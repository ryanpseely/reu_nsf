The goal of this program is to help students attain a higher level of independence in mathematical research by having them take part in significant and interesting research projects. Participants will be introduced to various tools, techniques, and problems from number theory and will work on important and often difficult problems that are suitable for undergraduate work. This program will not only provide the participants with the opportunities to broaden their knowledge in their research area but will also give participants the opportunity to become better expositors of their research. This will be accomplished through student lectures during and at the end of the program that will include two presentations in different formats. The PIs will organize an annual REU conference that will enable the students to interact with and learn from students in other REU programs in the region. The conference will provide the students with a valuable opportunity to deliver their first professional talk in a friendly atmosphere and will also help to disseminate the results obtained by the REU students. This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Sciences Research Experiences for Undergraduates Sites program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research program.<br/><br/>The theory of modular forms plays an important role in modern number theory, such as Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. In this program, various problems in modular forms will be introduced. These problems will offer a blend of computational investigation with the theoretical pursuit of fundamental problems in modular forms or, more generally, in number theory. The problems are specifically chosen so that the participants will be able to begin investigations almost immediately on computational aspects of the projects, giving them an opportunity to spend the entire time at Clemson working on meaningful research. Potential research projects include but are not limited to studying the distribution of zeros of certain modular forms or period polynomials, investigating properties of higher coefficients of Hecke polynomials, and analyzing traces of Hecke operators on certain types of modular forms. Many of these problems are natural extensions or continuations of the results obtained in the previous REUs.

Today, massive computational resources are required to train even a single state-of-the-art deep learning model (e.g., large language models or LLMs). As the need for training massive DNN models continues and expands from the private sector to NSF-supported scientists and engineers (who are more likely to use shared computing resources), efficient checkpointing is emerging as a critical need. Checkpointing not only helps deal with failures but also provides more scheduling flexibility on shared HPC resources, as a very long-running job can be broken into several shorter ones. The premise of the CropDL project is that efficient and automated application-level checkpoint and restart will be critical to facilitating the use of shared HPC clusters for long-running ML training tasks, drastically increasing the number of researchers that can successfully train large ML models for various applications. This project also contributes to education and diversity in multiple aspects, for example, 1) introducing courses (or course material) to bring attention to ML-related workloads in computer systems undergraduate and graduate education; 2) integrating research tasks from this project with synergistic research programs at universities to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minority groups; and 3) supporting and training PhD students in their research, creating momentum on systems and cyberinfrastructure research related to emerging ML workloads and popularizing integrative research that combines the properties of these workloads with the complexities of modern HPC hardware.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of CropDL is to support application-level checkpoints/restarts of deep learning applications for better resiliency, faster average completion time, and higher resource utilization. Particularly, several properties of DL workloads (as compared to scientific computations) create distinct sets of opportunities and challenges for checkpointing: 1) limited communication patterns during parallel execution, which can enable efficient coordinated checkpoints, 2) many unique opportunities for compression of checkpoints, and possibly taking uncoordinated checkpoints, and 3) malleable execution, where restarting from a different number of nodes is possible. Based on this observation, the first direction of this project is to exploit the properties of the DNN model(s) to be trained during checkpointing. This includes asynchronous versioned checkpointing for DL applications under a wide variety of parallelism models as well as content-based data reduction (compression and sparsification) techniques to reduce checkpoint volumes. The second direction of research focuses on using current and upcoming HPC systems' resources efficiently while checkpointing. It formulates tasks, data, and I/O requirements from DL applications into DAG representations and develops methods to schedule them. It also supports efficient I/O for deep learning applications with emerging I/O platforms. The last direction is to automate checkpointing through a compilation system based on the computational graph of DL workloads. All these efforts consider a variety of parallelization schemes for DNNs, i.e., data, model, and/or pipelined parallelism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most existing works focus on proof-of-concept on relatively small, well-curated data, with offline settings, real-world scientific research, and applications need more capable GNN models, which can effectively learn from large-scale, real-time, geographically distributed (geo-distributed) and diversely different (heterogeneous) data. This project aims to chart a radically new cyberinfrastructure solution for training large-spatial GNNs to fill this gap. The success of this project will provide a cyberinfrastructure that overcomes the fundamental computational and communication bottlenecks for a broad range of domain science applications that rely on massive spatiotemporal prediction. The proposed algorithms and systems will be ideal for cultivating a deeper understanding of designing large machine-learning systems at a geo-distributed scale, teaching and training students and peers, and providing graduate and undergraduate students with new courses, research, and internship opportunities.<br/> <br/>This project aims to develop a comprehensive set of graph construction and partitioning methods, distributed learning algorithms, and cyberinfrastructure designs to support large-scale GNNs for real-world spatiotemporal data in geospatial scientific research and applications. The project will address significant research challenges, including (1) formulating spatiotemporal prediction within a geographically inspired graph deep learning framework, (2) enabling highly accurate, efficient, and cost-effective spatiotemporal prediction tasks across vast, geographically dispersed datasets, and (3) integrating spatial correlation, spatial heterogeneity, spatial computing parallelism, and geographic communication efficiency. The research is organized around several key research themes: (1) Creating a universal framework for constructing graphs from spatiotemporal data, determining spatial relationships, and filling in missing node attributes.

Scientists need to simulate ocean current circulation along the coasts to develop early warning systems that could save countless lives and prevent significant annual losses in developing countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Traditionally, such simulations are conducted by running numerical models on a high-performance computing (HPC) platform, which is both expensive and time-consuming. The last few years have witnessed a rapid transformation of the field driven by advances in deep learning and the emerging Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computational architecture. The main idea is to train neural network surrogates of numerical models, and once pre-trained, the networks can generate simulations with much faster speed and a smaller energy footprint. The project will develop a novel AI surrogate cyberinfrastructure for large-scale spatiotemporal simulations in coastal circulation. Educational activities will include curriculum development, mentoring a broad group of high school students in AI seminars at Summer Camps, as well as year-long projects for a selected number of high school students for the regional Science Fair competition. <br/><br/>The project will provide several innovations in AI and cyberinfrastructure research.

Widely adopted for resilience purposes by long-running applications (i.e., checkpoint-restart), it has seen an explosion of additional use cases that directly help applications progress faster and reduce time-to-solution even in the absence of failures: adjoint computations (essential in financial modeling, weather prediction, computational fluid dynamics, seismic imaging, and control theory) need to capture a history of checkpoints in a forward pass, which are then revisited in a backward pass. Training artificial intelligence models, increasingly used by scientific applications, often results in trajectories that do not lead to convergence or may lead to undesirable patterns, prompting the need to backtrack to an earlier checkpoint of the learning model to try an alternative. Transfer learning and fine-tuning using a previous checkpoint of a learning model can be used to adapt the training more quickly, avoiding expensive training from scratch. Many other use cases are important in scientific computing: suspend-resume (e.g., to preempt a long-running job in favor of a higher priority job), migration (checkpoint on one machine, restart on another), debugging (replay a problematic code region to reproduce errors without starting from scratch), and reproducibility (checkpoint and compare intermediate data during repeated runs). Despite broad applicability, current state-of-the-art solutions lack the flexibility, performance, and scalability needed to address these scenarios efficiently. The Versioned Lineage-Driven Checkpointing of Composable States (VLCC-States) project aims to fill this gap. It will streamline the development and use of checkpointing patterns for scientific applications, which simplifies and improves the reusability of integration efforts across different communities, improves awareness of the multitude of checkpointing scenarios, reduces development effort and cost, and enables flexible customization to extract the best performance and scalability for the desired application scenario.<br/><br/>VLCC-States provides technical innovation in three areas. First, it introduces composable providers of intermediate states, which hide the complexity of capturing and assembling checkpoints of distributed data structures and their transformations across different modules and programming languages while optimizing their layout to eliminate redundancies, reduce sizes, and improve performance. Second, it provides multi-level co-optimized caching and prefetching techniques, which enable scalable management of the life cycle of checkpoints for interleavings of capture and reuse operations on heterogeneous storage stacks under concurrency. Third, it develops specialized checkpointing tools for large Artificial Intelligence models, with a focus on integration with PyTorch and DeepSpeed, to enable users to transparently take advantage of high-performance and scalable checkpointing using a familiar API. This project will engage partners in industry and national research laboratories to co-design VLCC-States, tune its capabilities, and evaluate its implementation. This project will undertake educational and broadening participation activities to improve community awareness and understanding of challenges in scientific data management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These network architectures offer a dynamically changing connectivity pattern to enable efficient routing of messages. Recent hardware advances enable network reconfiguration within microseconds or even nanoseconds. At time scales such as these, networking becomes an intricately choreographed dance, with data traveling along paths whose links come into being while network packets are in flight. The design space of network architectures that take advantage of this capability is ripe for foundational theoretical exploration and prototype systems. This project will seize the opportunity, developing new foundations and systems for reconfigurable networking.  The project will also have direct educational outcomes. The investigators will run related summer schools, workshops, and outreach activities that aim to increase the diversity of researchers participating in these areas. The code and systems developed during the project will be open-sourced for scientists, researchers in the community and/or practitioners in the industry for experimentation and evaluation.<br/><br/>The research will involve a close coupling of theory and systems development, leading to contributions to both sub-disciplines of computer science.  On the theory side, the research will shed light on fundamental tradeoffs in reconfigurable network design. In particular, the research will focus on an emerging paradigm in reconfigurable datacenter networking, namely oblivious reconfigurable networking (ORN), where both the connection reconfiguration and routing happen in a network-demand-oblivious manner. The research will add to the understanding of how to design oblivious routing schemes with very low path stretch and how to design semi-oblivious routing schemes superior to oblivious ones, with likely implications beyond the setting of reconfigurable networks to the theory of oblivious routing in general. The research will also expand the emerging ?algorithms with predictions? paradigm to incorporate reconfigurable networking. On the systems side, the research will use the findings from theory to build practical and scalable reconfigurable datacenter networks. In that regard, the research will design an all-optical reconfigurable network architecture that could scale to an entire datacenter. Further, the research will resolve two practical network design problems, namely congestion control and quality-of-service, in the novel context of oblivious reconfigurable networks.

Unlike conventional side-channel vulnerabilities, the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel emission leaks information over wireless channel, offering a unique medium to investigate IoT security without accessing or instrumenting the device. Unfortunately, current research on the EM side-channel attacks of IoT devices has been severely limited by the lack of a practical sensing system that can extract weak EM signals emitted by computer processors or memories, separate those EM signals of co-located devices, and robustly unravel their semantics. To tackle these challenges, this project will design, implement, and evaluate a practical EM sensing system named EMRadar to enable research on EM side-channel attacks and defenses in real environments. The results of this project will deepen our understanding of EM side-channel attacks and inform emission security standards. Practical EM side-channel defenses enabled by this project will transform various security-critical IoT applications, including detecting program deviations in medical devices that are highly resource-constrained, such as the implantable cardiac devices and the smart insulin pumps. The project is dedicated to fostering diversity and inclusion in STEM by blending research with education and outreach activities. The PI will actively involve local high school students by providing hands-on activities and presentations elucidating fundamental concepts of IoT technologies and cybersecurity. To bridge the gap in STEM participation, the project will engage students from underrepresented minority groups in Detroit and Pontiac as well as various Michigan-based organizations for girls. This endeavor is supported by collaborations with the Oakland University's STEM summer camps and field trips, as well as the Michigan Aspirations in Computing Committee. Through these initiatives, the project will inspire a broad spectrum of students to pursue futures in engineering and science.<br/><br/>This project will design, implement, and evaluate the EMRadar, a practical EM sensing system that enables research on EM side-channel attacks and defenses in realistic environments. The proposed research will build on a three-layer architecture model. (1) In the sensing layer, EMRadar will incorporate innovative signal processing techniques to extract weak EM signals that are deeply buried in noise and contaminated by interference. To achieve this, the EMRadar will exploit the unique characteristics of EM emissions from a processor or memory and IoT software behavior, enabling novel methods that can adapt and optimize signal processing techniques used in classic Radar systems for highly sensitive EM sensing. (2) In the representation layer, this project will explore universal representation and classification of EM signals to unravel EM side-channel emissions of processors and memories. Despite extensive studies on EM side-channel emissions, accurate explanation of the semantics of EM side-channel signals remains highly challenging due to significant variation of EM signal pattern and the EM interference produced by workloads running on the same device. This project will leverage the recent advances in time series analysis and machine learning to revisit the representation of EM signals, and conduct a systematic measurement study to understand the robustness of universal representation across IoT devices with different architectures. (3) In the application layer, the EMRadar will be evaluated in real-world setups and applications. The PI will collaborate with domain experts to explore applications of the system developed in this project, such as supporting efficient IoT-based applications in healthcare, automobile industry, and intelligent buildings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These network architectures offer a dynamically changing connectivity pattern to enable efficient routing of messages. Recent hardware advances enable network reconfiguration within microseconds or even nanoseconds. At time scales such as these, networking becomes an intricately choreographed dance, with data traveling along paths whose links come into being while network packets are in flight. The design space of network architectures that take advantage of this capability is ripe for foundational theoretical exploration and prototype systems. This project will seize the opportunity, developing new foundations and systems for reconfigurable networking.  The project will also have direct educational outcomes. The investigators will run related summer schools, workshops, and outreach activities that aim to increase the diversity of researchers participating in these areas. The code and systems developed during the project will be open-sourced for scientists, researchers in the community and/or practitioners in the industry for experimentation and evaluation.<br/><br/>The research will involve a close coupling of theory and systems development, leading to contributions to both sub-disciplines of computer science.  On the theory side, the research will shed light on fundamental tradeoffs in reconfigurable network design. In particular, the research will focus on an emerging paradigm in reconfigurable datacenter networking, namely oblivious reconfigurable networking (ORN), where both the connection reconfiguration and routing happen in a network-demand-oblivious manner. The research will add to the understanding of how to design oblivious routing schemes with very low path stretch and how to design semi-oblivious routing schemes superior to oblivious ones, with likely implications beyond the setting of reconfigurable networks to the theory of oblivious routing in general. The research will also expand the emerging ?algorithms with predictions? paradigm to incorporate reconfigurable networking. On the systems side, the research will use the findings from theory to build practical and scalable reconfigurable datacenter networks. In that regard, the research will design an all-optical reconfigurable network architecture that could scale to an entire datacenter. Further, the research will resolve two practical network design problems, namely congestion control and quality-of-service, in the novel context of oblivious reconfigurable networks. Finally, the research will develop a full network stack for oblivious reconfigurable networks, and propose novel hardware designs for a fast and scalable implementation of the network stack.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To obtain robust results, making weak model assumptions is desirable. This project focuses on two sets of tools without making assumptions about the functional form of any effect of a predictor on the survival time: one is a classical approach based on spline basis expansion, and the other is a modern approach based on deep neural networks. For the spline method, the project aims to develop a generally applicable distributional theory for the estimates of unknown functions in several widely used survival models, which is needed for making proper statistical inference but still lacking in the current literature. Furthermore, the deep neural network approach makes the weakest possible assumption and is the most flexible estimating method for an unknown multivariate function. The project considers deep neural networks with a full likelihood-based loss function for censored survival data and more general types of predictors that can randomly vary with time. The project aims to investigate both the numerical implementation and the theory for the estimation precision. This work will foster interdisciplinary research with epidemiologists, nephrologists, neurologists, and other scientists working on real scientific studies, and contribute to the well-being of human beings and the scientific community in a significant way through its versatile real-life applications, thus create an impact in and beyond statistical periphery. <br/><br/>Spline basis expansion is a commonly used approach for approximating an unknown smooth function, hence widely applied in estimating functional parameters. It is too often, however, that the approximation is treated as ?exact? in practice so to treat a nonparametric estimation problem as a parametric one because the asymptotic distributional theory for the spline estimation is lacking for models beyond the nonparametric linear model. The project takes advantages of recent developments in the random matrix theory to tackle the distributional theoretical problem of spline estimates in a broad range of commonly used statistical models in censored data analysis. The most general nonparametric problem is to estimate the conditional distribution other than, for example, the conditional mean or median. With the conditional distribution at hand, prediction becomes a choice of a particular characteristic of the conditional distribution and a prediction interval can be easily obtained. The project focuses on full likelihood-based loss functions characterized by the conditional hazard function and applies either deep neural networks or deep operator networks for the estimation of the conditional distribution function given functional covariates. In survival analysis, the functional covariates can be time-varying covariates that affect the hazard function in an arbitrarily way, for which no estimating method exists in the literature. Convergence rates of considered neural network methods with functional inputs will be established.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these records provide a high resolution view of how polar temperatures changed through time, it is not always clear what Earth process influence Antarctic climate. One likely contributor to Antarctic temperature changes is the cyclic changes in Earth?s orientation as it orbits the sun. These so-called Milankovitch cycles control the amount and pattern of sunlight reaching the polar regions, that in turn result in periods of climatic warming or cooling. While the orbital variations and control on incoming solar energy remain well understood, how they influence Antarctic climate remains unresolved. It is the goal of this project to determine how variations in Earth?s orbit may be locally influencing Antarctic temperatures. The researchers on this project are pursing this goal by identifying periods of past ice melting on the surface of Antarctica using minerals that precipitate from the meltwaters that resulted from past warm periods.  The timing of this past melting will be determined by radioisotopic dating of the minerals using the natural radioactive decay of uranium to thorium. By dating numerous samples, collected in past scientific expeditions throughout the Antarctic continent, these researchers aim to reconstruct the frequency and spatial pattern of past warming and in doing so,  determine what aspect of Earth?s orbital variations influences Antarctic ice loss.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>Antarctic ice cores provide high resolution records of Pleistocene Southern Hemisphere temperatures that show an overall coherence with Northern Hemisphere temperature variations. One explanation for this bi-hemispheric temperature covariance relies on changes in atmospheric CO2 that result from varying northern hemisphere insolation. An alternative posits that the apparent coherence of polar temperatures is due to the misleading covariance between northern hemisphere summer insolation and, the southern hemisphere summer duration.  At present there is an insufficient understanding of the role that local insolation plays in Antarctic climate. The goal of this research project is to identify the temporal spatial patterns of solar forcing in Antarctica. To reach this goal, the project team will: 1) develop a way to identify periods of past surface melt production in Antarctica using U-Th dating of pedogenic carbonates; and 2) utilize the evidence of past surface melting to calibrate energy balance models and interrogate past Antarctic surface temperatures and; 3) compare the timing of Antarctic warm periods to potential solar forcing mechanisms such as peak summer insolation or summer duration. A means of identifying the spatial and temporal pattern at which local insolation influences Antarctic temperature would provide a transformative solution to the contradiction in current climate records.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, massive computational resources are required to train even a single state-of-the-art deep learning model (e.g., large language models or LLMs). As the need for training massive DNN models continues and expands from the private sector to NSF-supported scientists and engineers (who are more likely to use shared computing resources), efficient checkpointing is emerging as a critical need. Checkpointing not only helps deal with failures but also provides more scheduling flexibility on shared HPC resources, as a very long-running job can be broken into several shorter ones. The premise of the CropDL project is that efficient and automated application-level checkpoint and restart will be critical to facilitating the use of shared HPC clusters for long-running ML training tasks, drastically increasing the number of researchers that can successfully train large ML models for various applications. This project also contributes to education and diversity in multiple aspects, for example, 1) introducing courses (or course material) to bring attention to ML-related workloads in computer systems undergraduate and graduate education; 2) integrating research tasks from this project with synergistic research programs at universities to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minority groups; and 3) supporting and training PhD students in their research, creating momentum on systems and cyberinfrastructure research related to emerging ML workloads and popularizing integrative research that combines the properties of these workloads with the complexities of modern HPC hardware.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of CropDL is to support application-level checkpoints/restarts of deep learning applications for better resiliency, faster average completion time, and higher resource utilization. Particularly, several properties of DL workloads (as compared to scientific computations) create distinct sets of opportunities and challenges for checkpointing: 1) limited communication patterns during parallel execution, which can enable efficient coordinated checkpoints, 2) many unique opportunities for compression of checkpoints, and possibly taking uncoordinated checkpoints, and 3) malleable execution, where restarting from a different number of nodes is possible. Based on this observation, the first direction of this project is to exploit the properties of the DNN model(s) to be trained during checkpointing. This includes asynchronous versioned checkpointing for DL applications under a wide variety of parallelism models as well as content-based data reduction (compression and sparsification) techniques to reduce checkpoint volumes. The second direction of research focuses on using current and upcoming HPC systems' resources efficiently while checkpointing. It formulates tasks, data, and I/O requirements from DL applications into DAG representations and develops methods to schedule them. It also supports efficient I/O for deep learning applications with emerging I/O platforms. The last direction is to automate checkpointing through a compilation system based on the computational graph of DL workloads. All these efforts consider a variety of parallelization schemes for DNNs, i.e., data, model, and/or pipelined parallelism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists need to simulate ocean current circulation along the coasts to develop early warning systems that could save countless lives and prevent significant annual losses in developing countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Traditionally, such simulations are conducted by running numerical models on a high-performance computing (HPC) platform, which is both expensive and time-consuming. The last few years have witnessed a rapid transformation of the field driven by advances in deep learning and the emerging Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computational architecture. The main idea is to train neural network surrogates of numerical models, and once pre-trained, the networks can generate simulations with much faster speed and a smaller energy footprint. The project will develop a novel AI surrogate cyberinfrastructure for large-scale spatiotemporal simulations in coastal circulation. Educational activities will include curriculum development, mentoring a broad group of high school students in AI seminars at Summer Camps, as well as year-long projects for a selected number of high school students for the regional Science Fair competition. <br/><br/>The project will provide several innovations in AI and cyberinfrastructure research.

Sharing data yields transformative effects in multiple areas, including improving healthcare through patient data sharing, banks improving fraud detection via transaction data sharing, and epidemiologists optimizing public policy interventions by sharing data. But sharing data is hard. Four challenges get in the way: compliance, incentives, preparation, and execution. Current sharing solutions often address these challenges independently, resulting in either partial solutions or complex systems that are difficult to construct, maintain, and reuse. Consequently, the complexity and high costs hinder realizing data-sharing opportunities and their associated value. In this project data-sharing applications are treated as data markets, which paves the way for designing reusable sharing infrastructure. Data markets promise to distribute the value of data to more people and sectors than ever, across both public and private organizations. As data markets garner influence in our lives, methodologies that detect potential problems early are essential. This project introduces both novel techniques to account for the value of data and new theories, algorithms, and systems for designing and implementing data-sharing markets. While data sharing is currently mostly ad-hoc and hard-to-control, this project will enable judicious design and implementation of data markets geared towards reaping the value of data. The project will contribute to knowledge about existing and future data markets, and the research and education objectives of the project will contribute to a better understanding of techniques to gain value from data.<br/><br/>Despite the value of data, currently, data sharing is hard. This project addresses this issue by proposing the concept of programmable data-sharing markets, which permits market designers to implement data-sharing market applications through a programming framework and deploy those applications in a data escrow, a system with computational support for controlling dataflows. The project's technical activities include designing and implementing the data-sharing programming framework, analyzing and deriving constraints, invariants, and impossibilities of dataflow control, thus aiding in designing and implementing data markets, and evaluating the technical contributions. The dissemination activities include organizing technical workshops, including dataflow control topics on classes and open source content, and generating written articles for both technical and general audiences that elucidate the value of data and techniques to reap that value.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

She will also develop and offer a disciplinary writing workshop series for graduate students in Physics and Astronomy.<br/><br/>Polarimetry is a key technology for resolving dusty disks around other stars; historically, however, high-contrast polarimetric capabilities have been mostly restricted to observing bright stars due to limitations of adaptive optics systems. The investigator will create a data processing pipeline and perform calibrations and commissioning observations for the upcoming Keck NIRC2 polarimetry upgrade, making Keck II the largest telescope on which infrared (Y to L band) polarimetry capabilities will be available. This polarimetry mode will be able to work in conjunction with the existing facility-grade laser guide star adaptive optics system to uniquely target fainter and redder stars than those accessible by other facilities. The investigator will use this mode to complete a survey of debris disks around K- and M-dwarf stars and analyze trends in their composition and morphology to inform planet formation models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These smart sensors can dramatically expand the field of view, enhance response speeds, and operate with energy efficiency. Central to this advancement is the fusion of photodiodes with artificial synapses and mimicry of geometrical shape, a pairing that mirrors the biological processes of neural networks within the insect eye. This configuration not only facilitates the rapid processing of visual information but also reduces the energy required to do so, marking a significant step forward from traditional planar imaging systems. Unlike conventional systems, the sensor arrays will adopt hemispherical designs, inspired by nature's own solution to wide-angle and efficient vision. This geometric optimization is crucial for capturing the patterns of movement across a visual scene with enhanced accuracy and depth, making the technology invaluable for applications that require precise motion detection and spatial awareness. To process the high-dimensional data captured by these sensors, the project further introduces a specialized neural network architecture. This approach divides data processing tasks between the sensors and a central processing unit, ensuring swift, efficient, and precise analysis. Such a configuration is particularly suited for dynamic environments where rapid decision-making is essential. By emulating the intricate vision systems found in nature, it offers a glimpse into a future where technology and biology converge, providing impactful solutions. The potential applications of this work span across various sectors, promising to enhance the efficiency, and capabilities of systems in robotics, autonomous driving, and beyond, thereby advancing the progress of science and technology for the benefit of society.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and integrate a novel artificial compound eye system capable of advanced in-situ object tracking and depth perception.

The hardware design, inspired by the hemispherical structure of arthropod eyes, enables a wide field of view and rapid image acquisition. To address the challenges of processing high-dimensional visual data efficiently, a communication, storage, and energy-efficient federated split learning framework will be employed. This framework optimizes data processing by distributing computational tasks between the sensor and a centralized processing unit, significantly enhancing the system's real-time object tracking capabilities. By integrating advanced hardware with software algorithms, this project aims to create a system that not only advances the scientific understanding of bio-inspired imaging but also offers practical solutions for real-world applications.

Today, massive computational resources are required to train even a single state-of-the-art deep learning model (e.g., large language models or LLMs). As the need for training massive DNN models continues and expands from the private sector to NSF-supported scientists and engineers (who are more likely to use shared computing resources), efficient checkpointing is emerging as a critical need. Checkpointing not only helps deal with failures but also provides more scheduling flexibility on shared HPC resources, as a very long-running job can be broken into several shorter ones. The premise of the CropDL project is that efficient and automated application-level checkpoint and restart will be critical to facilitating the use of shared HPC clusters for long-running ML training tasks, drastically increasing the number of researchers that can successfully train large ML models for various applications. This project also contributes to education and diversity in multiple aspects, for example, 1) introducing courses (or course material) to bring attention to ML-related workloads in computer systems undergraduate and graduate education; 2) integrating research tasks from this project with synergistic research programs at universities to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minority groups; and 3) supporting and training PhD students in their research, creating momentum on systems and cyberinfrastructure research related to emerging ML workloads and popularizing integrative research that combines the properties of these workloads with the complexities of modern HPC hardware.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of CropDL is to support application-level checkpoints/restarts of deep learning applications for better resiliency, faster average completion time, and higher resource utilization. Particularly, several properties of DL workloads (as compared to scientific computations) create distinct sets of opportunities and challenges for checkpointing: 1) limited communication patterns during parallel execution, which can enable efficient coordinated checkpoints, 2) many unique opportunities for compression of checkpoints, and possibly taking uncoordinated checkpoints, and 3) malleable execution, where restarting from a different number of nodes is possible. Based on this observation, the first direction of this project is to exploit the properties of the DNN model(s) to be trained during checkpointing. This includes asynchronous versioned checkpointing for DL applications under a wide variety of parallelism models as well as content-based data reduction (compression and sparsification) techniques to reduce checkpoint volumes. The second direction of research focuses on using current and upcoming HPC systems' resources efficiently while checkpointing. It formulates tasks, data, and I/O requirements from DL applications into DAG representations and develops methods to schedule them. It also supports efficient I/O for deep learning applications with emerging I/O platforms. The last direction is to automate checkpointing through a compilation system based on the computational graph of DL workloads. All these efforts consider a variety of parallelization schemes for DNNs, i.e., data, model, and/or pipelined parallelism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But in reality, the specific model that is deployed is just one option of many: previous work has shown that multiplicity ? the existence of multiple equally good models ? arises at many stages of the machine learning pipeline. Formally reasoning about multiplicity is challenging due to the large (potentially infinite) set of models one has to take into account. As such, existing techniques are currently only able to reason about certain forms of model-based multiplicity, and generally only with empirical guarantees. This project?s novelties are a set of approaches that increase the auditability of machine learning pipelines. These techniques consist of frameworks and formal techniques to understand how multiplicity in the dataset creation and modeling processes impacts the final learned model that is deployed.  The project?s impacts are especially prominent in domains where the decisions of machine learned models directly affect humans --- understanding multiplicity is vital for developing machine learning models that are fair and robust. The investigators are involved with organizing outreach programs to expose high schoolers and undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds to computer science and topics in machine learning.<br/><br/>This project investigates multiplicity for diverse model architectures across the whole machine learning pipeline including training data, model predictions, and model explanations. The research integrates formal methods and robust machine learning techniques to provide techniques to help answer the question of whether machine learning outcomes are reliable, or whether they are just an artifact of multiplicity. For instance, the investigators study algorithms to certify (deterministically or probabilistically, depending on the model architecture) whether a model?s prediction is robust under various sources of multiplicity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this serial execution proves to be too slow. Processors thus seek instructions that can safely execute in parallel to enhance performance. Yet, implementing parallelism in hardware is extremely complicated. The complexity renders processors inefficient and insecure, leading the industry's shift toward specialized hardware accelerators tailored to run specific programs exceptionally well. Unfortunately, these accelerators are costly and restrictive. To address these issues, this project proposes post-von Neumann, dataflow processors, that explicitly expose program parallelism to dramatically simplify hardware. Through new compilation software and simplified parallel hardware, the project aims to significantly improve energy efficiency and system correctness. These advancements will transcend von Neumann model limitations, fostering innovation while enhancing performance, efficiency, and security. The research will be conducted by a diverse team, including undergraduates through the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. Moreover, the investigators will develop an outreach program to educate K-12 teachers and the public on various computing models.<br/><br/>The key technical innovation of this award is the innately parallel dataflow representation of programs and a simple, spatial implementation of a dataflow processor. Moreover, the spatial architecture adopts a hierarchical, modular approach that enables scalability in multiple dimensions. Simplicity and modularity admit tractable formal models of the compiler, architecture, and hardware implementation, allowing investigators to prove correctness and security. The proposed architecture builds in security from the beginning, rather than trying to prove security after the fact, as researchers currently struggle to do for von Neumann architectures. Modularity further enables scalable compilation by breaking programs into smaller, independent units with a well-defined interface, each of which can be efficiently compiled onto the proposed architecture, and also enables near-data computation by co-locating data with its corresponding computation to overcome the rising cost of data movement. The resulting processor design promises to be the first a scalable, general-purpose architecture with provable correctness and security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymer networks are ubiquitous materials ranging from stiff, strong wind turbines, to stretchy rubber in tires and gloves, to soft gels in bandages. While all of these materials are based on interconnected polymer strands, a wide range of properties can be achieved by controlling the structure of the polymer strands, including controlling how densely they interconnect, and whether these interconnections are static or dynamic. The Kalow lab will combine dynamic bonds with molecular switches that change their structure in response to light. This combination is expected  to provide for control over the number of bonds or how quickly they exchange with different colors of light, a widely available, precise, and tunable energy source. By incorporating these switchable dynamic bonds into a polymer network, the Kalow lab aims to create adaptable materials capable of on-demand changes in stiffness and flow. Potential applications of these materials include soft robotics, materials with on-demand recyclability, and tissue mimics. To improve accessibility in polymer education and outreach, the Kalow lab will also develop experiments and lesson plans for learners who are blind or have low vision, by collaborating with local organizations serving these individuals. These activities will allow learners to explore the polymer properties of edible gels by using touch and taste.<br/><br/>The Kalow lab takes a bottom-up approach to control polymer network mechanics by coupling photoswitches to dynamic crosslink reactivity. In principle, this approach will allow for the reversible photocontrol of mechanical properties such as stiffness and viscoelasticity.  This research will expose students to physical organic chemistry, synthesis, polymer chemistry, and polymer physics. Specific objectives include the design of aqueous-compatible switchable crosslinks for hydrogels and switches that control crosslink exchange rate; these goals will be enabled by the development of high throughput methods for preparing and testing photoswitches.

While historical approaches often necessitated the lifelong collection of data and analysis of talented scholars, modern computing technologies have revolutionized methods of scientific discovery. Today, advanced computing machines and machine learning (ML) facilitate the rapid analysis of large-scale complex data. However, current approaches often rely on opaque ""black-box"" ML models. They suffer from a lack of physically-consistency, generalizability, and/or interpretability. To address these limitations, this CAREER project focuses on establishing a synergistic research and education program to advance methods of scientific discovery. The core research idea of the project is to embed physics domain knowledge into the design of deep-learning (DL) models. By augmenting strong physics-based model designs with carefully formulated hypotheses and massive data collections, this approach will produce novel DL models that enforce the principles of physics to strongly restrict search spaces of model outcomes to be physically consistent. This innovative approach is expected to greatly accelerate the process of scientific discovery and enhance its efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability. The expected outcome of this project is also widely applicable to relevant research areas such as Thermodynamics and Molecular dynamics.<br/><br/>This project investigates data-driven scientific discovery of complex spatiotemporal physical processes. It aims to achieve the following specific goals: to develop (1) physically-consistent dynamics models, which exactly preserve important physical characteristics by imposing strong physics biases to the design of neural networks; (2) DL-based symbolic regression algorithms to infer interpretable mathematical expressions of target dynamics models, where the model structures are designed to conform to principles of physics; and, (3) multimodal DL algorithms for scientific applications that leverage data that exist in different modalities. In addition, this project seeks to develop (4) physics-inspired DL models for data science downstream tasks by leveraging findings from the above tasks, contributing to ML research. An interdisciplinary course will be developed based on the project outcomes to educate researchers, students at all levels, and the broader communities.

The analysis of non-smooth spaces is a vital area of research with diverse applications across the mathematical and physical sciences, including fluid mechanics, neurophysiology, and fractal geometry.  The PI will investigate the large-scale geometric behavior of objects in these spaces using the mathematical tools of local and nonlocal energies.   Given a function measuring a physical phenomenon, such as temperature or momentum, local energies measure the function?s nearby or small-scale oscillations, while nonlocal energies measure its variations over long distances.  A primary goal of this work is to develop much-needed mathematical tools for analyzing nonlocal energies.  The project will also enhance the professional training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, through collaborative research projects, instruction in effective mathematical communication, and opportunities for research interactions with undergraduate students.  <br/><br/><br/>The primary objects of study in this project are represented as metric measure spaces that lack smooth structure. The finite dimensionality of the ambient space is represented by the property of supporting a doubling Radon measure. In such a setting, nearby or asymptotic oscillation of a function is measured using upper gradients, which are viable substitutes for the derivative of a function, and the local energy is associated with the collection of functions on the object, called Sobolev functions. The large-scale variation energy is associated with the collection called Besov space of functions. Recent research has uncovered a connection between local energies on a region in a metric measure space and nonlocal energies on the boundary of the region. The project will leverage this connection to explore the large-scale geometry of nonlocal energies on the boundary of the region by linking them with small-scale behavior of local energies on the region itself. In particular, connections between Dirichlet-type boundary value problems and Neumann-type boundary value problems will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such data is often very challenging to acquire in specialized domains such as healthcare, legislation, environmental sciences due to the high costs involved in obtaining high-grade human labels and data privacy concerns. This project will advance science by providing algorithms, software, and systems that can automatically generate high-quality labeled data to mitigate the lack of labeled training data in specific domains and and allow training of highly accurate machine learning models. The project will significantly broaden the applicability of machine learning across various application areas by lowering data barriers and will substantially reduce the labor costs of manual data annotation. For example, it will promote scientific discovery in structural biology and high-energy physics and streamline engineering design in wireless communication. It will facilitate the early detection of sepsis, lung cancer, Parkinson's disease, and sleep apnea, improving patient outcomes and quality of life. Applied to compound design and cement production, the developed technologies have the potential to expedite drug discovery and reduce energy consumption. <br/><br/>To achieve the goal of creating high-quality labeled training data, this project will develop three complementary paradigms of novel approaches based on multi-level optimization and large language models, for: 1) end-to-end generation of labeled data; 2) annotation of unlabeled data; and, 3) example-specific adaptation/selection of labeled source data, respectively. First, the proposed data generation methods will leverage the worst-case and class-specific performance of downstream models to provide end-to-end and fine-grained guidance for generating data (with complex labels) that is tailored to improve the accuracy and robustness of downstream models, and to promote balanced performance across different classes. Second, the proposed data annotation methods will leverage an end-to-end mechanism that capitalizes on large language models, a sequence of verification procedures, and available side information to maximize the accuracy of generated labels. Third, the proposed adaptation/selection methods will distinguish between source examples that are inside or outside of a target domain and subsequently determine an example-specific adaptation/selection action end-to-end to ensure optimal use of source data. In addition, the proposed novel optimization algorithms and distributed systems will effectively tackle new challenges related to multi-level optimization, including non-differentiability, incompatibility with the optimizers of large language models, and scalability. This project represents the first one systematically leveraging multi-level optimization to create labeled data, effectively addressing a fundamental knowledge gap that existing methods often lack capabilities to perform end-to-end execution of multiple learning stages and therefore fall short in tailoring generated data to improve downstream models? performance. Another significant innovation of this project is its effective harnessing of large language models for data annotation, which will substantially reduce the costs of manual labeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This can be achieved via polarimetric imaging, which considers polarization of light that corresponds to every pixel in an image to create a better image of the object. Polarization of light can be thought of as compartmentalizing the electromagnetic light wave into subcomponents. These subcomponents are used by polarimetric cameras to reveal information that is normally not available in regular cameras. With the introduction of commercial polarimetric cameras in 2018, there has been a growing interest in polarization for computer graphics, physics-based modeling, and vision algorithms. Common indoor environments exhibit relatively small polarization attributes that can still provide valuable information. These can be modeled computationally and can be used to augment the capabilities provided by traditional cameras.  This project envisions simulating the polarization attributes of indoor environments to answer the question: ?If polarization sensitivity is added to webcams, conferencing capture systems, and cellphone cameras, what new capabilities will be possible?? This project will provide the research community with an open-source polarization image library and data synthesis pipeline to demonstrate our novel computational approaches, which can be adapted for vision, graphics, and the design of capture systems in the pursuit of informatics from commercial polarimetry. Training Native American researchers for entrepreneurial pursuits at the intersection of computational and optical sciences is a legacy goal of this research. The education plan will rely on the University of Arizona?s exemplary Native American student resources. To increase students? awareness of the economic opportunities made possible by their education, entrepreneurship will be valued and practiced in research activities.<br/><br/>This research will investigate from three perspectives: mathematical (e.g., inverse problems), computational (e.g., Monte Carlo ray tracing), and optical physics (e.g., appropriate physical assumptions for commonplace indoor materials). Current simulations rely on generic representations of polarimetric light-matter interactions that are overly complex and lack insight from empirical observations. This research will investigate fundamental changes to computing polarized light-matter interactions that are: (i) compressed by a factor of two given simplifications appropriate for many indoor materials; (ii) physically constrained when interpolated or averaged; (iii) compatible with quaternion rotation; and (iv) statistically evaluated using a representation that facilitates importance sampling in the polarimetric domain. The improved accuracy and computational efficiency of our proposed approach will enable unprecedented exploration of plausible inverse solutions. Our library of indoor polarimetry will be a new resource for data-driven learning methods and a long-term impact of this research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mart and Matteo Pasquali of Rice University are developing chemical methods to control the surface functionalities and physical properties in nanotubes made from the chemical elements boron and nitrogen.  Boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are tubular nanoarchitectures, similar in structure to carbon nanotubes (CNT), but with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms instead of carbon.  BNNTs have particular properties, such as high thermal conductivity (similar to copper), wide band gap, chemical and thermal stability, and high Young?s modulus (stiffness).  As such, BNNTs are highly desirable building blocks with applications in aerospace materials, heat and chemically resistant composites, radiation shielding, and electrical insulators with high thermal conductivity.   This research has the potential to advance the knowledge of surface functionalization of chemically inert BNNTs through a systematic covalent modification approach.  The research team will promote and recruit underserved students from diverse backgrounds through ongoing collaborations with Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP), the Chemistry Department at the University of Puerto Rico, Ro Piedras and Mayagez, and the Tapia Center for Excellence and Equity in Education at Rice University.

Number theory is an ancient branch of mathematics concerned with the whole numbers and primes.  Some basic results in number theory are the infinitude of primes and the formula which gives all the Pythagorean triples.  Topology is the study of shapes, but one doesn't remember details like length and angles;  the surfaces of a donut and a coffee mug are famously indistinguishable to a topologist.  An overarching theme in topology is to invent invariants to distinguish among shapes.  For instance, a pair of pants is different from a straw because ""number of holes"" is an invariant which assigns different values to them (2 and 1 respectively, but one has to be precise about what a hole is).  The notion of ""hole"" can be generalized to higher dimensions:  a sphere has no 1-dimensional hole, but it does have a 2-dimensional hole and even a 3-dimensional hole (known as the Hopf fibration, discovered in 1931).  There are ""spheres"" in every dimension, and the determination of how many holes each one has is a major unsolved problem in topology.  Lately, the topologists' methods have encroached into the domain of number theory.  In particular the branch of number theory known as p-adic geometry, involving strange number systems allowing for decimal places going off infinitely far to the left, has made an appearance.  The principal investigator will draw upon his expertise in p-adic geometry to make contributions to the counting-holes-in-spheres problem.  He will also organize conferences and workshops with the intent of drawing together number theorists and topologists together, as currently these two realms are somewhat siloed from each other.  Finally, the principal investigator plans to train his four graduate students in methods related to this project.<br/><br/>The device which counts the number of holes in a shape is called the ""homotopy group"".  Calculating the homotopy groups of the spheres is notoriously difficult and interesting at the same time.   There is a divide-and-conquer approach to doing this known as chromatic homotopy theory, which replaces the sphere with its K(n)-localized version.  Here K(n) is the Morava K-theory spectrum.  Work in progress by the principal investigator and collaborators has identified the homotopy groups of the K(n)-local sphere up to a torsion subgroup.   The techniques used involve formal groups, p-adic geometry, and especially perfectoid spaces, which are certain fractal-like entities invented in 2012 by Fields Medalist Peter Scholze.  The next step in the project is to calculate the Picard group of the K(n)-local category, using related techniques.  After this, the principal investigator will turn his attention to the problem known as the ""chromatic splitting conjecture"", which has to do with iterated localizations of the sphere at different K(n).  This is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle required to assemble the homotopy groups of the spheres from their K(n)-local analogues.

To comprehensively study flood risk, one must focus on specific spatial scales, acknowledge variations within those areas, and evaluate the lasting impacts of floods on society. This project, jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the US and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), brings a team of scientists together to perform research that will develop a novel computer modeling approach that helps us understand and manage flood risk better. This approach is designed to create a modeling system that considers the natural conditions of the study area, people's perceptions and experiences related to floods, and factors such as governmental policies on buyouts and insurance. Most importantly, the research explicitly considers the differential impact of floods on vulnerable groups, including low-income, minority, disabled, and elderly individuals.<br/> <br/>The project is structured around three research tasks. The first focuses on establishing a comprehensive US-Japan flood risk data inventory, concentrating on existing and missing data related to marginalized groups. The work serves as a foundation for future collaborative flood research between the two countries. The second research task involves the development of a two-way coupled, multi-scale, agent-based flood risk catastrophe model that considers both marginalized and non-marginalized groups.

Recently it has been found that methane is seeping from the seafloor into the Atlantic Ocean along the Eastern United States. Methane seeps like these may be common along similar coastlines and thus may affect our climate. The reasons for these methane seeps will be studied using geological, chemical, and biological methods.  The project supports students at various levels and contributes to public understanding of the ocean through talks, publications, and videos.  Summer camps designed to inspire the next generation of ocean scientists will be developed. The field work and community outreach will improve our understanding of methane's role in climate and contribute to public understanding of and appreciation for ocean science.<br/><br/>This project will study biogeochemical and geological controls on recently discovered methane seeps in the northern US Atlantic Margin (200-1000m depth). Existing conceptual models of the origin, subsurface migration, characteristics, and history of methane discharge along continental margins would not predict the widespread presence and depth distribution of these seeps. This work will integrate geochemical, microbiological, geophysical, and geological data to investigate the genesis of seep fluids, fluid migration, and methane oxidation processes in a modern seep while reconstructing methane seepage characteristics and gas hydrate stability in the past. The project will combine geophysical characterization with the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry at active seep sites.  This will be combined with gravity and jumbo piston coring from ships as well as targeted sampling using the human occupied deep submergence vehicle ALVIN. This strategy will retrieve multiscale seafloor and sub-seafloor datasets, capturing a record longer than previously recovered at any other seep along this margin. The multi-pronged approach will contribute to an integrated and mechanistic understanding of continental margin methane seeps.<br/><br/> This project is jointly funded by the Directorate for Geoscience?s Chemical Oceanography and Marine Geology and Geophysics programs and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mentoring of graduate students in research is an important educational component of the project.<br/> <br/>The principal investigator will work on several projects in harmonic analysis. (i) The first project is concerned with the precise regularity properties of certain averages over sub-manifolds of Euclidean space and the boundedness of associated maximal operators in Lebesgue spaces. The PI will consider mainly non-convolution variants and emphasize various classes of spherical maximal operators on nilpotent groups. (ii) In a second project the PI will study versions of the local smoothing problem  for solutions of the wave equation when the dilation set is restricted. New phenomena show up even in the simplified version for radial functions. One expects that the outcomes depend on various notions of dimensions of the dilation sets, the Minkowski dimension, the quasi-Assouad dimension and intermediate scales of dimensions. The PI will also study the related problem concerns the Lp improving bounds for spherical maximal operators with restricted dilation sets, for the open case when the dilation set is not Assouad regular. (iii) The PI will pursue various projects on endpoint estimates in sparse domination, focusing on true multiscale phenomena. Atomic decompositions techniques and sharp Lp improving results for single-scaled operators play a crucial role.

It is a strong greenhouse gas, whose concentration has been increasing since the industrial revolution, and contributes about 6% to the total greenhouse effect.  N2O is also implicated in ozone depletion in the stratosphere.  The ocean is a net source of N2O to the atmosphere.  N2O is produced and consumed in the ocean by microbes as part of the nitrogen cycle. The conversion of N2O to N2 (dinitrogen gas) is the only known biological sink for N2O and is catalyzed by an enzyme that is strongly inhibited by oxygen, so N2O consumption has been thought to be confined to oxygen-free environments.  Thus, it was surprising to find that the genetic capability for N2O consumption was both present and active in the surface ocean, where oxygen is abundant. Experiments showed that surface ocean microbes rapidly consume N2O when oxygen is removed.  It appears that the microbes can use N2O as an alternative to oxygen for respiration.  Why would it be advantageous to retain this capacity in fully oxygenated surface water?  Does this potential N2O consumption constitute an actual sink for N2O, which might reduce the net transfer of N2O from the ocean to the atmosphere? <br/><br/>The reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to N2 is considered to be an obligately anaerobic process, usually restricted to anoxic environments in water and sediments.  Previous work showed that the genes (nosZ) encoding the N2O reductase enzyme were both present and expressed in the surface ocean, and that surface ocean samples rapidly reduce N2O to N2 when oxygen is removed.  The nosZ genes in surface waters appear to belong almost exclusively to microbes that do not perform the upstream steps in denitrification ? they are facultative N2O respirers.  The research proposed here will investigate the factors that might control or stimulate N2O reduction in surface waters and characterize the microbes responsible for the process. Experiments will test the hypothesis that N2O respirers are versatile heterotrophs whose activity is related to organic matter supply and possibly associated with particulate material or linked to in situ primary production.  Researchers will perform 15N tracer incubations to measure the rate of N2O reduction and its response to various kinds of organic substrates, including in situ particulate material and fresh phytoplankton exudates. The quantity and community composition of nosZ-containing microbes will be determined using a suite of molecular biological methods ? necessary because the nosZ gene is so diverse that previous methods have likely underestimated both its abundance and diversity and may not have identified the main microbes responsible for the process. Draft genomes of nosZ-containing microbes will be characterized to investigate their carbon metabolism and link their lifestyles to organic matter supply or phytoplankton.  One field expedition is planned to investigate the significance of N2O reduction in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre.  If N2O consumption occurs even at low rates over vast regions of the surface ocean, its impact on the overall N2O budget of the ocean and atmosphere could be large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A representation of an abstract algebraic object is a realization of the object via matrices of numbers. Often times, it is advantageous to view the entire collection of representations of an algebraic object as a structure known as a tensor category. Tensor categories consist of objects with additive and multiplicative operations like the integers or square matrices. Using the multiplicative operation, one can introduce the spectrum of the tensor category which is a geometric object (like a cone, sphere or torus). The PI will utilize the important connections between the algebraic and geometric properties of tensor categories to make advances in representation theory. The PI will continue to involve undergraduate and graduate students in these projects. He will continue to be an active member of the mathematical community by serving on national committees for the American Mathematical Society (AMS), and as an editor of a major mathematical journal.<br/><br/>The PI will develop new methods to study monoidal triangular geometry. Several central problems will utilize the construction of homological primes in the general monoidal setting and the introduction of a representation theory for MTCs. This representation theory promises to yield new information about the Balmer spectrum of the MTC. In particular, the general MTC theory will be applied to study representations of Lie superalgebras. The PI will also explore new ideas to study representations of classical simple Lie superalgebras. This involves systematically studying various versions of Category O and the rational representations for the associated quasi-reductive supergroups. One of the main ideas entails the use of the detecting and BBW parabolic subgroups/subalgebras. Furthermore, the PI will study the orbit structure of the nilpotent cone and will construct resolutions of singularities for the orbit closures. The PI will study important questions involving representations of reductive algebraic groups. Key questions will focus on the understanding the structures of induced representations, and whether these modules admit p-filtrations.

When oxygen supply is lower than demand (hypoxia), such as in tissue injury, host cells secrete signals to initiate repair processes. These secreted signals can be derived from epithelial cells that form a protective barrier in different organs (e.g., lungs). Macrophages, a key cell type in tissue homeostasis, integrate these signals to dynamically respond to their environment. The broader goal of this CAREER project is to advance the engineering science and biological understanding of cell-cell communication mechanisms under hypoxia. This will be accomplished by developing a microfluidic technology to faithfully model the interactions of macrophages with epithelial cells in a dynamic 3D environment. The proposed research will be integrated into an educational and outreach program at the pre-college and college levels. Underrepresented high-school students will be introduced to concepts of transport phenomena in immune cell function through a hands-on microfluidic camp, and every summer, one high school student will be hosted in the investigator?s lab for a mentored research program. Through collaboration with the Young Women in Bio and the Leading for Life organizations the investigator will develop outreach activities to attract women in STEM. Finally, results from the research objective on oxygen and secreted signal transport will be integrated into classroom activities at the graduate level. <br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term research goal is to create and use engineering approaches to elucidate the mechanisms influencing cellular adaptation under dysregulated oxygen levels and to actively modulate these mechanisms to restore homeostatic cellular function. To address this need, a novel microfluidic platform with integrated on-demand oxygen delivery will be engineered. This microfluidic technology will be used to dissect oxygen-regulated macrophage-epithelial crosstalk mechanisms that impact macrophage recruitment and proinflammatory cytokine profiles in a 3D collagen matrix. Furthermore, the effects of re-oxygenation on cellular stress pathways in hypoxia-conditioned macrophage-epithelial cocultures will be evaluated. Successful completion of the proposed work will yield 1) crucial advances in the fundamental understanding of how oxygen impacts key processes in macrophages including cell migration and 2) strategies to mitigate the proinflammatory state induced by hypoxic stress. In addition, this knowledge will facilitate the identification of novel targets for restoring tissue homeostasis and will impact the future design of experimental platforms to study cell migration in tissue morphogenesis and disease states. This approach can be extended to (a) study how dysregulated oxygen levels control additional fundamental processes, including nutrient uptake in tissue homeostasis, and (b) design new tissue-engineered systems with multi-parametric control of oxygen and biochemical inputs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research in dynamical systems is often focused on closed systems in which the dynamics are self-contained.  In many modeling situations, however, such a global view is not possible, and it becomes necessary to study local systems influenced by external dynamics, possibly on different spatial or temporal scales.  To better understand these phenomena, the PI will study open systems in which mass or energy may enter or exit through deterministic or random mechanisms, as well as large-scale systems of smaller interacting components that exchange mass or energy.  These problems are strongly motivated by connections with statistical mechanics and seek to advance our understanding of fundamental questions related to energy transport and diffusion.  This award will also support the involvement of undergraduates in mathematics research.  The highly visual nature and physical motivation of the problems will enable the investigator to recruit undergraduate students to participate in related research projects.  Special emphasis will be given to recruiting students from underrepresented groups in research mathematics.  Students will disseminate results of their research via poster sessions, conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.  By stimulating interest in research careers in mathematics and creating a peer community supportive of that interest, this award will contribute to the important goal of integrating research and education.<br/><br/>The funded research includes three specific projects.  The first project investigates the statistical and thermodynamic properties of both classical and non-equilibrium particle systems with collision interactions, an important class of models from statistical mechanics. The second concerns open systems, which relate on the one hand to physical systems in which mass or energy is allowed to escape, and on the other to the study of metastable states.  The third project generalizes open systems to include linked and extended dynamical systems comprised of two or more components that exchange mass or energy through deterministic or random mechanisms.  Important examples include the aperiodic Lorentz gas and mechanical models of heat conduction.  The investigator will bring to bear several analytical techniques that he has been instrumental in developing for these classes of systems, including his recent work concerning the spectral decomposition of transfer operators for dispersing particle systems, contractions in projective cones due to Birkhoff, and the construction of Markov extensions adapted to open systems.  None of these techniques require Markovian assumptions on the dynamics, making them widely applicable to a wide variety of nonuniformly hyperbolic and physically important systems.  The application of these techniques to central models from equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics will represent significant advances in the study of such systems.  Efforts to understand these tools in one context strengthens them and aids in their application to other areas of mathematics.  Their intellectual interest is enhanced by the application of these ideas to resolve problems posed and approached formally in the physics literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The United States has set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles by 2035. Achieving this goal requires methods to store large amounts of renewable energy to propel vehicles. Several technologies could contribute, including net-zero fuels such as hydrogen, methanol (via CO2 capture) and ammonia, as well as Li-ion batteries. Each of these technologies has strengths and weaknesses. Ammonia (NH3), is a gas that has some unique advantages over other technologies as a means to store renewable energy. Ammonia has a high energy density compared to batteries, is not a greenhouse gas, is easier to store than hydrogen because it liquifies at moderate pressure, and both its constituents, nitrogen and hydrogen, can be readily obtained from renewable sources. Ammonia can also be generated through multiple routes from renewable resources. While NH3 production has been optimized for fertilizer production, the extraction of energy from ammonia has been less researched. One approach is to extract energy from NH3 in the form of electricity. This can be accomplished by designing fuel cells to carry out chemical reactions that take electrons out of ammonia, pass them through an electrical consumer (such as a motor) and then transfer them to oxygen atoms from air. Overall, this reaction is environmentally sustainable as its byproducts are nitrogen and water. To date, however, ammonia fuel cells do not show competitive performance. One reason for this is that when NH3 is being transformed into electricity, a positively charged hydrogen atom (a so-called proton) is created, that needs to be transported from the anode to the cathode. Unfortunately, to date, electrolytes and electrolyte solvents that accomplish this transport interfere with the ammonia oxidation reaction. In this project, The team will study a new and untested approach to boost the efficiency of ammonia fuel cells. The project will use NH3 in its liquid form both as the fuel and as the electrolyte medium in ammonia fuel cells. As part of the work, the team will investigate the technical and economic feasibility of using liquid ammonia as a fuel cell electrolyte. To make this possible, the first goal is to understand the operation of molecular NH3 oxidation catalysts in liquid NH3. Secondly, the project will improve the operation of O2 reduction catalysts in the presence of liquid NH3 and finally, the team will use this combined knowledge to design full fuel cells that operate in liquid ammonia. The project will also consider both the social and environmental impacts of a transition to a new ammonia-based transport economy. The team will prioritize the recruitment of underrepresented students and will participate in outreach and engagement programs on the UW- Madison campus. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to elucidate the technical feasibility and economic, social, and environmental sustainability of using liquid NH3 as both the substrate and electrolyte for direct NH3 fuel cells. Even though the use of NH3 as electrolyte appears obvious, this approach has not been investigated to date. A series of challenges have to be addressed to realize this vision. These challenges involve understanding the operation of molecular NH3 oxidation catalysts in liquid NH3 medium, insight into the O2 reduction reaction in pure NH3, understanding the impact of added ammonium ions (NH4+) on proton conduction, NH3 oxidation and O2 reduction, and understanding the technical, economic and social viability of employing NH3 as an electrolyte in fuel cells. To accomplish this, the project has defined three interconnected aims: i) explore the operation of electrocatalysts in liquid NH3, ii) develop molecular and heterogeneous O2 reduction catalysts for operation in liquid NH3, and iii) develop multi-scale modeling and optimization tools to assess the viability of employing NH3 as a fuel cell electrolyte. The approach of using liquid NH3 as electrolyte solvent promises to drastically simplify direct NH3 fuel cell design and operation, but it is untested. The work will entail testing the operation of molecular NH3 oxidation catalysts in liquid ammonia at low temperatures, as well as under pressure. The team will also investigate the feasibility of carrying out the oxygen reduction counter electrode reaction on heterogeneous catalysts in liquid ammonia, which is necessary for the design of full NH3 fuel cells employing liquid NH3 as electrolyte. Finally, the team will demonstrate proof of concept NH3 fuel cells employing liquid NH3 as electrolyte.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although photoactive platinum compounds exist, this research will focus on platinum(IV) species, as they are understudied compared to their platinum(II) counterparts, and the development of this class of compounds may allow greater tunability of photophysical properties for potential use as sensors or devices. A vital component of this work is that it involves the training of undergraduate students and these students will gain proficiency in the practice of science in a contemporary chemistry laboratory. Undergraduate research students are to be involved in all aspects of the work from performing laboratory experiments to writing scientific articles to giving public presentations.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Bard College team will synthesize and characterize cyclometalated Pt-compounds, which are a multifaceted group of compounds with applications in catalysis, sensors, and artificial photosynthetic devices. Photophysical properties of the cyclometalated platinum(IV) compounds will be characterized. Molecular design strategies to improve their properties, including quantum yield and excited-state lifetime, will be evaluated. These strategies include the use of isocyanide ligands and other strong field ligands. A systematic study will increase knowledge about the relationship between metal/ligand combination, and photophysical properties.  Successful studies here have the potential to provide insight on the development of better devices and sensors using photoactive transition metal complexes. The plan is to target compounds that exhibit dual emission or rigidoluminescence (RL). Dual emission plays important roles in sensing and labeling applications, and RL is of interest because rigid media mimic the environment in devices.

Recently it has been found that methane is seeping from the seafloor into the Atlantic Ocean along the Eastern United States. Methane seeps like these may be common along similar coastlines and thus may affect our climate. The reasons for these methane seeps will be studied using geological, chemical, and biological methods.  The project supports students at various levels and contributes to public understanding of the ocean through talks, publications, and videos.  Summer camps designed to inspire the next generation of ocean scientists will be developed. The field work and community outreach will improve our understanding of methane's role in climate and contribute to public understanding of and appreciation for ocean science.<br/><br/>This project will study biogeochemical and geological controls on recently discovered methane seeps in the northern US Atlantic Margin (200-1000m depth). Existing conceptual models of the origin, subsurface migration, characteristics, and history of methane discharge along continental margins would not predict the widespread presence and depth distribution of these seeps. This work will integrate geochemical, microbiological, geophysical, and geological data to investigate the genesis of seep fluids, fluid migration, and methane oxidation processes in a modern seep while reconstructing methane seepage characteristics and gas hydrate stability in the past. The project will combine geophysical characterization with the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry at active seep sites.  This will be combined with gravity and jumbo piston coring from ships as well as targeted sampling using the human occupied deep submergence vehicle ALVIN. This strategy will retrieve multiscale seafloor and sub-seafloor datasets, capturing a record longer than previously recovered at any other seep along this margin. The multi-pronged approach will contribute to an integrated and mechanistic understanding of continental margin methane seeps.<br/><br/> This project is jointly funded by the Directorate for Geoscience?s Chemical Oceanography and Marine Geology and Geophysics programs and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kevin Noonan, Tomasz Kowalewski and Linda Peteanu of Carnegie Mellon University will explore a new class of  optoelectronic macromolecules that spontaneously twists into a spiral or helical shape, not unlike some biological molecules such as proteins or DNA. What makes these novel molecules unique in comparison with their biological counterparts is that electrons forming the backbone bonds are not strictly confined and can transport electrical currents and convert light into electricity or vice versa. The team will use a wide range of characterization techniques to better understand how the precise structure of these molecules makes them adopt the helical shapes, control the way they turn (like right-hand or left-hand screws) and allows them to reversibly unfold/refold under the influence of external conditions.  All these dynamic features will be controlled through precise chemistry and the resulting molecules will be explored as active components for molecular electronics, catalysis, and hierarchical nanomaterials. Since the work is highly interdisciplinary, students participating in this project will develop skill sets in chemical synthesis, molecular/structural analysis, and computational quantum chemistry. In addition, the research team will be active in the local community, working to foster interest and excitement in the molecular sciences.<br/><br/>The project is focused on a family of conjugated helical furan polymers and macrocycles and will advance their synthesis and elucidate their properties as well as self-assembly behavior. The research is prompted by a recent discovery of a powerful structure directing effect of ester side groups in ?-linked alkyl furan-3-carboxylates, which forces adjacent furan repeat units to adopt a syn-conformation and twists the molecules into macrocycles and helical chains. The resulting poly(3-hexylesterfurans) are quite distinct relative to other conjugated helical polymers since they adopt tight helical conformation with only 6.5 repeat units per turn, which effectively turns them into compact, conjugated nanoparticles with a central core void lined with oxygen atoms. Cross-coupling tools will be perfected to allow expansion of this family to other heterocycles and side chain groups with precise control of composition, sequence, and molecular weights. Chiral structure-directing side chains will be used to impart chirality to supramolecular assemblies. The proposed structural and computational studies are directed at elucidating how the precise structure of macrocycles and polymers guides the process of their self-assembly into supramolecular structures. Particular attention will be given to understanding the chain folding process of polymers and the structure-directing effects originating from the presence of chiral groups. Furthermore, chiral polyfurans represent a new addition to the field of chiral conjugated polymers with envisioned unique applications in areas such as chiral electrochemical sensing, electron spin filters, and magneto-optics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This fundamental definition implies that soil thaws at 0C or that ground-ice melts at 0C. However, if salts or salty water are present (saline permafrost), the earth material can thaw or remain unfrozen at temperatures below 0C. Saline permafrost is widespread in the terrestrial arctic environment, occurring across ~35% of the continuous permafrost region. The impacts of warming saline permafrost on natural processes in the Arctic and its reaction to climate change have received little research attention to date. The Thaw Below Zero project is an important next step in studies of permafrost responses to a warming Arctic because saline permafrost is degrading more quickly than other types of permafrost. Knowledge of saline permafrost dynamics in a warming world can better inform earth system models that predict global climate change. Information exchanges with local and regional land management agencies on the effects of warming saline permafrost on natural and human-modified Arctic environments will assist in community resilience and future planning efforts. The project will broaden participation through the inclusion of undergraduate students from I?isa?vik College in Utqia?vik, a graduate student at the University of Wyoming, and an early career female researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. This project addresses policy elements identified in the FY2022-26 Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee Arctic Research Plan related to permafrost and its role in Arctic system interactions as well as risk management and hazard mitigation.<br/><br/>Warming of permafrost across the Northern Hemisphere has been well documented. Since the 1980s, the mean annual temperature of cold, continuous permafrost in northern Alaska has increased by 2-3C. Nevertheless, this region is typically considered to be relatively safe from permafrost degradation since ground temperatures remain well below 0C. However, considering the high ground-ice content in saline soils of the upper permafrost in northern Alaska, we may expect extensive thaw settlement and an increase in landscape change rates because of permafrost warming and thawing at temperatures below 0C. The Thaw Below Zero project will advance fundamentals of permafrost science, contribute to a better understanding of permafrost evolution in a warming Arctic, and provide a basis for predicting climate change impacts on permafrost terrain by clarifying the effect of warming saline permafrost on key natural landscape processes in the Arctic. The project will combine permafrost field studies, laboratory soil testing, geophysical field and laboratory measurements, environmental sensor networks, and remote sensing to (1) study the spatial distribution and properties of saline permafrost; (2) assess how ice wedge formation and subsequent thaw in the Holocene have influenced the depth to and distribution of near-surface saline permafrost; and (3) determine the response of warming saline permafrost below shallow thermokarst lakes. The primary research product of these combined objectives will be the establishment of quantitative relationships between salinity, permafrost characteristics, and Arctic landscape change processes and their rates. Project results will fill fundamental knowledge gaps in the evolution of Arctic permafrost landscapes and provide necessary information for characterizing and understanding future permafrost landscape behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Future heart regeneration relies on mature cardiomyocytes (CMs) from stem cells that will improve heart function when transplanted in the heart. A major problem of the existing stem cell-derived heart tissues is that the cells remain immature, beat more rapidly, and when transplanted into adult failing hearts will eventually provoke lethal arrhythmias. The primary goal of this research is to design and develop an intelligent device that will non-invasively monitor the maturity stage of stem cell-derived CMs in real-time, and adaptively stimulate the cells toward full maturation with electric pulsing and mechanical stretching. The research has the potential to revolutionize the generation of mature CMs. This interdisciplinary collaboration among the New York Institute of Technology, City College of New York, and Rutgers University also plans to increase the participation and retention of underrepresented students in computer science, engineering, and biology and contribute to summer workshops with cutting-edge hands-on activities for local K-12 students.<br/><br/>It was already demonstrated that standard protocols of in-vitro differentiation of cultured human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-CMs without external stimulants yield immature cells. Existing biophysical methods are also incapable of adaptively selecting stimulation parameters based on the current cell state to support the continued cell growth until full maturation. To understand the in-vitro maturation process of hPSC-CMs, this project will develop a data-driven technique and then leverage the gained insights to guide the promotion of cardiomyocyte maturity with unprecedented properties. In particular, a probabilistic graphical model will be designed to evaluate the maturation stage of the hPSC-CMs based on the beating activities recorded online by the electric cell substrate impedance spectroscopy (ECIS) technique. A novel lab-on-chip device, integrating the ECIS sensing and stimulation functions, will monitor the cell maturation process in real-time and apply mechanical and/or electrical stimulation on the hPSC-CMs. The biological stimulation, following the Gsk3 inhibitor and Wnt inhibitor (GiWi) protocol, will remain fixed during the entire differentiation and maturation process. Reinforcement learning techniques will be used to analyze the information obtained from ECIS measurements and select the electrical and mechanical biophysical stimulation strategies. The intelligent iterative adjustment of the stimuli protocol will auto-regulate the device and more efficiently produce mature, beating human cardiac myocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells. The proposed innovative stem cell research will impact a wide range of fields, such as enhancing the applicability of hPSC-CM for disease modeling, drug toxicity screening, tissue engineering, and novel cell-based cardiac therapies. The novel device with stretchable electronics will function in the liquid environment of biological cells and generate new insights into the roles of biophysical stimulations in directing cardiomyocyte stem cell maturation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A significant shift to carbon-free fertilizer production could be on the horizon that would enable feeding the future population of the world using sustainable processes. Musgrave and his research group aims to accelerate this transformation by focusing on the synthesis of ammonia and ammonium nitrate, crucial components of fertilizers, through carbon-neutral electrochemical processes driven by renewable energy. By leveraging cutting-edge quantum chemical computational methods, Musgrave aims to accelerate the discovery and design of novel electrocatalysts that are essential for revolutionizing fertilizer production. Notably, this approach not only aims to enhance fertilizer synthesis but also to reduce nitrate levels, addressing the pressing issue of water contamination in global aquatic systems. Through the meticulous exploration of tens of thousands of candidate catalyst materials, the Musgrave research group aims to discover the key principles that govern the performance of electrocatalysts. This research has the potential to impact a wide array of electrocatalytic processes and will help in educating the future workforce in the increasingly important area of electrocatalysis. <br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to accelerate the electrocatalytic carbon-neutral synthesis of ammonia and ammonium nitrate using renewable energy, with a particular focus on breaking the scaling relations that have long constrained electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction, nitrate reduction, and nitrogen oxidation reactions. To do this, the project will utilize grand canonical density functional theory methods that provide a quantum mechanical description of the electrified interface. This approach was chosen because it enables a fundamental and accurate description of electrochemical processes that occur at the electrocatalyst interface and how these processes change with the applied bias. These studies have the potential to enable a deeper understanding of the intricate processes underlying electrocatalysis. By delving into the electronic structure of electrocatalysts and their response to the applied potential, this research aims to uncover key insights into reaction energetics, relative kinetics, and the potential of unique materials to break scaling relations. The project scope encompasses a diverse range of materials within the binary and Chevrel chemical spaces, with the aim of facilitating the prediction of activity trends across various compositions and potentials. This comprehensive approach is intended to not only shed light on the transferability of scaling principles across different reactions and materials spaces,  but also to inform the development of other electrocatalytic chemistries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These investigations aim at the understanding of their fundamental properties that allowed them to become so important for life. The new compounds prepared also possess properties that suggest their utilization in non-natural applications. For instance, some modified materials are more flexible than their natural counterparts and change their color when deformed. They are therefore suitable to generate materials that can make physical stress visible; this is important for many engineering disciplines. The conversion of carbon dioxide to valuable products is one of the pressing problems of our time. The study of some metal complexes of the modified porphyrins in these conversions expands our understanding how best to do this. These studies will  offer a multidisciplinary and collaborative training ground for students in areas ranging from organic and inorganic synthesis to physical organic chemistry, with exposure to photophysics and a number of biomedical and engineering applications. This will prepare students well for future careers in industry, academia, or public service.<br/><br/>The proposed study focuses on the formal replacement of a pyrrolic building block in porphyrins by stepwise synthetic manipulation of porphyrins. This generates a family of so-called pyrrole-modified porphyrins (PMPs) incorporating one or more non-pyrrolic building blocks. The often dramatic conformational and electronic effects ? especially when the building blocks are larger than the five-membered pyrrole they replace ? are being studied. One focus in these studies is the impact the replacement has on the aromaticity of the PMPs. An appreciation for the chemical transformations taking place within the constraints of a porphyrinic macrocycle assists in the rational design of novel porphyrinoids of utility. The evaluation of select conformationally flexible PMPs in mechanochromic polymers delineates the scopes and limits of utilizing PMPs in the realization of smart materials. Some PMPs suggest their capacity to act as electron sinks. This will be probed by the use of their Co(II) complexes in electro-catalytic multi-electron reductions of carbon dioxide. Success in these endeavors has the potential to provide important long term lessons in porphyrin tuning to build in useful function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research has the potential to revolutionize the generation of mature CMs. This interdisciplinary collaboration among the New York Institute of Technology, City College of New York, and Rutgers University also plans to increase the participation and retention of underrepresented students in computer science, engineering, and biology and contribute to summer workshops with cutting-edge hands-on activities for local K-12 students.<br/><br/>It was already demonstrated that standard protocols of in-vitro differentiation of cultured human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-CMs without external stimulants yield immature cells. Existing biophysical methods are also incapable of adaptively selecting stimulation parameters based on the current cell state to support the continued cell growth until full maturation. To understand the in-vitro maturation process of hPSC-CMs, this project will develop a data-driven technique and then leverage the gained insights to guide the promotion of cardiomyocyte maturity with unprecedented properties. In particular, a probabilistic graphical model will be designed to evaluate the maturation stage of the hPSC-CMs based on the beating activities recorded online by the electric cell substrate impedance spectroscopy (ECIS) technique. A novel lab-on-chip device, integrating the ECIS sensing and stimulation functions, will monitor the cell maturation process in real-time and apply mechanical and/or electrical stimulation on the hPSC-CMs. The biological stimulation, following the Gsk3 inhibitor and Wnt inhibitor (GiWi) protocol, will remain fixed during the entire differentiation and maturation process. Reinforcement learning techniques will be used to analyze the information obtained from ECIS measurements and select the electrical and mechanical biophysical stimulation strategies. The intelligent iterative adjustment of the stimuli protocol will auto-regulate the device and more efficiently produce mature, beating human cardiac myocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells. The proposed innovative stem cell research will impact a wide range of fields, such as enhancing the applicability of hPSC-CM for disease modeling, drug toxicity screening, tissue engineering, and novel cell-based cardiac therapies. The novel device with stretchable electronics will function in the liquid environment of biological cells and generate new insights into the roles of biophysical stimulations in directing cardiomyocyte stem cell maturation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently it has been found that methane is seeping from the seafloor into the Atlantic Ocean along the Eastern United States. Methane seeps like these may be common along similar coastlines and thus may affect our climate. The reasons for these methane seeps will be studied using geological, chemical, and biological methods.  The project supports students at various levels and contributes to public understanding of the ocean through talks, publications, and videos.  Summer camps designed to inspire the next generation of ocean scientists will be developed. The field work and community outreach will improve our understanding of methane's role in climate and contribute to public understanding of and appreciation for ocean science.<br/><br/>This project will study biogeochemical and geological controls on recently discovered methane seeps in the northern US Atlantic Margin (200-1000m depth). Existing conceptual models of the origin, subsurface migration, characteristics, and history of methane discharge along continental margins would not predict the widespread presence and depth distribution of these seeps. This work will integrate geochemical, microbiological, geophysical, and geological data to investigate the genesis of seep fluids, fluid migration, and methane oxidation processes in a modern seep while reconstructing methane seepage characteristics and gas hydrate stability in the past. The project will combine geophysical characterization with the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry at active seep sites.  This will be combined with gravity and jumbo piston coring from ships as well as targeted sampling using the human occupied deep submergence vehicle ALVIN. This strategy will retrieve multiscale seafloor and sub-seafloor datasets, capturing a record longer than previously recovered at any other seep along this margin. The multi-pronged approach will contribute to an integrated and mechanistic understanding of continental margin methane seeps.<br/><br/> This project is jointly funded by the Directorate for Geoscience?s Chemical Oceanography and Marine Geology and Geophysics programs and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Continued development of a sustainable society requires advances in molecular sciences that will pave the way to the solar-powered, efficient, safe and precise molecular engineering of new functional molecules, materials, and fuels. One of the major obstacles on this path stems from the inherent difficulty of extending current chemical theories to accurately describe the complex interplay of matter and energy in light-driven chemical transformations. One of the focal points of the proposed work will be the photogeneration of hydrogen from bio-available precursors like glycerol, sugars, or cellulose. The proposed work aims to discover new chemistries for transforming sunlight into a storable, carbon-neutral fuel. New automated and parallelized research protocols based on newly developed colorimetric hydrogen and oxygen detection methods will create significant sets of data that will be analyzed with modern artificial intelligence methodologies. Such a data-driven approach will allow a substantial acceleration of the research progress. The newly developed tools will use modern manufacturing techniques such as 3D-printing and laser-cutting to significantly lower the cost of these setups and experiments. This approach has the potential to greatly increase the openness for exploring light-driven chemical processes. Research in the Bernhard lab will prepare students at all levels to excel in the multidisciplinary environment common in today's research, while also training them intensely in the areas of transition metal complex synthesis, photocatalysis, and data science. The Bernhard lab involves and trains a diverse group of researchers to accomplish these research tasks. Professor Bernhard and his team will continue to be involved in outreach activities for non-scientists to educate the public on energy issues and instill excitement for science in general.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Bernhard research group will build on their work on the development and use of hydrogen-sensitive film to develop complementary oxygen sensitive films. These films will allow the rapid screening of the progress of hydrogen and oxygen evolving photoreactions on 96-well plates. This technique will allow the team to elaborate on earlier results on the photogeneration of hydrogen from  glycerol as a source of electrons and protons, and now transition to increasingly difficult, but more desirable substrates such as monosaccharides or polysaccharides for this purpose. The multi-well photoreactors will produce large datasets that will not only allow the optimization of reaction conditions more efficiently, but will also establish structure/activity databases that can be explored by physics-inspired machine learning approaches based on quantum mechanical calculations. These experiments will be the foundation for photochemical studies using water as the source of protons and electrons. Gaining a full understanding and an ability to control such water oxidation processes is a requisite step toward the development of a functional water splitting system for producing hydrogen and oxygen concomitantly. The proposed work will culminate in the application of the aforementioned high throughput technology to such water photolysis systems by combining and applying the knowledge gained from the work on each half-reaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dissipation of excessively high levels of heat generated in these applications is a fundamental bottleneck in their practical use. One potential method to resolve this issue is to use boiling of heat transfer fluids, which takes advantage of high energies associated with converting liquid to vapor and the accompanying liquid agitation. However, the current studies on the search for high performance heat transfer fluids rely mainly on empirical trial and error approaches and are focused on the use of refrigerants. The principal aim of this project is to explore the use of microemulsions as the boiling fluid, and to create a rational design framework for microemulsion boiling using an integrated computational and experimental approach. This project plans to study the causes of the enhancement in microemulsion boiling in order to further improve and deploy microemulsions in practical settings. The project will also encompass significant educational and outreach activities, involve minority students and art-in-science displays featuring microemulsion boiling experiments and simulations.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive picture of microemulsion boiling and use that information to design new and improved microemulsions for thermal management applications. It is currently not known why microemulsion boiling exhibits great order and regularity in bubble formation and growth and how bubbles grow to a very large size yet remain attached to the surface and still generate high heat fluxes at the surface. The project seeks to fill this knowledge gap by creating a rational design framework for studying microemulsion boiling based on closely coordinated simulation and experimental efforts.  The simulation effort is focused on deploying leading edge, high accuracy computational methods (both existing and new methods proposed in this project) on a state-of-the-art open-source, massively parallel, GPU enabled continuum scale simulation framework. Experiments will be used to (i) guide the development of new computational methods and physics models, (ii) validate the numerical solver using matched experimental conditions, (iii) prepare new microemulsions with desirable properties suggested by the numerical simulations and (iv) finally validate the predicted enhancement in heat transfer using the new microemulsions. This integrated computational and experimental approach will (i) elucidate new physical mechanisms in microemulsion boiling, (ii) delineate which thermophysical properties of microemulsions need to be tuned for improved thermal performance, and (iii) engineer new microemulsions in the laboratory with desirable thermophysical properties. This approach is expected to yield unprecedented understanding on microemulsion boiling and impact thermal management of electronics/optoelectronics and industrial heat exchanger and distributed heating systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Synthetic polymers or commonly referred to as plastics are widely used in our daily lives.  The properties of these long chain macromolecules consisting of many repeating units linked with carbon-carbon bonds are controlled by their chemical structures which can be tailored for different applications.  In this work, chemically distinct structures are imbedded into polymeric materials. These structures are incorporated into polymer chains at precise locations.  Next, a directed chemical modification acts as a trigger, that upon heating, leads to breakage of the chain. This efficient strategy allows the design of polymer strands with chemical structures that can be pulled apart at one temperature and snapped back together at a different temperature.  The chemistry associated with this award is broadly transferrable to many other polymerization systems and useful to materials chemistry or any other fields in which thermally responsive polymers are of interest.  This research is having a broader impact by providing productive opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in frontline research training and education in organic and polymer chemistry.  Apart from incorporating the results associated with this award into chemistry laboratory courses at the university, an outreach program called the Macromolecular Alliance of Community, Resources and Outreach (MACRO) is initiated.  The goal of this program is to create a depository of outreach materials through which individuals can spread their passion and knowledge of science to the general population. <br/><br/>This work is focused on the development of dynamic-covalent linkages that can be incorporated into polymer systems to enable switchability in polymer topology and composition and bestow thermal responsive properties.  Several studies will be carried out to achieve this goal.  The first objective focuses on the development of Diels-Alder linkage systems with novel dienes and dienophiles and systematic understanding of the thermal stability of the prepared adducts.  In the second objective, the unsaturated adducts are to undergo 1,4-addition or conjugate addition leading to adducts that are more susceptible to retro-Diels-Alder cleavage.  Next these Diels-Alder linkages are to be incorporated within polymeric structures using copper-catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), copper-mediate azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry and urethane-based strategies. The last aim will explore dynamic covalent chemistry effects on the polymer topology and physical properties with special emphasis on polymer processing for re/up-cycling of materials. Using nucleophiles such as thiols to modulate bond-cleaving temperature is applicable to a variety of other polymerization techniques and has the potential to generate a wide range of new smart materials of industrial importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The RSA achieves this reduction in costly antenna components by sharing them between active antenna locations selected through fast RF switching. Cognitive sensing using RSA emulates the perception-action cycle (PAC) of cognitive processes. RSA gathers real-time data from different spatial antenna locations, perceives surroundings, and dynamically adapts antenna locations and subsequent array processing, known as beamforming. Given that active antenna locations can change depending on desired source and interference directions and other parameters, this work addresses three main challenges specific to array reconfigurability: frequent and complex antenna switching, computing optimum active array structures, and implementing beamforming within the fast PAC. Overcoming these challenges requires fast iterative optimization algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as offline deep learning (DL)-based neural network training, and enforcement  of simplified antenna switching criteria. The RSA design is explored for two key applications: spectral sensing (SS) in cognitive radio (CR) and localization and tracking in cognitive radar sensing. Enabled by SS functionality, a CR detects underutilized frequency bands for opportunistic use and autonomously classifies RF signals. Integrating RSA design within CR enhances interference mitigation, improving service quality, bandwidth availability, and spectrum utilization. These advantages benefit regulatory authorities and government entities by enhancing situational awareness, surveillance capabilities, spectrum management, and coexistence measures. While CR typically relies on passive or receive-only sensing, an RSA-enabled cognitive radar system enhances performance by optimizing antenna locations at both the transmitter and receiver, albeit through distinct approaches. This advancement would propel state-of-the-art weather monitoring, military radar, radar for self-driving cars, indoor human activity classification, fall detection, and remote vital sign estimation.<br/><br/>The proposed research is predicated on developing fast iterative algorithms, including DL techniques, to enable dynamic interference suppression by swiftly and intelligently selecting subsets of antennas from a uniform grid of antenna locations. Current algorithms are effective only under severely limited scenarios: the assumed prior knowledge of the operating environment is often unknown, and real-time reconfigurability is a considerable challenge due to the high run times of optimizing the array topology. The proposed research aims to transform the current paradigms for SS and signal modulation classification via two novel ideas: (i) the adoption of multi-band RSA in CR as a mechanism to enhance source ID classification across a range of frequency bands while considering realistic channel impairments, and (ii) the optimization of RSA for multi-band sensing by including advances in machine learning and convex optimization. The design of DL models is expected to process multiple frequency bands of interest in a unifying framework. The proposal integrates data-dependent techniques and prior environment knowledge into DL models, resulting in novel architectures with greater accuracy that will advance adaptive sensing by overcoming bottlenecks specific to data-dependent implementation. The proposed research would advance the performance of radar sensing by (i) efficiently solving high-resolution RSA multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) radar formulation for generating exceptionally accurate receive beampatterns that are robust to unknown jamming and clutter environments, and (ii) training DL models through solving complex optimization problems, to realize an end-to-end transmitter design to predict transmit antenna locations, as well as transmit waveforms for maximizing the power towards target locations. Since radar sensing capability is limited due to various environmental factors such as noise, clutter, and jamming signals, this proposal offers a promising solution as it involves integrating RSA into MIMO radar tracking to bolster interference rejection capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This fundamental definition implies that soil thaws at 0C or that ground-ice melts at 0C. However, if salts or salty water are present (saline permafrost), the earth material can thaw or remain unfrozen at temperatures below 0C. Saline permafrost is widespread in the terrestrial arctic environment, occurring across ~35% of the continuous permafrost region. The impacts of warming saline permafrost on natural processes in the Arctic and its reaction to climate change have received little research attention to date. The Thaw Below Zero project is an important next step in studies of permafrost responses to a warming Arctic because saline permafrost is degrading more quickly than other types of permafrost. Knowledge of saline permafrost dynamics in a warming world can better inform earth system models that predict global climate change. Information exchanges with local and regional land management agencies on the effects of warming saline permafrost on natural and human-modified Arctic environments will assist in community resilience and future planning efforts.

This project addresses policy elements identified in the FY2022-26 Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee Arctic Research Plan related to permafrost and its role in Arctic system interactions as well as risk management and hazard mitigation.<br/><br/>Warming of permafrost across the Northern Hemisphere has been well documented. Since the 1980s, the mean annual temperature of cold, continuous permafrost in northern Alaska has increased by 2-3C. Nevertheless, this region is typically considered to be relatively safe from permafrost degradation since ground temperatures remain well below 0C. However, considering the high ground-ice content in saline soils of the upper permafrost in northern Alaska, we may expect extensive thaw settlement and an increase in landscape change rates because of permafrost warming and thawing at temperatures below 0C. The Thaw Below Zero project will advance fundamentals of permafrost science, contribute to a better understanding of permafrost evolution in a warming Arctic, and provide a basis for predicting climate change impacts on permafrost terrain by clarifying the effect of warming saline permafrost on key natural landscape processes in the Arctic. The project will combine permafrost field studies, laboratory soil testing, geophysical field and laboratory measurements, environmental sensor networks, and remote sensing to (1) study the spatial distribution and properties of saline permafrost; (2) assess how ice wedge formation and subsequent thaw in the Holocene have influenced the depth to and distribution of near-surface saline permafrost; and (3) determine the response of warming saline permafrost below shallow thermokarst lakes. The primary research product of these combined objectives will be the establishment of quantitative relationships between salinity, permafrost characteristics, and Arctic landscape change processes and their rates. Project results will fill fundamental knowledge gaps in the evolution of Arctic permafrost landscapes and provide necessary information for characterizing and understanding future permafrost landscape behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The manufacturing process of LIBs involves assembling key components such as the positive, negative electrode, separator, and electrolyte, followed by a critical formation process. During formation, the battery undergoes charge and discharge cycles to develop the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the negative electrode, crucial for battery performance. However, this formation process is time-consuming, particularly in large-scale production lines where it adds significantly to overall manufacturing costs. Understanding and optimizing the formation process to reduce time while ensuring quality and performance is essential for making LIBs more economically viable. This project aims to revolutionize the way LIBs are formed and manufactured by embedding advanced optical sensors directly into the batteries. The PI and collaborators hope to gain real-time insights into the formation process focusing on SEI formation. Understanding SEI formation better could lead to more efficient battery production, improved performance, and increased safety. Additionally, this research could pave the way for smarter battery management systems, optimizing energy usage and enabling seamless integration with renewable energy sources and smart grids. Ultimately, the project aims to create more sustainable and resilient energy solutions for the future, benefiting both industry and society as a whole. Funding from the NSF would support this innovative research endeavor, driving advancements in battery technology and fostering a skilled workforce for tomorrow's challenges. It not only offers opportunities for educational enrichment and diversity through hands-on learning experiences in STEM fields but also promise societal benefits such as enabling sustainable energy solutions and reducing reliance on fossil.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to enhance our understanding of LIB formation processes through the integration of advanced optical sensing technologies, particularly focusing on the dynamic evolution of the SEI layer during battery formation. Specifically, the research will utilize silicon Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors to differentiate between temperature fluctuations and electrochemo-mechanical stresses during battery formation. These sensors will be embedded directly within the battery structure, allowing for in-situ monitoring of temperature and strain variations. By correlating sensor outputs with battery behavior metrics and developing optimization strategies for formation processes, the project aims to streamline LIB manufacturing and improve battery performance and efficiency. The project's technical approach involves the fabrication and integration of the optical sensors into LIBs, followed by comprehensive testing and analysis to monitor SEI formation in real-time. The silicon FPI will excel in high-resolution temperature measurement, while the FBG will provide accurate insight into electrochemo-mechanical stresses. By subtracting temperature signals obtained from the FPI, the research will effectively disentangle temperature fluctuations from stress/strain variations encountered during battery formation and cycling. This innovative approach not only offers a non-invasive solution for internal, real-time monitoring of LIBs but also holds the potential to advance the field of battery science and engineering. The project's intellectual significance lies in its potential to deepen our understanding of LIB formation processes, foster collaboration across disciplines, and pave the way for more efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions, benefiting both industry and society at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Attracting STEM majors and specialists to teaching careers has long been challenging, and low retention rates make this problem more difficult. WISER3 intends to address these issues by focusing on relationships and community among STEM educators. The project provides early professional experiences for STEM majors to explore content-specific research and STEM careers so that they connect with professionals in their field, including teachers. Scholarships support STEM majors who pursue teacher certification through a program enhanced by pairing student teachers and incorporating cross-cohort mentoring groups. Scholars participate in a systemic and data-informed approach to STEM educator recruitment that spans P-12 and university-level audiences. Support beyond the preparation program continues through cross-cohort mentoring in the early years of a scholar?s teaching career. These components intend to attract STEM majors to the teaching field and increase STEM educator retention rates by developing an enduring support community.<br/><br/>This project at Winthrop University (WU) includes partnerships with Clinton College (a nearby HBCU) and three local high-need school districts: Chester County, York District 1, and Rock Hill Schools (York District 3). Project goals include increasing participation in WU?s STEM education programs; ensuring WISER3 scholars are effective classroom teachers; retaining these STEM educators in high-need schools in the partner districts; enhancing mentoring supports through near-peer and cross-cohort design that spans the preparation program and continues through induction years; and implementing community-building components through regular professional development and social events. Across the five-year funding period, WISER3 will produce 42 new STEM educators through scholarships for high-achieving students to obtain teacher certification through a Master of Arts in Teaching degree. Among these, six will be recruited from biology majors at the Clinton College. The remaining 36 will be WU students with majors in biology, chemistry, or mathematics. The project has the potential to contribute additional research insights on implementing (a) paired placements in field and clinical experiences and (b) cross-cohort mentoring. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Recently it has been found that methane is seeping from the seafloor into the Atlantic Ocean along the Eastern United States. Methane seeps like these may be common along similar coastlines and thus may affect our climate. The reasons for these methane seeps will be studied using geological, chemical, and biological methods.  The project supports students at various levels and contributes to public understanding of the ocean through talks, publications, and videos.  Summer camps designed to inspire the next generation of ocean scientists will be developed. The field work and community outreach will improve our understanding of methane's role in climate and contribute to public understanding of and appreciation for ocean science.<br/><br/>This project will study biogeochemical and geological controls on recently discovered methane seeps in the northern US Atlantic Margin (200-1000m depth). Existing conceptual models of the origin, subsurface migration, characteristics, and history of methane discharge along continental margins would not predict the widespread presence and depth distribution of these seeps. This work will integrate geochemical, microbiological, geophysical, and geological data to investigate the genesis of seep fluids, fluid migration, and methane oxidation processes in a modern seep while reconstructing methane seepage characteristics and gas hydrate stability in the past. The project will combine geophysical characterization with the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry at active seep sites.  This will be combined with gravity and jumbo piston coring from ships as well as targeted sampling using the human occupied deep submergence vehicle ALVIN. This strategy will retrieve multiscale seafloor and sub-seafloor datasets, capturing a record longer than previously recovered at any other seep along this margin. The multi-pronged approach will contribute to an integrated and mechanistic understanding of continental margin methane seeps.<br/><br/> This project is jointly funded by the Directorate for Geoscience?s Chemical Oceanography and Marine Geology and Geophysics programs and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biorefineries show promise for renewably converting biomass to biofuels and chemicals; however, significant inefficiencies are present, as the wastewater streams have high concentrations of dissolved oxygenated hydrocarbons. Aqueous phase reforming (APR) offers a solution by converting these wastewater streams into renewable hydrogen with catalysts. Traditional catalysts display poor APR performance due to strong, nanoscale chemical interactions between different biomass-based chemicals at the interface between the catalyst surface and the wastewater stream. To accelerate the development of high performing APR catalysts, the project  will connect experimentally controllable conditions, such as the composition and temperature, to the structure and reactivity of catalytic interfaces. This will be achieved by investigating the nanoscale interactions between a series of biomass-based molecules at a platinum-water interface. Furthermore, the project will enhance science and engineering education by applying virtual reality to enable students to visualize molecular systems at the nanoscale and connect their observations to macroscale chemical properties. <br/><br/>Despite APR's potential, studies often overlook the multi-component nature of real biomass-based feedstocks, leading to suboptimal catalyst performance. Leveraging multiscale computational modeling and experimental collaboration, the project will provide insights regarding the interplay between aqueous phase properties and solid-liquid catalytic interfaces. Specifically, the project focuses on characterizing the competitive adsorption and potential energy surface for decomposition of binary carboxylic acid mixtures at a platinum-water interface. Experimentally controllable conditions (i.e., composition and temperature) will be connected to the structure and reactivity of the platinum-water interface via a combination of atomic-scale electronic calculations (i.e. density functional theory) and force field molecular dynamics simulations.  Insights gained will inform the design of deactivation-resistant APR catalysts and advance understanding of competitive adsorption and catalytic reactions at complex interfaces.

Adult worms infiltrate the lymphatic system, causing swelling, while worm offspring circulate in the blood. While some treatments effectively kill worm offspring, it is more difficult to kill adult worms and thoroughly treat the disease because of their location within the lymphatic system. This project will help to address this gap by employing tiny, lipid-based sacs called liposomes to deliver lymphatic filariasis drugs to the lymphatic system more effectively after oral administration. This work will investigate how changing liposome characteristics affects both drug access to lymph and the killing of adult filarial worms, resulting in a more effective application of existing lymphatic filariasis drugs. Undergraduate students will be heavily involved in executing this project, providing valuable research experiences. This research will additionally be paired with the development of laboratory activities on topics like cell culture methods, nanomaterials, and analysis tools for implementation in undergraduate engineering courses. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop a drug delivery platform for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis that optimizes lymphatic drug uptake from the intestinal lumen and increases adult filarial worm killing to improve the efficacy of lymphatic filariasis therapy.

Nanoclusters represent an important class of nanomaterials, serving as the foundations of nanotechnology. To date, metal nanoclusters have been made and purified in solution, typically are transferred to a solid conductive support for their use, and examined by expensive methods that are time-consuming and operated by highly trained users. The Zamborini group proposes to controllably make metal nanoclusters directly on a conductive support in pure form and examine them by their recently developed method, which is simple, economical and efficient. Commonly made metal nanoclusters have a wide distribution in the number of atoms in the nanocluster, but this work aims to make nanoclusters with the same size and same number of atoms.  This would allow the group to better understand and tailor their properties for a specific use. One application is for catalyzing chemical reactions that are important in the chemical industry and in renewable energy strategies, such as would be deployed in developing batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers, and solar cells.  This research will provide interdisciplinary research training to undergraduate and graduate students on an exciting material to prepare them for careers in nanotechnology. The Zamborini  group will promote science to high school and middle school students through online and in person events to share the excitement science with these students.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Zamborini research group of the University of Louisville will use electrochemistry for synthesizing, characterizing, and patterning a unique class of materials known as atomically-precise nanoclusters (APNCs), which are clusters of metal containing fewer than 200 atoms bonded with ligand stabilizers.  Their fundamental properties and reactivity can be fine-tuned by controlling the number of atoms and type of atoms in the APNCs, including alloys.  To date, they have been synthesized and purified in solution and characterized by expensive methods such as electron microscopy, mass spectrometry, and x-ray spectroscopy.  The Zamborini group will electrodeposit APNCs of controlled size from metal ions in the presence of phosphine and phosphonium ligands by controlling the nucleation density and the stabilizer/metal ion ratio.  They will add other metals controllable by antigalvanic replacement reactions.  This will lead to a high coverage of metal/alloy APNCs on the electrode surface that will be characterized for size, coverage, and composition by electrochemistry, which is very simple, low cost, and high throughput.  This will improve fundamental understanding of their properties for potential use in industrial processes and renewable energy strategies.  The Zamborini group will also develop a hydrogel scanning probe tip to controllably pattern APNCs and nanoparticles on electrodes by electrodeposition within a nanoscale gel.  If successful, these studies will enhance understanding of electrochemistry within nanoscale hydrogels and the properties of patterned nanostructures for applications in catalysis and sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Doyle at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)  is studying chemical reactions that use visible light as an energy source to transform readily available starting materials to more valuable products of potential utility in medicinal, agrochemical and polymer chemistry. Because most organic molecules do not absorb visible light, a catalyst is necessary. In this project, the Doyle team is designing visible light-absorbing catalysts that enable us to access versatile, high energy intermediates known as carbocations and carbanions. Previously, these intermediates were only accessible using harsh reaction conditions, such as at high temperatures and/or corrosive reagents. The use of such conditions makes it challenging to incorporate sensitive functional groups into the precursors, thus limiting the molecules that can be used in the chemistry. In contrast, the Doyle group?s approach to these intermediates allows for access to and manipulation of more highly functionalized and sensitive precursors. To best explore this science, Professor Doyle and her team are integrating modern data science techniques into the workflow for catalyst design, reaction optimization, and advancing scientific understanding. As such, this project is providing a diverse group of chemistry Ph.D. students and undergraduates with the interdisciplinary training and broadened skill sets that are becoming increasingly necessary to contribute to the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workforce. Dr. Doyle and her coworkers engage in an extensive range of educational and outreach activities, including co-writing monthly ?diversity highlights? for UCLA chemistry?s weekly departmental newsletter, delivering educational chemistry table demos through StemPrep for local elementary school students who belong to groups underrepresented in STEM, and partnering with local community colleges to host summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) students.<br/><br/>Under this award, the team led by Professor Abigail G. Doyle at UCLA is developing synthetic reactions that access high-energy, polar reactive intermediates using visible-light and photocatalysts. Carbocations and carbanions are valuable reactive intermediates for a broad range of synthetic strategies. However, the generation of these intermediates typically requires strong acid or base, strong oxidants or reductants, or high temperatures, only affords access to stabilized intermediates, and/or requires the use of precursors that are prepared in multiple synthetic steps from feedstock chemicals. These restrictions preclude the application of carbocations or carbanions in late stage synthesis and limit the ability to access a number of desirable but relatively sensitive motifs. This program is addressing these challenges by using photocatalytic radical-polar crossover to access carbocations or carbanions under mild and selective conditions from abundant and stable C(sp3)?H, carboxylic acid and alcohol precursors. The Doyle team is developing a mechanistically novel desaturation reaction that features complementary site selectivity, enantioselective C(sp3)?H oxidation reactions using a data-science guided catalyst discovery and optimization workflow, a platform for the synthesis of esters by chemoselective cross-coupling of two carboxylic acids, and a catalytic direct deoxygenative alkylation reaction of alcohols. These strategies will be vetted in the context of the synthesis of functional molecules of potential utility in medicinal, agrochemical and polymer chemistry. Moreover, these studies aim to uncover mechanistic understanding that will advance fundamental knowledge of visible-light promoted chemical reactions and the application of data science tools in catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simple C*-algebras are those that cannot be broken apart into smaller (""simpler"") C*-algebras. The largest part of this project is about when a simple C*-algebra is isomorphic to its opposite algebra, that is, mathematically the same as what might be thought of as its mirror image. For an example from everyday life, an ordinary sock is the same as its mirror image, since a sock which fits on a right foot will fit equally well on the left foot. A glove isn't like that: whatever one does, a right glove will not fit on a left hand. A nonsimple C*-algebra can be made of very elementary parts, but put together in a tricky way, so as to not be isomorphic to its opposite. Simple C*-algebras which are not separable or not nuclear (""too large"", but in different senses) can also fail to be isomorphic to their opposites. On the other hand, simple C*-algebras covered by the Elliott classification program are isomorphic to their opposites. A long-term goal of the project is to exhibit a simple separable nuclear C*-algebra which is not isomorphic to its opposite. Such an algebra could not be covered even by any proposed expansion of the Elliott program. The project will also contribute to US workforce development through the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The intended example is a simple unital AH algebra with fast dimension growth. The intended proof that it is not isomorphic to its opposite depends on nonexistence theorems for certain homomorphisms from one matrix algebra over the algebra of continuous functions on a compact space to a different matrix algebra over the continuous functions on a different compact space. When the second matrix size is large enough, all homomorphisms not ruled out for fairly obvious reasons actually exist. When it is small, known obstructions rule out most homomorphisms. The application requires information about an intermediate range. Here, even the simplest case, asked by Blackadar over 30 years ago, remains open; understanding this case is a necessary preliminary step. This case can almost certainly be settled by computations in rational homotopy theory, a new use of algebraic topology in C*-algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Batteries are the most common solution, but they have multiple downsides, such as short lifetime, low performance at low temperatures, and high fire/explosion hazard risks. New generation supercapacitors are promising candidates owing to their light weight, fast charging, safe use, and non-toxic content. Supercapacitors are expected to satisfy high energy needs as well (to replace batteries) and their market size is expected to increase four times over the next six years. However, the thermal behavior of new generation nanoporous supercapacitors designed to work at high potentials is not well understood, hindering their potential use. This project will investigate the temperature influence to make supercapacitors more reliable and support their transformation for future needs. In parallel, educational activities will create nanotechnology awareness in a wide range of education levels to attract students to the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) related professions to support future workforces especially from underrepresented groups from Chattanooga-area schools.<br/><br/>Electric double-layer (EDL) capacitor (EDLC) is a promising technology to store energy since the electrode/electrolyte interface holds a large electric potential difference at a very small distance. This creates the main advantage of EDLCs, but also makes accurate calculations very challenging. The EDL formation as well as transfer of built-up heat shows non-continuum behavior since molecular level mechanisms are dominant at nano-levels. Using molecular dynamics, the project will provide the true characterization of coupled behavior of EDL formation and nanoscale heat transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The overall objective of this project is to describe capacitance of new water-in-salt electrolytes with porous graphene as a function of structural and temperature conditions. The project will use molecular-level modeling to explore the behavior of  the electrode/electrolyte systems. Goals are to describe (i) the heat transfer through electrolyte domain and electrolyte/electrode interface, (ii) the ionic distributions as a function of resulting temperatures, and (iii) the differential capacitance at corresponding working conditions.

The pores will be precisely defined with chemical groups that will be used to control the function of the molecules. This research seeks to understand how changing three parameters will influence the helical shape of the molecule: (i) the charge state of the molecule, (ii) attaching large groups to the exterior of the molecule, and (iii) changing the functional groups on the molecule. This work aims to produce water soluble molecules that bind tightly to negatively charged species and discover ways to switch between helical shapes using external stimulus like light.  Knowledge to be gained from this research may inform the design of materials for molecular recognition with applications in sensing, separation science, and environmental remediation. In addition to the research training of graduate and undergraduate students, including members of underrepresented groups, this project will maintain a collaboration with a local high school science teachers to develop new methods of crystallization and incorporate crystallography into local high school science classes.

Many of the catalytic processes by which fuels and commodity chemicals are produced proceed through transition metal hydride complexes. Therefore, routes to synthesize transition metal hydrides with light provide a sustainable route for fuel and chemical synthesis. The research activities will contribute to the development of a globally competitive science and technology workforce as trainees will develop skills in chemical synthesis and spectroscopy. Complementary activities led by Professor Dempsey aim to broaden participation of historically marginalized communities in science and to train a globally competitive workforce. Professor Dempsey leads the Chemistry Women Mentorship Network, which connects graduate students and postdoc women interested in academic careers with faculty mentors and designs resources to support successful mentor-mentee relationships. Professor Dempsey also leads a three-day workshop that provides hands-on training in both theoretical and practical aspects of electrochemistry to researchers around the country. <br/><br/>The generation of transition metal hydride complexes using light would enable approaches that employ solar energy to drive these important, energy-intensive reactions. The excited-state proton-coupled electron transfer reactivity of transition metal complexes with ligand-to-metal charge transfer excited states has not yet been established, but is a promising strategy for integrating light capture and proton-electron reactivity. Under this award, foundational studies of coordination complexes with ligand-to-metal charge transfer excited states that combine synthesis, spectroscopy, and theory will be undertaken to establish the electronic structure factors necessary for low energy ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions. Subsequently, photochemistry accessible from ligand-to-metal charge transfer excited states will be investigated, with a focus on demonstrating the scope of excited-state electron and proton transfer reactions accessible. Structure-function relationships and time-resolved spectroscopy will be instrumental in gaining new insight to photochemistry from these excited states. This knowledge will guide the investigation of unprecedented proton-coupled electron transfer reactions from complexes with ligand-to-metal charge transfer excited states. Spectroscopy and theory will provide key insight to the electronic structure properties that engender proton-coupled electron transfer reactivity.

Goicoechea of Indiana University will study a new class of molecules and solids derived from diatomic analogs of cyanide. Cyanide is found across many areas of chemistry, ranging from biological enzyme cofactors to custom-made magnetic materials and catalysts. Cyanide salts are routinely used in applications including bulk chemical synthesis, electroplating, metallurgy, and as fumigants and insecticides. By contrast, the chemistry of the heavier phosphorus- and arsenic-containing ions, the cyaphide and cyarside ions, respectively, is unexplored despite the enormous potential they offer for the synthesis of interesting magnetic materials. This proposal will explore the synthesis of several molecular targets that will offer insight into the electronic structure and properties of these new chemical building blocks. Ultimately, this will prove critical for their use in the design of an entirely new family of molecules and coordination polymers that are currently absent in the chemical literature. Student research training (undergraduates, high school and graduate students) and student mentoring are important components of the project, as is the creation of a public-facing internet educational resource for the project.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this proposal is to develop novel organometallic compounds containing cyaphide (CP) and cyarside (CAs) ligands for the transfer of these functional groups through metathesis and cross-coupling reactions. Proof-of-concept research by the Goicoechea group suggests that such species are isolable, and that reagents containing these new ions can be made to transfer these reactive groups to metal centers using simple salt-metathesis reaction protocols.  Obtaining organic and transition metal complexes with these CP and CAs groups will allow for comparisons of their molecular structures and chemical reactivities with analogous complexes containing the more common cyanide (CN) functional group. The experimental components of the project will be complemented with and guided by computational chemistry. With these species in hand, the research team will explore the synthesis of multi-metallic compounds with bridging CP/CAs groups to understand how these ions can be used to enhance magnetic communication between metal centers in oligomeric, polymeric and ultimately two- and three-dimensional extended solids. The synthetic protocols that will be developed will ultimately allow access to a new family of coordination compounds related to Prussian blue, a class of solids that have applications in numerous technologically relevant areas, including magnetism, sensing, catalysis, and energy storage. On a longer time scale, such discoveries are expected to benefit a broad range of researchers, particularly those working in materials science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mutation is the ultimate source of variation but surprisingly variation in mutation rates is poorly understood. This research will take advantage of advances in genomic screening to examine what are the causes, rates, and types of mutation that occur naturally using a direct, experimental approach.

Existing powder characterization methods are reported to have limited applications in additive manufacturing. This is because they do not directly address powder spreadability, a critical but not well understood metric. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project aims to fill this research gap by designing a testbed to better define and measure powder spreadability. Novel measurement methods, which determine the three-dimensional topography of spread powder layers, will be developed and advanced data processing solutions will be used to distill these complex measurements into easily interpreted summary metrics that directly imply powder quality and suitability for the additive manufacturing process. If successful, the researched testbed and metrics can facilitate the monitoring of the powder spreadability for virgin powder supplies as well as re-used and recycled powder. The expected outcomes will have a significant impact on the quality testing methods used in the standard communities and manufacturing industry. <br/><br/>Spreadability is a poorly understood characteristic of powder which may lead to heterogeneity in the powder bed and thus lack of fusion in manufactured components. This correlation has been difficult to establish without a rigorous study of spreadability and supporting methodology for measuring the property of spreadability. The objective of work associated with this project is to interrogate the physics of powder spreading to define the main process variables and their influences on spreading behavior. Spreadability will be quantified via summary metrics derived from the physical topography of the formed powder bed via adapted surface texture analysis methods. A novel experimental test bed employing fringe projection profilometry to measure powder bed topography will be utilized. This will overcome existing limitations of powder characterization methods that were developed for powder metallurgy, not additive manufacturing. A screening experimental design will be applied to identify critical process variables and determine the most effective measures of spreadability. Research results will support the future development of standardized quality testing procedures for metal powder feedstocks that will promote overall process control and the wider adoption of laser powder bed fusion.

The overall goal is to advance more sustainable, carbon-based photocatalyst scaffolds that will reduce cost and overall environmental impact compared to traditional precious metal-based systems. The study includes the synthesis and study of new catalyst scaffolds, with the goal of advancing fundamental knowledge about how modifications affect reactivity.

Secondly, it is proposed that extended TTz photocatalyst materials will enable lower energy (e.g. red light) driven transformations while helping to tune redox characteristics for specific transformations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the ability of a series of TTzs to drive reactions with much higher efficiencies than previously used transition metal photocatalysts. The collaborative team will further explore photocatalyst stability, reaction rates, and ability to drive a range of organic transformations. A library of new TTz photocatalyst derivatives will be developed with tunable light absorption properties and redox characteristics. Photochemical studies will be carried out to establish reaction quantum yields, and rates will be monitored using fluorescence and chromogenic TTz coloration changes.

Importantly, the project addresses two major issues facing the region: 1) opportunities for careers right after graduation from high school, and 2) career advancement and retraining for incumbent workers. Project activities include 1) the development of a long-term recruitment plan to foster diversity in the program, workplace, and the field; 2) the development of new and revised curriculum for an automation technology program; 3) the creation of a set of one-credit hour courses and open lab sessions in collaboration with industry; 4) the establishment of an industry advisory council to ensure continuous updating of materials and resources per industry standards; and 5) the advancement of  knowledge on providing educational opportunities, materials, and resources for traditional and non-traditional students.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to meet local industry need for skilled automation technicians. The project will (a) collaborate with local industries to develop a flexible curriculum based on industry input and standards that prepares students/workers; (b) implement effective open lab operations and processes; and (c) create a long-term recruitment plan that will build relations with local high schools and enable students to work with tools and automation starting at a young age, as well as recruiting incumbent workers who are seeking up-skilling opportunities. The mixed methods evaluation is guided by a set of questions that are aligned with the goals, objectives, and activities of the project and that is specifically designed to document and assess both implementation (process) and outcomes. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most important industrial processes is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia ? the basis of nearly all nitrogen fertilizers. This is accomplished by the Haber Bosch (HB) process that is efficient but requires high temperatures and pressures. The HB process is carried out using petroleum and contributes about 2% of the worldwide carbon emissions. Chemists have spent over a hundred years trying to develop alternatives to the HB process that can operate at room temperature/pressure. This project will facilitate these reactions using catalysts based on metals that have not normally been applied to this application. During the project students will be trained in this vital field and will include members of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Metalacyclic phenolate complexes of a variety of electropositive and Lewis acidic metals from the s, d, and f-block will be synthesized and their reductive small molecule activation chemistry will be evaluated. The ligands will be functionalized to enable the isolation of small and soluble dilanthanide complexes that can be crystallized and studied. Correlations with size, Lewis acidity, and one-electron redox potentials will be investigated. Open-faced complexes will make complicated dinitrogen functionalization reactivity amenable to study and will offer the opportunity to study s-block reductive activation chemistry with greater ease. Throughout the studies, a range of spectroscopic techniques will be employed to understand the path of electron flow from the source of reducing electrons to the dinitrogen molecule that activated by the electropositive metal center(s). The studies will aid our understanding of how electropositive base metals, which would not normally be able to bind or add electrons to dinitrogen, are able to support its conversion to amines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These mathematical equations model a wide range of physical phenomena arising in fluid dynamics (oceanography), quantum mechanics, plasma physics, nonlinear optics, and general relativity. The equations being studied range from semilinear to fully nonlinear, and from local to nonlocal equations, and we aim to investigate them in an optimal fashion both locally and globally in time. This research develops and connects ideas and methods in partial differential equations, and in some cases also draws a clear path towards other problems in fields such as geometry, harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and microlocal analysis. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The strength of the nonlinear wave interactions is the common feature in the models considered in this proposal, and it significantly impacts both their short-time and their long-time behavior. The project addresses a series of very interesting questions concerning several classes of nonlinear dispersive equations: (i) short-time existence theory in a low regularity setting; (ii) breakdown of waves, and here a particular class of equations is provided by the water wave models; and (iii) long-time persistence and/or dispersion and decay of waves, which would involve either a qualitative aspect attached to it, that is, an asymptotic description of the nonlinear solution, or a quantitative description of it, for instance nontraditional scattering statements providing global in time dispersive bounds. All of this also depends strongly on the initial data properties, such as size, regularity and localization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contamination of groundwater, originating from industrial and agricultural activities, has raised concerns over the potential risks to the environment and public health. The proposed work aims to develop a novel approach that will improve our fundamental understanding of contaminant transport mechanisms in the subsurface environment. More specifically, the researchers will utilize this framework to shed novel insights into how the spatial structure of the subsurface geologic formation interacts with the large-scale spreading behavior of the contaminant plume. Such insights are fundamental to predicting the risks associated with groundwater contamination, and to define optimal contaminant remediation strategies. These predictions can help keep groundwater resources sustainable. The proposed approach makes use of machine-learning algorithms and computer models that will enhance our ability to manage contaminated groundwater resources. Furthermore, a set of educational activities for middle school, undergraduate, and graduate students is proposed. The researchers highlight a novel educational game that aims to show undergraduate students the role of the geologic structure in groundwater contaminant movement. <br/><br/><br/>The proposed work consists of the development of a hybrid computational framework that combines the benefits of physics-based models and data-driven methods in order to enhance our understanding of the relationship between the heterogeneous structure of the geologic formation and the overall spreading of the solute plume.

The proposed computational framework will efficiently estimate dispersion coefficients and identify the governing equation for the solute concentration field in macroscopically heterogeneous porous media for which the representative elementary volume is on the order of the system?s size.

The primary focus will be on systems utilizing cobalt?porphyrin complexes as deactivators. Guided by mechanistic and kinetic insights, modifications to the porphyrin ligands, linkers between the two metallic centers, and the ligands that chelate rare earth metals are expected to facilitate the development of stereocontrolled radical polymerization with expanded substrate scope, reduced catalyst loading, improved control and livingness, and compatibility with aqueous reaction media. The knowledge gained is expected to further contribute to the development of metal-free stereocontrolled systems employing chiral Lewis acids and organocatalytic reversible-deactivation chemistry.

Bipedal robots hold promise for expanding the scope of tasks on the Moon due to their unique locomotion capabilities. Because of their human-like structure, a bipedal robot can also mimic some of the movements and actions of astronauts, allowing for better testing of equipment and procedures for humans. However, the challenges of lunar gravity and the presence of fine surface?s dust pose stability challenges for these robots. This award seeks to fund research that attempts to gain a fundamental understanding of lunar bipedal locomotion mechanics and design robust and energy-efficient devices for bipedal robot locomotion on the Moon by using reinforcement learning. This work has significant potential to impact applications on challenging terrain on Earth and has a translational impact on improving human locomotion strategies on the Moon. This will lead, in turn, to better mission planning and increased astronaut safety. This research project will contribute to build and improve the robotics curriculum at Michigan Technological University while engaging diverse groups, including low-income, first-generation, and/or underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students, high school students, in robotics education and research.<br/><br/>The research goal of the project is to leverage dynamic modeling, control theory, hybrid systems, and reinforcement learning to advance biped robot locomotion on the Moon. To achieve this goal, three research objectives will be pursued: i) improving the understanding of lunar biped locomotion mechanics by using both abstraction and detailed models; ii) investigating robust and energetically efficient biped locomotion control on the Moon by using high-fidelity simulation and reinforcement learning; and iii) designing and constructing a lunar simulation platform and evaluate the performance of the identified controllers through experiments. The fundamental understanding of lunar locomotion mechanics can provide valuable insights into the interactions between robots and lunar terrain and inform future missions and robot design. Control theory can help explain the locomotion mechanics and accelerate training efficiency while machine learning enables the discovery of novel locomotion strategies on the Moon. Additionally, the high-fidelity simulation and the reinforcement algorithm have potential applicability in diverse terrains, including compliant and soft surfaces, thereby advancing the mobility capabilities of state-of-the-art bipedal robots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, knowledge about how students from marginalized groups see themselves and perceive others to see them as scientists is still developing. For instance, little is currently known about how disabled graduate students see their identities as both scientists and disabled individuals. Science environments may inadvertently pressure disabled students to not fully express their disability identity at risk of not being recognized as scientists by others. Disabled students likely negotiate their identities, both related to disability and science, to persist in these environments. This project will characterize disabled graduate students' experiences related to their science identity, which has been previously shown to help many marginalized students persist in STEM. In addition, this project will investigate how disabled graduate students' disability identity and other social identities (such as race, ethnicity, gender, etc.) may affect their science identities via identity negotiations. Findings from this work will identify how science graduate programs and faculty mentors can better support disabled graduate students' persistence and help disabled students better understand their own experiences in graduate programs. Supporting the persistence of disabled graduate students as they earn advanced science degrees may foster diversity within the scientific workforce. Finally, this project will support the training and professional development of an investigator aiming to become a tenure-track chemistry education researcher.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance knowledge related to how marginalized students engage in identity negotiations and better understand how disabled graduate students use different identity negotiations to persist in their science graduate programs. The study will be conducted in two phases. In phase one, a systematic literature review will be conducted to develop a theoretical framework that explains how individuals undergo identity negotiations between their science identities and social identities. The systematic review will include relevant social science and education research literature. In phase two, disabled graduate students in various science fields will be interviewed about their identity negotiation experiences. The study will be guided by the emergent framework generated by the systematic review and Critical Disability Theory. Data will be analyzed using standard qualitative approaches by a team of researchers of whom at least one or more of the researchers identifies as disabled. Findings from the study will be used to construct a conceptual model of the identity negotiations disabled students use to help them persist in science graduate programs.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overall goal is to advance more sustainable, carbon-based photocatalyst scaffolds that will reduce cost and overall environmental impact compared to traditional precious metal-based systems. The study includes the synthesis and study of new catalyst scaffolds, with the goal of advancing fundamental knowledge about how modifications affect reactivity. The new catalysts will then be studied in a variety of chemical transformations that currently rely on expensive-metal photocatalysts. The work will be built upon a new regional collaboration between UNC Charlotte and Winthrop University and will involve both undergraduate and graduate students from both research groups who will gain exposure to diverse and interdisciplinary activities across the practice of chemical research. In addition, the research components will be connected with the classroom teaching of the investigators, introducing  photochemical science topics to a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students.

TTz photocatalysts will address the need to develop scalable, high efficiency organic photocatalyst tools to drive a wide array of organic transformations. The team hypothesizes that the unique TTz photochemical properties enable new and improve upon existing transformations currently driven with expensive and toxic molecular transition-metal catalysts. Secondly, it is proposed that extended TTz photocatalyst materials will enable lower energy (e.g. red light) driven transformations while helping to tune redox characteristics for specific transformations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the ability of a series of TTzs to drive reactions with much higher efficiencies than previously used transition metal photocatalysts. The collaborative team will further explore photocatalyst stability, reaction rates, and ability to drive a range of organic transformations. A library of new TTz photocatalyst derivatives will be developed with tunable light absorption properties and redox characteristics. Photochemical studies will be carried out to establish reaction quantum yields, and rates will be monitored using fluorescence and chromogenic TTz coloration changes. This collaborative research program will focus on photochemical efficiency metrics to help guide subsequent generations of TTz photocatalysts with a focus on optimizing performance and versatility.

As a result, scholars have called on engineering educators to develop pedagogies for catalyzing students? sociotechnical design thinking competencies in engineering design education that develop students? competencies for understanding and mitigating the role of engineering in systemic inequities. However, several contextual factors, such as institutional support for reform, the social and cultural context of the institution, and state and local legislation barring faculty from teaching about ?divisive issues? like race/racism, gender/sexism, and issues facing LGBTQIA+ people, can support, or inhibit, reforms aimed at sociotechnical engineering design education. Thus, the purpose of this project is to examine the contextual influences on faculty pedagogical decision making related to sociotechnical design thinking, teaching, and learning, as well as how contextual supports and barriers impact student learning. This project will develop communities of practice within and between higher education institutions to better understand how faculty have responded to context-sensitive barriers, as well as leveraged context-specific supports, to develop and implement design pedagogies for fostering engineering students? sociotechnical design repertoires.This project?s integrated research, education, and dissemination plan will foster change in the ways engineering design education is delivered by supporting knowledge sharing and innovation within institutions, as well as capacity building across institutions, for engineering design educators.<br/><br/>Guided by the Academic Plan Model, which posits a set of sociopolitical factors internal (e.g., institutional mission, faculty governance, student characteristics) and external (e.g., local, state, and federal government, accreditation bodies) to the institution, this research will employ a multi-method research design to examine the influences on faculty pedagogical decisions in engineering design education, as well as how those decisions shape students? learning and resistance in sociotechnical design learning activities. This work is guided by the following research questions: (1) How do contextual influences, such as sociopolitical restrictions, shape the pedagogical strategies engineering design faculty adopt to teach students about addressing social inequalities in engineering design processes? (2) What educational activities catalyze students? sociotechnical design repertoires in engineering design contexts? (3) How is student resistance to sociotechnical engineering design manifested in engineering design education, and what context-specific strategies can faculty adopt to mitigate student resistance? To answer these questions, this project will employ a variety of research methods, including interview and focus group data collection to understand faculty pedagogical decision making, ethnographic methods to understand student learning in sociotechnical engineering design education, and survey data collection to examine student resistance across contexts, to achieve three broad objectives. In Objective 1 this project will convene faculty across institutional contexts for one-on-one, in-depth interviews, as well as group pedagogical reviews designed to facilitate knowledge sharing and pedagogical ideation and innovation. In Objective 2 will entail an ethnographic research study examining students? engagement in sociotechnical design learning activities across contexts. Finally, in Objective 3, to build capacity internally within and across institutions for sociotechnical design education, this project will develop a Sociotechnical Design Institute for training engineering design faculty, as well as a Sociotechnical Design Toolkit with online resources for engineering design faculty (e.g., readings, classroom activities, assignment prompts), design researchers (e.g., surveys, observations protocols), and industry professionals (e.g., design review rubrics).

We have near-ubiquitous Internet access because of our wireless infrastructure. Wireless connectivity also allows for more than access to information. The wireless Internet of Things has enabled remote control over a breadth of devices ? from a coffee pot to a drone or a Tesla. Even in the absence of a human user, wireless networks connect devices in machine-to-machine communications, and they allow our ever-growing artificial intelligence infrastructure to consume massive amounts of data from remote sensors. As data demand continues to increase, the research community is looking towards novel technologies to support the future of wireless. This includes a renewed interest in optical wireless communication (OWC) as a candidate technology for ultra-dense wireless networks. There has been extensive progress in highspeed OWC links; but there are open challenges when considering deployment of multi-user and multi-cell OWC systems in dense environments. Much of the existing work in this area is based in theory or simulation with minimal experimental validation. This tendency is due to the limited availability of toolkits that are openly accessible and possess real-time signal processing capabilities for OWC waveforms. Considering the advancements in RF communications over the past two decades, the RF community has clearly benefited from the concept of software defined radio (SDR) and related tools for RF signal processing. Namely, SDR has created a more equitable opportunity for research in wireless communications by reducing the barrier to entry and making it more feasible for researchers to physically instantiate novel ideas. This project will bring the benefits of SDR to OWC through development of an open-source OWC toolkit that integrates with widely used SDR software and equipment. The toolkit will allow researchers to implement and analyze novel techniques for multi-cell/multi-user OWC networks.<br/><br/>The toolkit?s workflow scales from low-level simulation to real-time experimental analysis, including opportunities to explore a variety of research problems that would enable practical deployment of indoor OWC networks. The developed software tools and hardware deployment playbooks will focus on test systems related to multiple access, intercell interference, and handover in dense OWC networks. This project also enables evaluation of optical wireless systems that require distributed transmitters ? including dynamic range adaptation, spatial modulation, and indoor positioning. Lastly, device usage characterization is considered in order to provide a deeper understanding of device motion/orientation in dense networks. The resulting characterization will ultimately improve the accuracy of simulations that aim to evaluate highly directional communication systems in the presence of mobile devices. The project offers merit in fundamental OWC research and in the introduction of tools to enable future contributions from the OWC community. The experimental analysis of OWC systems will provide a baseline comparison with theoretical work to either validate theoretical/simulated models or recognize the unique characteristics that may have been overlooked in modeling such systems. Characterization of mobile device usage will also offer value to the research community by improving models for dynamic devices at the scale of indoor wireless networks. In summary, this project will provide baseline experimental analysis for a variety of multi-cell/multi-user OWC systems along with an open-source platform that allows other OWC researchers to bring novel system design ideas to fruition in experimental systems. In this way, the introduction of SDR-based OWC tools will make experimental research in OWC systems more accessible to OWC researchers who have previously focused on theoretical modeling or simulation, and to those who are looking to develop a research program in OWC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the well-known summer-to-winter mesospheric and thermospheric circulations, observed tracer distribution suggests the existence of a reversed residual circulation in the lower thermosphere. However, very little work has been done to thoroughly investigate the dynamics driving the lower-thermospheric winter-to-summer circulation. This research will conduct a comprehensive study of the lower-thermospheric circulation by utilizing a mesoscale-resolving whole atmosphere model. The research aims to increase understanding of multi-scale processes in the upper atmosphere and improve the representation of compositions and plasma density in models, with transformative aspects that could contribute to our understanding of multi-step vertical coupling mechanisms. A graduate student will participate and be supported by this project, and the work will be part of the doctoral thesis.<br/><br/>This project will utilize the high-resolution Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtended (high-res WACCM-X) in System for Integrated Modeling of the Atmosphere (SIMA) framework, which can capture multi-scale interactions among processes from global scales to mesoscale. The project has two objectives. The first objective is to examine the physical processes driving the residual circulation in the thermosphere. Model-resolved wave momentum forcing, including planetary waves, tides, and gravity waves, is the primary focus of this investigation. The second objective is to investigate how the circulation affects the thermospheric compositional structure during geomagnetically quiet times. A force term analysis will be performed to examine the underlying mechanisms responsible for driving the seasonal and latitudinal variation of O/N2 in the thermosphere. Utilizing the meso-scale resolving whole atmosphere model enables a detailed examination of how multi-scale physical processes and interactions impact thermospheric compositions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The EUCLID program leverages strengths of faculty from these two institutions to provide undergraduate and graduate students a training experience that prepares them for careers in academia, industry, and government.  The EUCLID project aims to broaden participation through research, educational, and workforce development activities.  The three main objectives of the EUCLID program are as follows: (1) train graduate students in research in machine learning and optimization; (2) develop undergraduate research projects; and (3) develop a linear algebra course as part of the undergraduate Data Science and Computing major at UC Merced.<br/><br/>Recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that deep learning techniques can be used for signal recovery and image reconstruction.  Typically, deep neural networks require a large training set, and a predictor function is learned by solving an optimization problem for some given loss function.  In many physics-based applications, the observation operator is known.  The framework of deep unrolling guides the design of neural network architectures that explicitly incorporates knowledge of the physics of the sensing model.  For certain problem classes, deep unrolling learns representations of the data that reflect the constraints imposed on the architecture based on the sensing model.  In this work, the team expands on this approach in three ways.  First, the work goes beyond gradient descent to optimize the network parameters and incorporate quasi-Newton methods, which exploit previously computed iterates and gradients.  Second, the team aims to investigate alternative loss functions that better reflect the noise distribution of the measurements.  Third, the project explores optimization techniques for nonlinear physical models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI and his collaborators have broadened this conjecture to the so-called ""relative"" setting, which includes methods of studying special values of L-functions (also called zeta functions), such as in the prominent, and more recent, conjectures of Gan, Gross, and Prasad. The main tool for proving important instances of functoriality so far has been the trace formula, but in its current form it has nearly reached its limits. This project will examine ways to prove these conjectures by use of the idea of quantization, whose origins lie in mathematical physics. This idea will be used to construct novel ways of comparing (relative) trace formulas, drastically expanding their potential reach and applicability. The broader impacts of the project include conference organization and mentoring of graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI has already shown, in prior work, that in some low-rank cases one can establish relative functoriality via some novel ""transfer operators"" between relative trace formulas. Such non-standard comparisons of trace formulas were envisioned in Langlands's ""Beyond Endoscopy"" proposal; the ""relative"" setting allows for more flexibility, and more potential applications, for the exploration of such comparisons. Prior work was focused mostly on the case when the L-groups associated to the relative trace formulas are of rank one. The main goal of this project will be to examine ways to generalize the construction of transfer operators to higher rank. The main idea is to view a trace formula as the quantization of its cotangent stack, which in turn is largely controlled by the L-group. Using natural correspondences between such cotangent stacks, the project aims to construct transfer operators between their quantizations. On a separate track, the project will continue work on the duality of Hamiltonian spaces conjectured in the PI's recent work with Ben-Zvi and Venkatesh, with the aim of extending this duality beyond the hyperspherical setting, and exploring applications for the representation theory of p-adic groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, large stocks of critical data reside solely in physical archives owned and maintained by a diversity of stakeholders. These stakeholders have access to vastly different resources, which constrains their ability to make these data accessible to themselves and others, to infer their meaning, and to compare and combine it with external information. The built physically / studied digitally (BP/SD) consortium facilitates such efforts by further developing interoperable computational tools that enable organizations to extract meaning from large sets of physical documents and disseminate them in a findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable manner.  The BP/SD Consortium addresses the challenges to making this goal a reality through four thrusts addressing software development and deployment, data acquisition and dissemination, outreach and community building, and education and training. The initial focus of the BP/SD computational platform enables scholars to answer critical questions ? and to answer them faster ? in fields of research as varied as seismology, legal studies, and science policy and the history of science. These three focus areas are ones in which significant systemic inequities remain. By reducing the costs of digitization and annotation, the BP/SD platform helps bring visibility to archives centering on ?invisible? individuals and groups, and to enable underfunded initiatives to improve access to historical and current materials.  The newly digitized data brought online provides a fertile resource for entrepreneurs by increasing competition and driving innovation in areas poised for the application of AI/ML approaches that currently lack robust, accessible data. <br/><br/>The project's mission is organized around two components: the Platform and the Consortium. The Platform component will address data acquisition and software development. The Consortium component will address (i) software deployment, (ii) data dissemination, (iii) education and training, and (iv) outreach and community building. The integration of the BP/SD platform aims to: (1) Implement a persistent identifier (PID) system: engage with DataCite to assign and organize PIDs for the artifacts processed and the metadata generated. Note that for seismologic records, seismic networks of sensors are assigned DOIs, not the records themselves. To unambiguously ascertain data provenance and increase reproducibility, the project will assign PIDs to individual digitized records. (2) Develop and deploy an artifact classification pipeline: this will be guided by the principles of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. (3) Develop and deploy a data and descriptive metadata extraction pipeline. (4) Gather expert input and help develop a consensus concerning the privacy principles that will be implemented in enriching the metadata associated with a given corpus. (5) Develop and deploy a named entity extraction and disambiguation pipeline: this will be guided in the organization of named entities by ontologies such as friends of a friend (FOAF) and pay particular attention to the privacy implications arising from named entity recognition and disambiguation pipelines. (6) Develop and deploy a knowledge graph creation pipeline. (7) Implement an authentication system for managing user access to the platform. To target the expansion of the universe of users engaging with the BP/SD platform, the consortium will: (1) Develop an undergraduate course and summer internships that trains students in the use of the BP/SD platform and pursue this development in collaboration with the Metropolitan Chicago Data Science Corps (MCDC) consortium. (2) Connect groups of undergraduate and graduate students?with a special focus on under-represented demographic groups? with institutions wanting to digitize their archives via MCDC-run practica, EarthScope activities, or Computational infrastructure in Geodynamics (CIG) training programs. (3) Develop modular, adaptable, online disseminated teaching materials, and hold workshops for training faculty in their delivery in collaboration with MCDC. (4) Develop materials and hold workshops that make archive holders aware of the BP/SD consortium and platform, with the goal of including archive holders beyond the initial group of partners in the consortium. <br/><br/>This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation's Public Access Initiative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop a new approach for controlling the use of hydrogen in chemical reactions by combining electrical and thermal energy inputs. The work will allow graduate and undergraduate students to learn the modern techniques of sustainability science and collaborate to discover new catalysts and materials. The research work will also be integrated with a broad-based educational outreach effort to inform the public about the emerging transition to a more sustainable hydrogen-based energy system.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Surendranath group at MIT study how to use electrical energy to fine-tune hydrogen transfer reactions. Catalytic hydrogen transfer reactions are central to chemical synthesis and energy conversion. These reactions depend both on the activity of adsorbed hydrogen intermediates and the electric field environment at the catalyst surface. These parameters are difficult to vary independently over a wide range, impeding mechanistic inquiry and systematic control over reaction selectivity and efficiency. This project aims to develop a new approach to hydrogen transfer catalysis in which two electrochemical cells are used to independently control the activity of adsorbed hydrogen and the electric field environment for hydrogen transfer. Independent optimization of each has the potential to expose fundamentally new hydrogen transfer reactivity that could form the bedrock of new electrosynthetic processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, and other security systems that run on general-purpose computers. Such schemes perform ""deep packet inspection"" (DPI), a process by which a security device protecting an organization thoroughly examines incoming traffic and alerts administrators about suspicious activities. While DPI may be effective in some scenarios, it requires significant processing. Furthermore, if the organization receives a high volume of traffic from the Internet, DPI may not keep up with the traffic and may only inspect a fraction of it. Additionally, the inspection may not be conducted in real-time and may only detect the malware after the attack.<br/><br/>This project proposes to leverage the capability of P4 programmable data plane (PDP) switches and smartNICs to perform DPI. The project has four objectives. 1) Develop a malware detection and classification application running on PDPs, operating at line rate. The application will perform DPI of Domain Name System (DNS) packets, preventing malware from communicating with the corresponding C2 server. Traffic will be monitored in real-time, and functions commonly executed on general-purpose CPUs will be offloaded to PDPs. The plan includes analyzing DNS data, characterizing traffic patterns, and feeding such information to a machine learning (ML) algorithm. The ML algorithm will detect and classify malware according to their family (e.g., trojan, backdoor, ransomware). 2) Develop a malware detection and classification application running on a SmartNIC, for encrypted DNS packets. Research will be conducted to perform feature extraction for malware generating such packets. An ML algorithm will use the features to detect and classify the malware. 3) Develop a control application that shares threat intelligence and avoids malware propagation. As PDP switches and smartNIC detect malware, they share the threat intelligence with a centralized controller. 4) Expand the eX-IoT platform to fingerprint, store, and index newly detected and classified malware. The eX-IoT platform is a real-time platform for fingerprinting compromised devices on the Internet. The prototype running on PDPs and smart NICs will be built with open-source components available to the community, and the developed knowledge will be disseminated by synthesizing it as virtual lab libraries for courses and self-paced learning. The libraries will be distributed to colleges and universities.

These systems are increasingly crucial as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques become pervasive across various fields, including climate modeling, drug discovery, and physics simulations, significantly expanding the need for computational power and data management. However, the existing HPC infrastructures face challenges with extended job wait times and suboptimal resource use, primarily due to the escalating complexity of computations and the burgeoning demands for resources. Unlike traditional HPC tasks, AI algorithms and models exhibit distinct resource requirements, often resulting in either excess or insufficient resource allocation for AI tasks. This project aims to bridge the gap between HPC resource provisioning and AI application demands through an in-depth analysis of resource allocation and utilization within HPC environments running AI workloads. The goal is to identify strategies for minimizing resource waste and reducing the length of job queues by efficiently reallocating idle resources to accommodate large-scale AI tasks. By creating and disseminating datasets, models, algorithms, and system source code, this initiative will contribute valuable tools and insights to the research community. The findings will be broadly shared through research papers, technical reports, book chapters, course materials, and tutorials, enhancing the knowledge base in both HPC and AI fields and supporting the broader objectives of promoting scientific progress, improving national health, prosperity, and welfare, and contributing to national defense. <br/><br/>This project centers on advancing the efficiency and productivity of HPC systems by innovatively leveraging idle resources to expedite AI job processing and diminish waiting periods. The research is structured around three interconnected themes, each addressing critical aspects of resource utilization and AI performance enhancement within HPC environments. The initial theme undertakes a comprehensive analysis of idle resources in HPC systems, aiming to identify patterns and opportunities for resource optimization. Building on the insights gained, the second theme explores methodologies for the safe and timely harvesting of idle resources across various categories, ensuring that these resources can be reallocated without compromising system stability or performance. The third theme is dedicated to developing strategies that utilize these harvested resources to boost AI application outcomes significantly and, by extension, enhance the overall productivity of HPC operations. The project will implement a tangible HPC testbed equipped with real-world benchmarks and workloads alongside these thematic investigations. This testbed will serve as a platform for empirically validating developed algorithms and systems, facilitating a rigorous assessment of their effectiveness in improving HPC resource allocation and utilization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will deploy a ""self-driving"" network ? referred to as Science DMZ ? at the University of South Carolina (USC), using P4 applications running on PDP switches. The enhanced network will support science and engineering projects that foster the progress of science. Specifically, it will enable faculty members, researchers, and students to transfer big science data more efficiently within USC's campus and with external collaborators such as U.S. Department of Energy's laboratories (e.g., Savannah River, Argonne), national computing centers (e.g., San Diego Supercomputer Center, National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center), and international organizations (e.g., European Organization for Nuclear Research ? CERN). <br/><br/>The project has two objectives: 1) Develop a self-driving Science DMZ, capable of enhancing performance and fairness. Traffic will be monitored by PDP switches operating at terabits per second (Tbps) rate, and functions commonly executed on general-purpose CPUs will be offloaded to the PDP switches. The scheme will leverage the granular telemetry and the processing speed of the switches to automate the configuration of the Science DMZ and address challenges observed by USC and the community, such as traffic policing and optimal buffer sizing. Additionally, the project will extend perfSONAR to passively incorporate the telemetry generated by PDP switches, introduce real-time reporting on a per-flow basis, and add new metrics such as queue occupancy and packet interarrival time (i.e., per-packet visibility). 2) Disseminate the P4 technology by developing open-source P4 virtual lab libraries. The libraries will run on USC's cloud platform, referred to as the Academic Cloud, and on FABRIC. The Academic Cloud is used by several colleges and universities, researchers, and the cyberinfrastructure (CI) community for academic courses, workshops, and self-paced training. The libraries on FABRIC will use JupyterHub notebooks, incorporate the learner's customized topology, and embed P4 code alongside explanatory documentation, videos, and other visual aids. Finally, the project will support four PhD students and ten undergraduate students who will deploy the enhanced network under the guidance of the Principal Investigators and CI engineers.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Computer and Network Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most of these mobility data are often proprietary and thus cannot be accessed or are costly to acquire by the Science and Engineering community unless released by data owners.  Recently, under the context of Data Science for Social Good, some data owners are willing to share their mobility data with the public to unlock their values, but there are significant privacy concerns that remain in the way.  The key science driver behind this project is the gap between the lack of sanitized diverse mobility data access for the Science and Engineering community and the advance of generative Machine Learning and practical differential privacy. To bridge this gap, the project team builds a trustworthy cyberinfrastructure (CI) emulation tool called MobilityNet to (1) synthesize realistic mobility data based on real data, via privacy-preserving generative machine learning emphasizing MobilityNet's trustworthiness (i.e., utility, privacy, and fairness); and (2) share these data with the Science and Engineering community for multidisciplinary innovations by working with 19 partners. The data generated by MobilityNet have the potential for significant scientific and societal impacts via research in multiple Science and Engineering disciplines such as Computer Science, Transportation Engineering, Urban and Regional Planning, Geography, Epidemiology, and Economics. <br/><br/>This project designs MobilityNet, an innovative behavior-inspired generative CI tool for trustworthy mobility data synthesis (i.e., balancing utility, privacy, and fairness). The synthetic data will be generated via three CI components built upon validated models (such as generative machine learning and differential privacy) from both technical and human aspects: (1) cross-domain real data curation to address data bias, (2) socially-informed real data interpretation to address data implicitness, and (3) privacy-preserving synthetic data generation to address data sensitivity. The key innovation of MobilityNet is first grounded in social science, where insights are drawn from user studies to better understand the impact of the designed CI tool on utility, privacy, and fairness in a cross-domain setting; it is then materialized with a set of socially-informed technological merits on CI design and implementation (e.g., data curation and generation); it is further evaluated with measurable metrics; it finally creates impacts through synthetic data sharing to benefit the Science and Engineering community. The research vision in MobilityNet will contribute to the success of the national CI Ecosystem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To enhance the angular dynamic range of these images, the investigator will combine them with cluster images from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, whenever possible, to achieve high signal-to-noise across scales ranging from several arcminutes to ten arcseconds. This high sensitivity at various scales enables the study of shock fronts from cluster mergers, shocks arising from cosmic accretion at the cluster outskirts, and the impact of active galactic nuclei feedback on heating cluster cores.

This research project seeks to understand the fundamental science behind these dynamics and related phenomena by developing an experimental laboratory program for exploring and controlling the interactions between fluids and solid surfaces. Using high-magnification microscopes, high-speed videography, and digital image processing, the research team captures complex interactions between surface tension, viscosity, and flow speed as pipes leak, liquids break up into droplets on surfaces, and solid particles form patterns and shatter on the surfaces of fluids. By coupling the experimental observations, data analysis, and theory, this research yields novel insights into the fundamental physics of everyday phenomena that have potential applications in a range of scientific fields and industries. This project also has significant educational impact by affording dozens of undergraduate students opportunities to engage directly in cutting-edge research at a critical stage in their college careers.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>This research program investigates how geometric constraints?both local and global?interact with and change the dynamics of fluid surfaces and their instabilities in two main contexts. The first aim seeks to understand the fundamental physics that governs flow transitions in partially-wetting, thin fluid ?leaks,? including rivulet breakup and oscillation cycles between flow start and spontaneous arrest. The second aim explores capillary-driven interactions, spontaneous pattern formation, and Marangoni-driven surface fracture on flat and curved fluid surfaces with adsorbed species from the granular to the macromolecular scale. The research team employs imaging, microscopy, and high-speed videography, and digital image analysis to quantify and understand fluid surface dynamics in custom built, tabletop experiments. Each experimental system is chosen to exemplify key aspects of the overarching research questions, unified by common experimental techniques and governing physical principles. By focusing on the interaction between fluid surface dynamics and constraining geometries in carefully chosen, complementary systems, this research program reveals new, fundamental insights into the rich interplay between surface tension, curvature, flow, jamming, and fracture on fluid surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It introduces GPU-optimized algorithms and data structures, offering significant speed improvements for unstructured mesh processing, a common but challenging-to-optimize task essential to many applications.<br/><br/>This project addresses the inefficiencies in 3D geometric data processing by designing data structures that maximize the potential of GPU and multi-GPU systems.

Approximately 60 million years ago the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) moved over the Samoan and Rarotonga plumes. The OJP is the largest volcanic structure on Earth. This project will sample seamounts on top of the OJP to study the interactions between plumes and the overlying large and thick OJP. Early-career scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students will take part in the cruise. In port the science team will lead ship tours for local public schools and media. While at sea the PIs will make a training video that outlines how to prepare for and carry out a successful cruise. <br/><br/>Recent work offers tantalizing hints that the currently active Samoan hotspot may be a long-lived mantle melting anomaly, or hotspot, that has been active since the Cretaceous. Many of the 87 to 106 Ma volcanoes in the Magellan Seamount Chain, located north of the OJP, have Samoan hotspot geochemical signatures. Critically, their ages and locations match predictions for the Samoan hotspot made using absolute plate motion reconstructions. The implications for identifying a Cretaceous segment (87-106 Ma) of the Samoan hotspot are profound. First, using the same plate motion models, reconstructions of the Samoan hotspot show that the OJP passed over the Samoan plume at ~60-30 Ma, and over the Rarotonga plume?a second, possibly-long-lived hotspot?at ~60-50 Ma. Second, passage of the extraordinarily thick OJP lithosphere over the Samoan and Rarotonga plumes would have resulted in lower degree plume melts with stronger enriched mantle (EM) signatures than anywhere else along the Samoan and Rarotonga hotspot tracks. The hypothesized relationship between thicker lithosphere and stronger EM signatures is supported by the Cretaceous Samoa-related Magellan Seamounts, which exhibit a robust relationship between older (and therefore thicker) lithosphere and stronger EM signatures. A 43-day seagoing dredging expedition to sample the seamounts along the modeled traces of these two hotspot tracks on top of the OJP will test whether the OJP passed over the Samoan and Rarotonga plumes, and whether this resulted in generation of extreme EM melts. A combination of geochemical analyses and 40Ar/39Ar ages will uniquely identify contributions from these two hotspots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, the tools that the visual system uses to detect faces also lead human observers to sometimes see faces in patterns and objects that are not faces at all. Human observers may see a face in the clouds, or in a rock formation, for example, or the windows and doors of a building may look like a smiling face to a human observer. Accidental face sightings like this are an important clue about what the visual system needs to see in a pattern to decide that a picture is face-like enough to count as a face. Seeing these kinds of faces also depends on the ability to combine shapes and textures from different parts of a picture to make a larger whole. This project investigates how both of these things change during childhood, using the detection of accidental (or ?pareidolic?) faces in noisy texture images to see how children?s tendency to see faces in random patterns changes as they get older. The results advance understanding of how children?s increasing experience with their visual world affects their visual sense of what makes something look like a face.<br/> <br/>In many different ways, vision is tuned to the patterns of color and light that human observers most often in the natural world. Generally, the visual system is most sensitive to patterns that are like the ones seen in real scenes and less effective when presented with patterns that differ from this. This sensitivity to the lawful structure of the natural world has not typically been investigated in terms of how and why human observers see patterns in noise. The tendency to see faces in randomness is a particularly useful way to determine how children?s emerging understanding of natural image statistics between the ages of 5-12 years old supports the detection of complex patterns like faces and objects in clutter. To test the hypothesis that face pareidolia (detecting faces in non-face images) becomes tuned to the statistics of the visual world in childhood, the researchers ask children to find faces in noise that has been manipulated to have different statistical properties. Some of these closely reflect the structure of the real world, while others differ substantially. The results of this work establish important and novel connections between extended development of the visual system in concordance with natural image structure and the manner in which that development supports complex inferences about faces and objects in cluttered scenes.<br/> <br/>This project is jointly funded by Developmental Science, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Perception, Action and Cognition (SBE/BCS), and the Science of Broadening Participation (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microlocal analysis, with its roots in physical phenomena such as geometric optics and quantum/classical correspondence, is a powerful mathematical theory relating classical Hamiltonian dynamics to singularities of waves and quantum states. Hyperbolic dynamics is the mathematical theory of strongly chaotic systems, where a small perturbation of the initial data leads to exponentially divergent trajectories after a long time. The project takes advantage of the interplay between these two fields, studying the behavior of waves and quantum states in situations where the underlying dynamics is strongly chaotic, and also exploring the applications of microlocal methods to purely dynamical questions. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>One direction of this project is in the highly active field of quantum chaos, the study of spectral properties of quantum systems where the underlying classical system has chaotic behavior. The Principal Investigator (PI) has introduced new methods in the field coming from harmonic analysis, fractal geometry, additive combinatorics, and Ratner theory, combined together in the concept of fractal uncertainty principle. The specific goals of the project include: (1) understanding the macroscopic concentration of high energy eigenfunctions of closed chaotic systems, such as negatively curved Riemannian manifolds and quantum cat maps; and (2) proving essential spectral gaps (implying in particular exponential local energy decay of waves) for open systems with fractal hyperbolic trapped sets. A second research direction is the study of forced waves in stratified fluids (with similar problems appearing also for rotating fluids), motivated by experimentally observed internal waves in aquaria and by applications to oceanography. A third direction is to apply microlocal methods originally developed for the theory of hyperbolic partial differential equations to study classical objects such as dynamical zeta functions, which is a rare example of the reversal of quantum/classical correspondence. In particular, the PI and his collaborators study (1) how the special values of the dynamical zeta function for a negatively curved manifold relate to the topology of the manifold; and (2) whether dynamical zeta functions can be meromorphically continued for systems with singularities such as dispersive billiards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These innovative polymers blend the strength and flexibility of traditional plastics with useful features like self-healing, recyclability, and responsiveness to environmental stimuli, but controlling their structure and properties remains challenging. This research aims to uncover the fundamental factors that influence how these materials are synthesized, paving the way for advanced applications in energy storage, medical implants, and drug delivery. In addition to publications and conferences, results of this research will be disseminated via educational and outreach programs designed to reach diverse students from K12 to graduate levels. Both faculty leads play active roles in supporting undergraduate research, and women in engineering initiatives, as well as outreach programs in Baltimore's inner-city schools to foster diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>This project will employ the parallel use of experimental and computational methods to explore the essential self-assembly characteristics of multi-armed aromatic amphiphiles. By harnessing the adjustable features of entropy constraints in supramolecular design, the research aims to limit supramolecular propagation below a predefined threshold. To achieve these objectives, three key questions will be addressed. (i) Can the contour length of a supramolecular polymer be fine-tuned through strategic molecular design and/or control of its polymerization kinetics? (ii) What are the crucial factors (e.g. nucleation mechanism and growth kinetics) that regulate supramolecular polymerization? (iii) Can theoretical and computational results be utilized to define molecular principles and create blueprints for achieving self-limiting supramolecular polymerization? These studies seek to reveal the entropic parameters that govern supramolecular growth, ultimately to establish a self-limiting polymerization mechanism that would enable precise control over supramolecular polymer length and length distribution.  Correlations between molecular features and thermodynamics and kinetics associated with supramolecular polymerization will be sought throughout the project. A successful outcome will enhance foundational understanding of molecular design, chemical structure, and supramolecular dimension relationships in supramolecular polymeric systems, with potentially far-reaching implications for the development of advanced supramolecular materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carbon radicals have become an indispensable tool for the construction of complex organic molecules. However, most organic compounds must be preactivated to be effective as radical precursors, adding undesired synthetic steps and creating additional byproducts and chemical waste. Inspired by Vitamin B12 and its natural reactivity, Dr. Pitre and his research group are leveraging analogous cobalt complexes to generate carbon radicals from new classes of precursors, avoiding the need for preactivated substrates. These methods rely on visible light photochemistry to mediate radical formation, an emerging synthetic strategy that enables mild reaction conditions. Despite its importance to the field of organic chemistry, students at the undergraduate level do not receive any exposure to photochemistry in the traditional curriculum. This omission is being addressed through an annual undergraduate photochemistry workshop, which gives students that have limited access to research opportunities from across Oklahoma the chance to learn about photochemistry and its impact on the development of new chemistries. These research effort will also serve to train a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate researchers in photochemistry and catalysis.<br/><br/>Cobaloximes, which mimic the reactivity of the cobalt atom of Vitamin B12, are among the strongest nucleophiles known when in the Co(I) oxidation state and can undergo SN2 reactions with electrophiles. The resulting alkyl?cobalt can undergo facile homolytic cleavage when irradiated with visible light to generate carbon-centered radicals.  Despite having similar nucleophilicities, cobaloximes are generally less efficient than Vitamin B12 at catalyzing radical generation from electrophilic substrates. Dr. Pitre and his research team are probing the effect of the axial ligands on each step of the catalytic cycle to develop more efficient nucleophilic cobalt photocatalysts. These nucleophilic cobalt photocatalysts are being tuned to enable radical formation from new classes of precursors, including chloroform, electron-deficient alkenes, iminium ions and vinyl halides and triflates. If successful, these studies will expand understanding of cobaloxime chemistry and enhance the potential for the development and deployment of Co(I) cobaloxime catalytic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We observe them when we look at the ripples that form when we throw a pebble in a lake, the expanding ring called a wave-packet; or when we look at a rainbow that is formed when light wave passes through a prism or water droplet and note the spatial separation of white light into different colors. Partial differential equations (PDE) modeling wave propagation phenomena have played a fundamental role in understanding such physical and natural events as well as quantum mechanics, fiber optics, ferromagnetism, atmospheric and water waves, and many other physical models. In these cases, wave phenomena are never too smooth or too simple, and in fact the byproduct of nonlinear wave interactions as they propagate in time. Being able to understand and describe the dynamical behavior of such models under certain noisy conditions or given an initial statistical ensemble and have a precise description of how the inherent randomness built in these models propagates, is fundamental to accurately predict wave phenomena when studying the natural world. This project is aimed at answering several central questions about long-time dynamics and the propagation of randomness in this context using analytical and probabilistic methodologies. The work of the project, and its connections to science, promotes interdisciplinary interactions and fosters the training of graduate students and junior researchers in the United States thus fundamentally contributing to its STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The interplay of deterministic methods in nonlinear PDE and probabilistic ones naturally feed off each other and when combined contribute to a deep understanding of wave phenomena, which opens the door to new paradigms that move research forward in various directions. The Principal Investigator studies several projects at the forefront of current research. The problems, grouped in two interrelated directions, aim broadly at: (1) studying the out of equilibrium long-time dynamics of dispersive flows from a probabilistic viewpoint in energy subcritical regimes by means of suitable quantitative quasi-invariance, modified energies and stability theory of random structures; (2) establishing the invariance of Gibbs measures for the probabilistically critical three-dimensional nonlinear Schrdinger equation (also known as a model in constructive quantum field theory) in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics; (3) establishing a suitable probabilistic local theory of the hyperbolic sine-Gordon equation on 2D tori and the invariance of its associated Gibbs measure; and (4) the development of the random tensor theory for the nonlinear wave equations and for non-Gaussian data.

Although using mathematics and data science to inform decision making regarding important scientific and social issues has been growing in significance, many secondary mathematics teachers, particularly in rural areas, have had limited opportunities to learn mathematical and data modeling skills or effective ways to teach these skills to their students. This project aspires to create more opportunities and teaching support to cultivate rich opportunities for learning among rural and Native American students by enhancing teacher leaders? expertise in data science and mathematical modeling and in culturally responsive teaching practices in this context. In addition, teacher leaders will hone skills for mentoring other teachers in their schools.<br/><br/>This project at Utah State University (USU) includes partnerships with Uintah, Duchesne, and San Juan School Districts, along with Uintah River High School within the Ute Tribe Education Department in Utah. Project goals include: (1) Develop teacher leaders with expertise in data science and mathematical modeling to levels requisite for strengthening modeling and data science education; (2) Develop teacher leaders with the pedagogical expertise to incorporate culturally responsive teaching in data science and mathematical modeling lessons; (3) Develop teacher leaders who will engage with their communities through research activities and mentor prospective and early career teachers in rural and Native communities. The project will recruit and support 24 master teacher fellows (MTFs) to become exemplary teacher-leaders who engage students with mathematical modeling and data science in culturally relevant contexts.  To this end, the design of the project enables the creation of mathematical modeling and data science learning materials and instructional techniques that are grounded in the needs, culture, and experiences of rural and Native American communities. Through cultivating teacher leaders in high-need school districts with pedagogical content knowledge in mathematical modeling and data science, the project seeks to improve STEM education outcomes for students in the state of Utah. A panel comprised of professionals, educators, and state government officials will provide guidance and strategic advice to help attain project goals and maximize project outcomes. Additionally, the project evaluation employs mixed methods techniques to assess the effectiveness of the approaches used to support MTFs and examine the progress toward meeting project goals.

However, limited models exist of cervical dysplasia, a process in which abnormal cells develop in a women?s cervix, which, if untreated, can lead to cervical cancer. To enable the development of new models, we first need to understand how the material properties of the cervix change with the development of cervical dysplasia because material properties can impact the transport of drugs through tissue. In this proposal, the investigator will investigate how the tissue properties of the cervix change in cervical dysplasia. Results will guide the development of a computational model of transport through abnormal cervical tissue. The model will be validated through comparing simulated results to experimental results obtained through imaging the distribution of an injectable gel in tissue samples. In the long term, the validated computational model can support the development of therapeutic interventions for cervical dysplasia. The research will be directly integrated with a global educational initiative that brings students from the U.S. and Uganda together. Through the educational initiative, students will develop biomedical technologies to improve cancer management in underserved communities. <br/><br/>Limited models exist of cervical dysplasia, a pathophysiological process in which abnormal, precancerous cells develop in a women?s cervix. Further, a thorough understanding of how biophysical properties change during the development and progression of cervical dysplasia has not been established. Biophysical properties can impact the transport of drugs through tissue; thus, understanding how those properties change with disease progression is essential for model development. To address this need, the investigator proposes to develop a comprehensive understanding of underlying biophysical properties of cervical dysplasia and implement this understanding in developing computational models of transport through abnormal cervical tissue. The proposed work includes three research objectives: 1) characterizing salient biophysical properties of human cervical tissue to understand how those properties change with disease state, 2) developing and refining a computational model of drug transport through abnormal cervical tissue, and 3) validating the computational model through a novel three-dimensional imaging methodology to visualize the distribution of an injectable gel in human cervical tissues. The model will focus specifically on injectable hydrogel drug delivery systems, which undergo a phase transition upon injection into tissue. The proposed model will uniquely combine physics-derived principles based on cavitation rheology, mass transport, and phase separation with key biophysical parameters to simulate transport of phase-transitioning injections. Completion of these tasks will generate a validated computational model to support the development of therapeutic interventions for cervical dysplasia, which if adequately treated at the precancerous stage can prevent cervical cancer ? a disease that continues to be a top cause of cancer related deaths for women in underserved communities.

Designing efficient distributed algorithms is important for the efficient operation of the Internet, peer-to-peer networks (which power applications such as blockchains), and wireless and sensor networks.  All of these technologies are crucial to the modern economy. This project focuses on understanding the communication cost of distributed algorithms, a basic measure of the efficiency of such algorithms, with the aim of developing scalable algorithms. These will lead to improvements in distributed applications such as peer-to-peer and ad hoc wireless sensor networks, and ?big data? applications. This project will develop distributed algorithms whose communication cost is as small as possible, while also investigating the inherent limits to how small the communication cost can be.  A key part of this project will be three annual workshops on foundations and applications of distributed computing, with each of the three investigators organizing one workshop at their respective computer science departments.  These workshops will be aimed at undergraduate students from underrepresented groups from three universities: the University of Houston (a minority-serving institution), the University of Iowa, and Augusta University.  These workshops will aim to recruit students to their Computer Science programs who are more representative of the diverse pool of students at the investigators? institutions and cities. The investigators will also incorporate this research into their courses, mentoring graduate students and junior researchers, conducting tutorials and workshops at leading conferences in distributed computing, writing survey articles, and publishing a monograph on distributed algorithms.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to substantially improve our understanding of the message complexity of fundamental problems in distributed computing. These include classical distributed computing problems such maximal independent set, graph coloring, maximal matching, leader election, broadcast, breadth-first search tree, and spanners, as well as fundamental graph optimization problems such as minimum spanning tree, shortest paths, diameter, maximum matching, minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, and maximum independent set. Many of these problems have been studied extensively for decades and are widely used primitives in distributed applications. However, a lot of this prior research focuses on understanding the round complexity of these problems. The project has two key research goals: (1) prove strong message complexity upper bounds by designing message-efficient distributed algorithms and (2) prove message complexity lower bounds, thereby identifying barriers to achieving low message complexity.  In the process, the investigators aim to substantially enhance the understanding of how message complexity relates to the round complexity of problems and how it relates to the quality of approximation for fundamental graph optimization problems. The project will contribute new algorithmic techniques for proving message complexity upper bounds and new techniques for proving complementary message complexity lower bounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Signals have two equivalent mathematical representations: one containing the data we care about, and a second, Fourier dual representation, as a formal mathematical sum of functions like sines and cosines. Mathematically, one can formally convert between the two pictures, but the differences between the two points of view matter in mathematics, physics, and engineering. For example, in order to ?simplify? an image, one might naively cut it in half; a better idea is to use the Fourier transform, forget some of the information, and then apply an inverse Fourier transform; this is the basis of image compression. This project will study an incarnation of duality in a setting that involves geometry and arithmetic. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.   <br/><br/>In more detail, in the 1960?s, Robert Langlands proposed settings in number theory where similar ideas about mathematical duality could be considered. He conjectured that automorphic functions would replace signals and representations of a dual group would replace the periodicity types of sine and cosine functions. These conjectures have been the starting point for a great deal of interesting mathematics since; they contain profound arithmetic meaning in a non-abelian Fourier package. A geometric variant of Langlands' conjectures was later proposed by Beilinson and Drinfeld. This project will prove the latter conjectures for general groups and obtain applications to the classical (arithmetic) Langlands conjectures. The results will be the first global theorems of their type for general reductive groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such equations arise, for example, in the mathematical theory of heat conduction: an equation of elliptic type describes steady state (equilibrium) temperature distributions and a related parabolic equation governs heat conduction in the time-evolutive case. In a boundary value problem, one uses mathematical knowledge of either 1) the temperature distribution on the boundary (i.e., perimeter) of some region in space (or of some evolving region in space-time) or 2) the heat flux (the rate at which heat flows across the boundary), to deduce information about the internal temperature distribution inside the region. In free boundary problems, one uses simultaneous knowledge of both the boundary temperature distribution and the heat flux to deduce information about the geometry of the region and its boundary. A central goal of this project is to understand the interplay between analytic information and geometry. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project has three main areas of focus:  1) to find a geometric characterization of the space-time domains for which the Dirichlet (or initial-Dirichlet) problem is solvable for the heat equation with singular (p-integrable) data, and to study related free boundary problems. The PI and coauthors have previously treated such problems in the steady state (elliptic) setting; in the present project, the PI seeks to treat the more difficult time-evolutive case. 2) to solve the Kato square root problem for elliptic equations in non-divergence form. The solution of the Kato problem for divergence form elliptic operators has led to significant progress in the theory of boundary value problems for divergence form equations. As a first step towards opening up the analogous theory in the nondivergence setting, the PI plans to treat the Kato problem for non-divergence elliptic operators.   3) to solve the Dirichlet problem in Lipschitz domains for non-symmetric divergence from elliptic equations with periodic coefficients.  A primary motivation for the study of operators with periodic coefficients is their applicability to the theory of homogenization, which in turn provides a mathematical model for materials with periodic microstructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MCA chips consist of memristor devices organized in a grid-like structure, representing a promising foundational element for neuromorphic computing. MCA chips are expected to integrate into various aspects of our daily lives, enhancing efficiency and connectivity on a global scale. By offering high energy efficiency and brain-inspired information processing capabilities, MCA chips have the potential to reshape industries such as healthcare, robotics, and autonomous systems. Despite the transformative potential, the design process for MCA chips faces a significant challenge: a disconnect between software design tools and the physical limitations of the hardware. This disconnect often leads to performance degradation or even functional failure, resulting in costly setbacks and delays in development. As a result, extensive on-chip training procedures are typically required, further increasing the development cost, and prolonging the time to market. Thus, bridging the gap between software design tools and hardware constraints is crucial for realizing the full potential of MCA technology and expediting its integration into various applications. The outcomes of this research will be used in many industry sectors that rely on neuromorphic computing, thus producing an enormous value in the industry, economy, and society.<br/><br/>This research will address the critical challenges inherent in the design process of MCA chips. The first research involves modeling and integrating the physical constraints of memristor devices and analog circuits into software design tools for constraint-aware training and batch normalization (BN) fusion strategy. This research effort will create accurate and efficient training processes while reducing the reliance on costly on-chip training methods. Removing expensive on-chip training is essential for advancing the large-scale adoption and commercialization of memristor-based technologies in various applications, enabling cost-effective, efficient, and scalable computing solutions. In addition, we will develop an efficient hardware architecture that seamlessly aligns with software-trained models, facilitating a smooth transition from the software design domain to hardware implementation. Furthermore, we will develop transformation tools to enable rapid prototyping and deployment of software-trained models on MCA chips. Through these efforts, we anticipate achieving significant advancements in MCA chip design, resulting in enhanced performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This research will fundamentally improve the prevailing design approach and paradigm for MCA-based chips, automate the entire design cycle and enable software-hardware co-design of MCA chips. Therefore, this research will contribute to the broader goal of advancing artificial intelligence and cognitive computing through the development of efficient and innovative edge computing technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will generate new fundamental knowledge related to the design of centrifugal pendulum vibration absorbers (CPVAs) for the next-generation of electrified machinery that has the potential to improve both propulsion efficiency and driver experience for hybrid electric and electric vehicles. CPVAs consist of pendulums mounted on a rotor, driven by system rotation, and when properly tuned, can efficiently smooth problematic vibration-inducing torsional surging during operation. Current state-of-the-art overtuning approaches of a CPVA and rotor system will result in reduced vibration correction performance for a given absorber mass. This project will solve this challenge via a novel tautochronic tuning approach, which has the potential to enable more direct tuning without stability concerns, thereby reducing added driveline inertia required to achieve performance objectives. This award will also support community outreach and student research projects involving industry collaborations and the development of new curriculum in electrified propulsion engineering and training of a diverse STEM workforce. <br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to a system tautochrone tuning methodology, which consists of a path for the absorber mass to follow that accounts for the inertial coupling of the absorber to the base (rotor), and results in a constant period free vibration of the system that is independent of amplitude. This tuning methodology and its enhancements to vibration absorber design has been identified in a gravity field, but a number of important scientific questions and challenges remain for the centrifugal field. Similar to the gravity field, conditions for the tautochronic tuning in a centrifugal field will be obtained from a general period function for this oscillator that is derived by transforming the differential equation to a standard form, and then requiring that the polar angular speed is independent of the polar radial coordinate. The tautochronic tuning conditions will generally consist of a nonlinear differential equation for the radius of curvature of the absorber path, whose solution is the system tautochronic motion path. A fundamental difference in the centrifugal field is that the oscillator coefficients depend on the system momentum constant. Consisting of both absorber and rotor motion, this generalization to system momentum could revolutionize the concept of order-tuning, where a system tautochronic path is expected to remain tuned across all momentum levels, instead of just rotor speeds, as has been understood for many decades.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This motivates the search for new constructions of cryptographic primitives that would guarantee a long-term secure cyberspace, which is the focus of this project. The broader impacts of this project target all age groups,  including the organization of summer camps, graduate students training, and anti-scam seminars for elderly people.<br/><br/><br/>Our project supports the construction of new primitives in cryptography that make use of new hard mathematical problems arising from algebra and number theory.<br/>In particular, we focus on the development of a framework that allows to use the theory of Drinfeld modules to construct rank metric codes, and in turn to build new primitives in the context of code based cryptography in the rank metric. Building up on this line of research allows to target the construction of code-based cryptographic schemes that use new discrete metrics. Also, this project supports the exploration of new variants of the Hamming metric (used in classical code based cryptography) to provide a new theory of codes, with the goal to construct completely new algebraic structures that can be used as cryptographic primitives in the framework of code-based cryptography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In other words, the aim is to understand the processes through which a system's behavior evolves from periodicity toward chaos, as one or more governing parameters are varied. A related goal is to identify the primary bifurcation responsible for qualitative changes exhibited by a dynamical system. While such comprehension has previously been attained for low-dimensional dynamical systems, this project introduces a novel approach to transcend the low-dimensional limitation. The project will offer new conceptual ideas and approaches to provide fresh perspectives on advances in mathematics and science. Additionally, the project will facilitate the training of graduate students directly engaged in the research, and will afford educational opportunities to undergraduate students through the organization of a summer school presenting topics in mathematics, including topics related to dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The theory of one-dimensional dynamical systems successfully explains the depth and complexity of chaotic phenomena in concert with a description of the dynamics of typical orbits for typical maps. Its remarkable universality properties supplement this understanding with powerful geometric tools. In the two-dimensional setting, the range of possible dynamical scenarios that can emerge is at present only partially understood, and a general framework for those new phenomena that do not occur for one-dimensional dynamics remains to be developed. In prior work supported by the NSF, the principal investigator introduced a large open class of two-dimensional dynamical systems, including the classical Henon family without the restriction of large area contraction, that is amenable to obtaining results as in the one-dimensional case. Moreover, major progress was reached to understand the transition from zero entropy to positive entropy using renormalization schemes. The present project has several components. First, existing renormalization schemes will be adapted to the positive entropy realm. Next, initial steps towards a characterization of dissipative diffeomorphisms in more general contexts will be addressed. Finally, the principal investigator will seek to develop the theory of differentiable renormalization without an a priori assumption of proximity to the one-dimensional setting. These results will open the door to a global description of dissipative diffeomorphisms and their behavior under perturbation, bringing both new tools and new perspectives to smooth dynamical systems theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wavelet and frame theory is not only mathematically interesting as a subject of the study by itself, but this area has found many applications outside of pure mathematics ranging from applied and computational harmonic analysis to signal processing and data compression. Some well-known examples where wavelets are a key tool include the JPEG 2000 digital image standard and fingerprint compression for data storage. The broader impacts of the project deal with the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in the area of harmonic analysis and wavelets.<br/><br/>The project aims to answer some of the most fundamental questions in wavelet and frame theory. One of the main research directions of the project is the development of techniques for the construction of well-localized orthogonal wavelets for large classes of non-isotropic expanding dilations. A closely related complementary topic is the study of wavelets for non-expanding dilations. A recent solution of the wavelet set problem by the PI and Speegle, characterizing dilations for which there exist minimally supported frequency (MSF) wavelets, is connected with the geometry of numbers, more specifically, with the estimate on the number of lattice points of dilates of balls. Another direction of the project is the construction of frames with desired properties such as with prescribed norms and frame operator. This line of research is closely related to the infinite-dimensional generalizations of the Schur-Horn theorem. The problem of characterizing diagonals of self-adjoint operators has not only implications for frame theory but it has also been extensively studied in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Finally, the PI aims to investigate the Akemann-Weaver conjecture, which is a higher-rank extension of Weaver?s conjecture that was proven by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava in their breakthrough solution of the Kadison-Singer problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elevated rates of turnover of teachers contribute to lowered educational outcomes, particularly for high-need schools.  Improving STEM teacher retention creates conditions for science and mathematics teachers to develop their expertise and foster relationships that will strengthen school programs. The project also seeks to understand how to increase the presence of racially diverse STEM teachers by identifying cases where conditions allow STEM teachers of color to remain in the classroom. The project team will examine large quantitative data sets to track STEM teacher movement and instructional effectiveness in the state of Connecticut. Statistical analyses will be complemented by interviews with practicing STEM teachers. This research has the potential to improve understanding of STEM teacher retention patterns and the relationships between teacher movement and instructional effectiveness. The results of this study have the potential to inform school district decision-making and state official policy-shaping, driving the development of data-driven interventions focused on STEM teacher retention in the service of effectiveness and equity. <br/><br/>This project at the University of Connecticut has three goals. The first is to uncover school factors strongly associated with greater teacher retention and subsequent teaching effectiveness. The project team will achieve this goal via quantitative analyses of data collected by the state of Connecticut as part of routine practices. The second is to examine intersections of teacher identity (race and gender) contributing to STEM teacher retention and effectiveness as measured by data collected annually by the state of Connecticut to monitor highly qualified teaching, educator certification, and school staffing. The third is to conduct iterative interviews with practicing STEM teachers of various demographics (i.e., White, Black, Latinx, and Asian) to seek their perspectives about forces influencing STEM teacher retention, movement between schools, and effectiveness. Using a participatory design research approach, the project team will also provide periodic updates of the study?s statistical outputs to these teachers to solicit their interpretations and recommendations. In this way conversational cycles throughout the project will help to refine the quantitative analyses. The overall investigation will draw from three theoretical frames: conservation of resources, goal congruity, and sociopolitical consciousness. Multilevel analyses will identify factors associated with the retention of effective STEM teachers. Graph theory techniques will assess movement, including a social network analysis of matched pairs to assess impact of relevant factors.

Later, this was extended to encompass strong and weak interactions, so that torsors became a basis for the so-called Standard Model - a physical theory describing all fundamental forces except for gravitation. The standard model predicted the existence of various particles, the last of which, called the Higgs boson, was found in a Large Hadron Collider experiment in 2012. In 1950's Fields medalist Jean-Pierre Serre recognized the importance of torsors in algebraic geometry. In his 1958 seminal paper he gave the first modern definition of a torsor and formulated a certain deep conjecture. The first part of this project is aimed at proving this conjecture, which is among the oldest unsolved foundational questions in mathematics. The second part of the project is related to the so-called Higgs bundles, which can be thought of as mathematical incarnations of the Higgs bosons. More precisely, the PI proposes to prove a certain duality for the spaces parameterizing Higgs bundles. This duality is a vast generalization of the fact that the Maxwell equations describing electromagnetic fields are symmetric with respect to interchanging electrical and magnetic fields. The duality is a part of the famous Langlands program unifying number theory, algebraic geometry, harmonic analysis, and mathematical physics. This award will support continuing research in these areas. Advising students and giving talks at conferences will also be part of the proposed activity.<br/><br/>In more detail, a conjecture of Grothendieck and Serre predicts that a torsor under a reductive group scheme over a regular scheme is trivial locally in the Zariski topology if it is rationally trivial. This conjecture was settled by Ivan Panin and the PI in the equal characteristic case. The conjecture is still far from resolution in the mixed characteristic case, though there are important results in this direction. The PI proposes to resolve the conjecture in the unramified case; that is, for regular local rings whose fibers over the ring of integers are regular. A more ambitious goal is to prove the purity conjecture for torsors, which is, in a sense, the next step after the Grothendieck?Serre conjecture. The second project is devoted to Langlands duality for Hitchin systems, predicting that moduli stacks of Higgs bundles for Langlands dual groups are derived equivalent. This conjecture may be viewed as the classical limit of the geometric Langlands duality. By analogy with the usual global categorical Langlands duality, the PI formulates a local version of the conjecture and the basic compatibility between the local and the global conjecture. The PI will attempt to give a proof of the local conjecture based on the geometric Satake equivalence for Hodge modules constructed by the PI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Amid the post-pandemic era, teacher preparation programs have been demonstrating resilience in adapting to this challenge with a focus on addressing enrollment fluctuations and bridging prospective teachers? knowledge in key areas. This project aims to strengthen the mathematics and science teacher pathways by attracting, training, and keeping talented STEM majors within the teaching profession, especially for high-need school districts. The investigators will actively expand partnerships to attract STEM majors with a genuine passion for teaching and provide streamlined professional development opportunities during both their teacher preparation program and the first year of teaching. Through these initiatives, the project will focus on empowering prospective teachers to meet the specific needs of urban schools and reinforcing their commitment to pursue careers in teaching. As a result, this project has the potential to increase the number of well-equipped STEM in high-need middle schools and high schools within the New York City public school system.<br/><br/>This project at the College of Staten Island includes partnerships with the Kingsborough Community College and the New York City Public Schools on Staten Island and Brooklyn. Project goals include: 1) expand recruitment by building bridge programs with community colleges within the City University of New York to include students from a wider geographical area, such as Brooklyn; 2) refine enrichment activities to engage prospective teachers in reflective practices; and 3) build a teacher induction program for newly graduated teachers. This project will fund 30 high-achieving undergraduate students to complete a Bachelor of Science in biology, chemistry, earth sciences, mathematics, or physics and obtain a New York State initial teaching certification. The anticipated products of the project include a refined model for preparing talented STEM majors to teach in high-need schools, a set of enrichment activities that support the growth of prospective teachers to become reflective educators, and an induction program focused on facilitating a seamless transition from prospective teacher preparation to successful in-service teaching. To assess the effectiveness of the project, a longitudinal design will be implemented, which involves utilizing surveys, observations, interviews, and education records to monitor, document, and evaluate the project?s development and outcome. These data will also inform the design of preservice coursework for secondary education programs for mathematics and science majors. The results will be broadly disseminated through various channels, including the project website, scholarly journal articles, and presentations at regional and national conferences.

Additionally, the project aims to address the need to develop STEM teachers prepared to improve access to mathematics for diverse populations of middle and high school students. The project will recruit undergraduate mathematics majors to careers in secondary mathematics teaching. These prospective teachers will be prepared by engaging in coursework, weekly field experiences in community school settings, activities with multiple teaching and community mentors, and a video-based induction program, among other activities. The project is innovative in grounding secondary mathematics teacher preparation in community school settings where schools provide community resources to address inequities and support student success.<br/><br/>This project at Binghamton University-State University of New York includes partnerships with three high-need local central school districts (Harpursville, Maine Endwell, and Whitney Point) and the Southern Tier Master Teacher Program. Through these partnerships, the project aims to prepare 24 new middle and high school teachers over five years. These prospective teachers will be recruited from undergraduate majors in mathematics. The project is designed to support the pedagogical practices, beliefs, and identity development of secondary mathematics teachers to be effective educators in high-need school districts through a focus on community, equity, and inclusion. Project goals include: (a) increasing the number of diverse and academically strong secondary mathematics teachers; (b) developing scholars understanding and engagement with community schools; (c) fostering scholars awareness of their own histories, identities, biases, assumptions, and relationships to mathematics, and how these shape their students' classroom experiences and learning opportunities in mathematics; (d) preparing scholars to address issues of equity, access, inclusion, and privilege within the teaching and learning of mathematics in high-need schools; and (e) retaining scholars in the field of secondary mathematics education in high-need school districts. Program evaluation will identify strengths and weaknesses of the recruitment, preparation, and retention efforts of the project with the goal of making informed improvements. Findings have the potential to highlight effective approaches for preparing and retaining highly qualified secondary mathematics committed to supporting their students to be successful as mathematics learners both in and out of the classroom.

One approach to increasing participation in engineering has been focused on providing training to students that lack certain skills with the expectation that this support will help them to remain in engineering. One of the skills that students lack that has been identified in engineering education research is the skill to visualize and understand space. Most research has focused on identifying students who struggle with these skills and providing them with training to improve. Instead, this project will focus on the skills that students come with to engineering to better understand what changes to how engineering is taught can be made to support students with a range of skills to visualize and understand space. This project will build a solid foundation for the PI to be a life-long leader in discipline-based education research and re-envisioning engineering spaces. This project will contribute to the Research in the Formation of Engineers program by working to transform the engineer-formation system. <br/><br/>The aim of this project will be to transform the engineer-formation system by applying an anti-deficit perspective to re-envision engineering pedagogy to support a range of visuo-spatial skills. This project will be the first comprehensive and theory-based study exploring the strategies used by students to navigate visuo-spatial challenges in engineering. The work will challenge the deficit-orientated ideologies broadly adopted within current engineering education by taking an anti-deficit perspective (i.e., asset orientated perspective), to identify and leverage the strategies students use to be successful in undergraduate engineering degree programs. The overarching research question is ?In what ways can an engineering program be re-envisioned to facilitate visuo-spatially diverse students?? This project will interview students with a range of visuo-spatial skills to identify the strategies they use to navigate visuo-spatial challenges across a four-year engineering curriculum and explore the ways that visuo-spatial language and gestures are embedded in engineering curriculum through ethnographic-inspired course observations. The project will result in methodological contributions to the larger educational research community beyond engineering (e.g., geology, chemistry, biology) in terms of the use of asset-based approaches and qualitative methods to study visuo-spatial skills.  The outcomes of the integrated research and education aims will directly have an impact on recruiting and retaining students in engineering who have a range of visuo-spatial skills. Through the unique education aim, a co-development workshop, both students and engineering instructors will be able to take action in enacting change. The integrated research and education plan overcomes several commonly encountered limitations in the adoption of pedagogical activities by integrating the stakeholders? (students and faculty) perspectives and concerns directly into the research and education outcomes.

As the products of millions of years of natural evolution, enzymes are capable of facilitating otherwise challenging reactions and exerting exquisite control over these processes under sustainable and environmentally friendly conditions. Over the past several years, biocatalysis researchers have capitalized on unnatural electron transfer mechanisms and developed a range of biocatalytic reactions which were not known in natural enzymology. Despite these recent advances, the detailed mechanisms and the origins of selectivity in these recently developed enzymatic reactions remain to be elucidated. Combining physical organic chemistry and the state-of-the-art computational chemistry tools, this research is expected to shed light on the mechanisms, reactivities, and selectivity patterns emerging from these new enzymatic reactions.  The lessons learned from these studies will likely lead to new design principles for retooled biocatalyst development. By promoting ideas exchange between experimental and computational chemists with a biotechnology focus and engaging a diverse research team, PIs Yang and Liu are targeting synergy. At the same time, they are building a strong cross-disciplinary research environment to train skilled members of the future workforce in mechanistic, molecular biocatalysis with important implications for biomanufacturing.<br/><br/>This award supports a collaborative effort between the Yang group at UC-Santa Barbara and the Liu group at U Pittsburgh.  The team aims to further fundamental understanding of recently developed stereoselective biocatalytic radical reactions. Using a combination of density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics simulation (MDS), and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods, this research will investigate the protein-regulated electron and atom transfer mechanisms in recently developed reactions using cofactor-dependent enzymes. This project will develop computational models to rationalize enzyme-controlled chemoselective cyclizations with recently evolved biocatalysts. By integrating mechanistic enzymology and computation, the two research groups seek to elucidate how bifunctional biocatalysis can serve as a general means to facilitate unnatural enzymatic reactions. If successful, this study will provide  mechanistic insight at the forefront of biocatalytic research that is directed at new-to-nature transformations for synthetic application.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups specify symmetry types; for instance, all bilaterally symmetric animals share a symmetry group, which is different from that of a starfish or of a sand dollar.  Important examples of groups arise from the study of symmetry in geometry and in algebra (where symmetries of number systems are captured by ``Galois groups'').  Groups can often be usefully expressed as finite sequences of basic operations,   like face-rotations for the Rubik's cube group, or gates acting on the state of a quantum computer.  One typical problem is understanding which groups can actually arise in situations of interest.  Another is understanding, for particular groups, whether all the elements of the group can be expressed efficiently in terms of a single element or  by a fixed formula in terms of varying elements.  The realization of a particular group as the symmetry group of n-dimensional space is a key technical method to analyze these problems. The award will also support graduate student summer research. <br/><br/>The project involves using  character-theoretic methods alone or in combination with  algebraic geometry, to solve problems about finite simple groups.  In particular, these tools can be applied to investigate  questions about solving equations when the variables are elements of a simple group.  For instance, Thompson's Conjecture, asserting the existence, in any finite simple group of a conjugacy class whose square is the whole group, is of this type.  A key to these methods is the observation that, in practice, character values are usually surprisingly small.  Proving and exploiting variations on this theme is one of the main goals of the project.  One class of applications is to the study of representation varieties of finitely generated groups, for instance Fuchsian groups.  In a different direction, understanding which Galois groups can arise in number theory and how they can act on sets determined by polynomial equations, is an important goal of this project and, indeed, a key goal of number theorists for more than 200 years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When we study how materials deform under stress or conduct electricity, we often use equations to describe these phenomena. However, some equations don't behave smoothly, especially when dealing with high contrast materials or complex shapes. These situations can lead to equations that are much harder to analyze, and traditional methods may not work. Another area of study is equations from fluid dynamics. Understanding these questions is crucial for practical applications like designing airplanes or predicting weather patterns, and it also inspires new ideas in mathematics and statistics. Finally, the Principal Investigator (PI) is interested in kinetic equations, which describe how particles move and interact in systems like nuclear fusion experiments. By studying these equations, scientists hope to improve our understanding of how plasmas behave in extreme conditions, such as inside a tokamak. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/> <br/>As part of this project, the PI will carry out research closely related to the aforementioned topics and will attempt to address some of the open problems in these areas. The focus will be on several projects that can be gathered into three main topical areas. First, the project will develop new methods to study elliptic equations arising in composite materials (e.g., elasticity problems, conductivity problems). The PI is particularly interested in the blowup behaviors of solutions to PDE in domains with Lipschitz inclusions, equations involving the p-Laplacian, and the insulated problem for the Lam system. Second, the project will explore the free boundary problem involving an incompressible fluid permeating a porous medium, often referred to as the one-phase Muskat problem. The focus will be on investigating the regularity of solutions to the two- and three-dimensional one-phase Muskat problem in the whole space, as well as on exploring the short-term and long-term smoothing effects of these solutions. Finally, the project will investigate boundary regularity of linear kinetic equations as well as the stability and global well-posedness of nonlinear kinetic equations, including the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system and the spatially inhomogeneous Boltzmann equations in general domains.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the compounds with the most specific connection to diseases are proteins. To confidently detect proteins quickly and easily, electronic sensors that signal when they are in contact with the proteins are needed. One way to improve the certainty that a sensor signal is indicating the presence of a particular protein is to  remove signals that come from other compounds in the liquids being analyzed, like salt, fats, or non-target proteins. This project will investigate a new circuit, constructed with new biologically-derived electronic materials, designed to remove these unwanted signals. If one part of a circuit responds to an interfering protein, another part cancels the signal out. The activities of the proposal include making new electronic materials for the circuits and devising computer models that teach the mechanism by which the materials would respond when used. Other activities will attract and train students at multiple levels, high school through college, in materials, electronic, computer, and analytical technologies. Graduate students will gain highly multidisciplinary training, including polymer synthesis, surface electronics, device technology, and theoretical modeling. Students from underrepresented minority populations will be recruited to work on this project through outreach to the summer ?Explore Engineering Innovation? and ?Biomedical Engineering Innovation? courses at Johns Hopkins University. A demonstration and modeling activity for this course will be developed.<br/><br/>There is an ongoing need for fast, sensitive, and stable sensors for disease biomarkers. Electronic biosensors signal biomarker complexation to receptors via changes in local electronic parameters such as interfacial potential and complex impedance. The origins of these parameter changes include ionic redistributions, functional group reorientation, and changes in the polarizability of receptors and are reported via field-effect transistors (FETs). However, FET baseline instability remains a barrier to sensitive and reliable biomarker detection. This project explores an unprecedented ?dual-series gate? organic electrochemical transistor (DS-OECT) that substantially cancels baseline instability for greater signal/drift ratios, enabling assignment of instability to surface potential and impedance fluctuations. A pair of device interfaces connected in opposite polarities decrease response drift, increasing the probability of correct analyte identification. The objectives include material synthesis, device fabrication, computer modeling, and biological fluid analysis. Various hypotheses about the device response mechanisms will be tested.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will enhance spatial cognition and streamline navigation, increase personal freedom and empowerment, and ensure the well-being and health of visually impaired individuals. The project will address challenges related to analyzing complex scenes with multiple sound sources and generating representable synchronous sound through audio-visual synchronization with moving objects. This will provide content-wise relevant, augmented sound alerts of the most immediate events to users.

Additional deliverables of this project will include engineering research experiences for students from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, including under-represented minority groups.<br/><br/>The research will develop a novel AI-driven sensory augmentation framework for human sensory augmentation that can leverage the potential of semantic representative sound and alleviate the limitation of considering subsequent motion changes in a visual scene. The design will incorporate visual-to-sound-synthesizing AI model design through an efficient visual action recognition approach, followed by a deep sound generative model facilitated by cloud-based continuous learning concepts. The project includes an empirical study to analyze the impact of natural sound over vocal auditory cues for the visually impaired person (VIP). This study will contribute to assessing the effect of natural auditory guidance on VIPs towards assisting them in understanding the layout of their surroundings and facilitating spatial orientation and mobility. Consequently, it will help analyze how interacting with objects/scenarios in the environment significantly enhances the independence, accessibility, and overall well-being of visually impaired people while using the aid.

The purpose of this session is to bring together international experts in a variety of areas of arithmetic geometry, automorphic forms, and function field arithmetic. The emphasis of the conference will be on recent spectacular developments in the theory of Drinfeld modules and their generalizations. The conference will increase international collaboration between mathematicians from different parts of the world. This award will cover the travel expenses of invited participants from the United States, with the priority given to junior researchers and members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Since their emergence in 1970s, Drinfeld modules and their moduli spaces had a tremendous impact on arithmetic geometry, leading to a successful resolution of the global and local Langlands conjectures over function fields. Over the last few years, there has been an explosion of activity in function field arithmetic, with many spectacular results on special values of higher derivatives of L-functions of automorphic forms, special values of Carlitz-Goss L-functions, and Drinfeld modular forms. In all these works, Drinfeld modules and their generalizations play a prominent role. Moreover, new tantalizing connections have been discovered between different topics of function field arithmetic, such as special values of characteristic p zeta functions, deformations of Drinfeld modular forms, and function field analogue of Fontaine?s theory. These developments, along with possible future directions of research, will be addressed by the invited speakers of the special session with the hope to inspire new generations to take part in this important and very active area of Number Theory.

These systems are increasingly crucial as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques become pervasive across various fields, including climate modeling, drug discovery, and physics simulations, significantly expanding the need for computational power and data management. However, the existing HPC infrastructures face challenges with extended job wait times and suboptimal resource use, primarily due to the escalating complexity of computations and the burgeoning demands for resources. Unlike traditional HPC tasks, AI algorithms and models exhibit distinct resource requirements, often resulting in either excess or insufficient resource allocation for AI tasks. This project aims to bridge the gap between HPC resource provisioning and AI application demands through an in-depth analysis of resource allocation and utilization within HPC environments running AI workloads. The goal is to identify strategies for minimizing resource waste and reducing the length of job queues by efficiently reallocating idle resources to accommodate large-scale AI tasks. By creating and disseminating datasets, models, algorithms, and system source code, this initiative will contribute valuable tools and insights to the research community. The findings will be broadly shared through research papers, technical reports, book chapters, course materials, and tutorials, enhancing the knowledge base in both HPC and AI fields and supporting the broader objectives of promoting scientific progress, improving national health, prosperity, and welfare, and contributing to national defense. <br/><br/>This project centers on advancing the efficiency and productivity of HPC systems by innovatively leveraging idle resources to expedite AI job processing and diminish waiting periods. The research is structured around three interconnected themes, each addressing critical aspects of resource utilization and AI performance enhancement within HPC environments. The initial theme undertakes a comprehensive analysis of idle resources in HPC systems, aiming to identify patterns and opportunities for resource optimization. Building on the insights gained, the second theme explores methodologies for the safe and timely harvesting of idle resources across various categories, ensuring that these resources can be reallocated without compromising system stability or performance. The third theme is dedicated to developing strategies that utilize these harvested resources to boost AI application outcomes significantly and, by extension, enhance the overall productivity of HPC operations. The project will implement a tangible HPC testbed equipped with real-world benchmarks and workloads alongside these thematic investigations. This testbed will serve as a platform for empirically validating developed algorithms and systems, facilitating a rigorous assessment of their effectiveness in improving HPC resource allocation and utilization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, symmetries respected by the invariant lead to powerful refinements that detect rich information and have computationally useful properties such as additivity and multiplicativity.   This project will develop similar rich generalizations of topological invariants where symmetry plays an essential role. In addition to graduate student mentoring, summer school organization, and service to local and national committees, the PI will continue to organize undergraduate quilting projects at U of Kentucky, designing and making quilts with significant mathematical content, while attracting new students to mathematics.<br/><br/>This project centers on three clusters of ideas: 1) invariants for fixed points, periodic points, and flows refining the Euler characteristic, 2) generalizations of algebraic Lefschetz and Riemann-Roch theorems to endomorphisms, and 3) traces in topological settings that enjoy significant algebraic structure.  These questions all build on a vast generalization of the trace of a matrix that can be applied in topological and algebraic examples.  For this trace, finite dimensionality is replaced by a notion of dualizability and the examples above manifest different forms of this dualizability.

However, most of these mobility data are often proprietary and thus cannot be accessed or are costly to acquire by the Science and Engineering community unless released by data owners.  Recently, under the context of Data Science for Social Good, some data owners are willing to share their mobility data with the public to unlock their values, but there are significant privacy concerns that remain in the way.  The key science driver behind this project is the gap between the lack of sanitized diverse mobility data access for the Science and Engineering community and the advance of generative Machine Learning and practical differential privacy. To bridge this gap, the project team builds a trustworthy cyberinfrastructure (CI) emulation tool called MobilityNet to (1) synthesize realistic mobility data based on real data, via privacy-preserving generative machine learning emphasizing MobilityNet's trustworthiness (i.e., utility, privacy, and fairness); and (2) share these data with the Science and Engineering community for multidisciplinary innovations by working with 19 partners. The data generated by MobilityNet have the potential for significant scientific and societal impacts via research in multiple Science and Engineering disciplines such as Computer Science, Transportation Engineering, Urban and Regional Planning, Geography, Epidemiology, and Economics. <br/><br/>This project designs MobilityNet, an innovative behavior-inspired generative CI tool for trustworthy mobility data synthesis (i.e., balancing utility, privacy, and fairness). The synthetic data will be generated via three CI components built upon validated models (such as generative machine learning and differential privacy) from both technical and human aspects: (1) cross-domain real data curation to address data bias, (2) socially-informed real data interpretation to address data implicitness, and (3) privacy-preserving synthetic data generation to address data sensitivity. The key innovation of MobilityNet is first grounded in social science, where insights are drawn from user studies to better understand the impact of the designed CI tool on utility, privacy, and fairness in a cross-domain setting; it is then materialized with a set of socially-informed technological merits on CI design and implementation (e.g., data curation and generation); it is further evaluated with measurable metrics; it finally creates impacts through synthetic data sharing to benefit the Science and Engineering community.

Motivation to study these questions can be found in partial differential equations, which are fundamental to the study of science and engineering. The solution to a partial differential equation is frequently given by an integral operator, a Calderon-Zygmund operator, whose related properties can be used to deduce related properties of these partial differential equations. In general, studying these Calderon-Zygmund operators is challenging and one seeks to study their action on certain spaces of functions, by checking the behavior only on a simpler class of test functions. In analogy, this can be seen as attempting to understand a complicated musical score by simply understanding a simpler finite collection of pure frequencies. The proposed research is based on recent contributions made by the PI, leveraging the skills and knowledge developed through prior National Science Foundation awards. Through this proposal the PI will address open and important questions at the interface of analytic function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.  Resolution of questions in these areas will provide for additional lines of inquiry.  Funds from this award will support a diverse group of graduate students whom the PI advises; helping to increase the national pipeline of well-trained STEM students for careers in academia, government, or industry.<br/><br/>The research program of this proposal couples important open questions with the PI's past work.  The general theme will be to use methods around ``testing theorems,'' called ``T1 theorems'' in harmonic analysis or the ``reproducing kernel thesis'' in analytic function theory and operator theory, to study questions that arise in analytic function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.  In particular, applications of the proof strategy of testing theorems will: (1) be used to characterize when Calderon-Zygmund operators are bounded between weighted spaces both for continuous and dyadic variants of these operators; (2) serve as motivation for a class of questions related to operators on the Fock space of analytic functions that are intimately connected to Calderon-Zygmund operators; and, (3) be leveraged to provide a method to study Carleson measures in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of analytic functions.

The notion of symmetry is fundamental in classical physics. A famed result of Emmy Noether shows that for each symmetry of the laws of nature, there is a resulting conserved physical quantity. For example, the time invariance of the laws of physics results in the law of conservation of energy. In the setting of quantum physics, the more general notion of quantum symmetries is required to understand the behavior of the system. This project concerns the study of how quantum symmetries act on certain systems, with the end goal being to fully understand and classify these actions. We refer to these actions of quantum symmetries as `higher representation theory?. Particular emphasis will be placed on the examples which are relevant to topological quantum computation. This project will involve research opportunities for undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire.<br/><br/>More technically, the notion of quantum symmetry is characterized mathematically by a tensor category, and the actions of quantum symmetries are characterized by module categories over these tensor categories. This project will study fundamental problems on the construction and classification of module categories. The following research problems will be addressed: 1) construct and classify the module categories over the tensor categories coming from the Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theories, 2) construct new continuous families of tensor categories which interpolate between the categories coming from conformal field theories, 3) use Jones?s graph planar algebra techniques to study Izumi?s near-group tensor categories, and 4) investigate the higher categorical objects related to the module categories in 1).<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They arise as effective models of real physical systems, including in optics and many-body quantum mechanics. It is in the setting of completely integrable systems that solitons and multisolitons were first discovered. These structures have since found numerous applications in the applied sciences: for example, in fiber optics, solitons have been employed in the transmission of digital signals over long distances, while in biology, they are used to describe signal propagation in the nervous system and low-frequency collective motion in proteins. This project seeks to investigate both longstanding and newly introduced integrable models. Specifically, we seek to find the minimal conditions on the initial state under which one can construct global-in-time dynamics, investigate the (in)stability of special structures (such as solitons and multisolitons), and elucidate the long-time behavior of general solutions. The project provides significant research training opportunities for graduate students, who are integrated into the main objectives of the project. <br/><br/>The project investigates the following specific questions for the newly introduced continuum Calogero-Moser equations: (1) large data well-posedness in the scaling-invariant space, (2) scattering for both the defocusing model and the focusing equation for initial data with mass less than that of the ground state soliton, and (3) the determination of the blowup threshold in the focusing case. Further objectives include orbital and asymptotic stability of multisoliton solutions to the Benjamin-Ono equation in optimal well-posedness spaces, dispersive decay away from the soliton component for large solutions to this equation, and the construction of Gibbs dynamics for the Landau-Lifshitz model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, at present there is no proven algorithm to decide whether or not a given elliptic curve has finite or infinitely many rational solutions. Over the past century, mathematicians conjectured that an answer to these questions could be extracted from certain functions of a complex variable, namely the L-function of the elliptic curve. Euler systems and Iwasawa theory are two of the most powerful tools available to date for the study of these and related conjectured links between arithmetic and analysis.

In rank 1, they will prove the first p-converse to the celebrated theorem of Gross-Zagier and Kolyvagin in the case of elliptic curves defined over totally real fields. In rank 2, they will continue their investigations of the generalized Kato classes introduced a few years ago by Darmon-Rotger, establishing new nonvanishing results in the supersingular case. They will also study a systematic p-adic construction of Selmer bases for elliptic curves over Q of rank 2 in connection with the sign conjecture of Mazur-Rubin. For elliptic curves of arbitrary rank, they will establish various non-triviality results of associated Euler systems and Kolyvagin systems, as first conjectured by Kolyvagin and Mazur-Tate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The name derives from the word matrix:  given a matrix A, there is an associated matroid that records the information of which subsets of the columns of A are linearly dependent.  Not all matroids arise in this manner, but those that do form a large class of matroids that provide good intuition for matroids in general.  There has been an explosion of work on matroids in the past ten years, thanks largely to the work of June Huh, which was recognized with a 2022 Fields Medal.  Huh has used techniques from algebraic geometry to resolve conjectures about matroids that have been open for many years, including Welsh's log concavity conjecture from 1976, and Dowling and Wilson's top heavy conjecture from 1975.  The common theme behind the various directions of this project is to upgrade various theorems, conjectures, and constructions involving numerical invariants of matroids to richer structures that take symmetries of matroids into account. Broader impacts of the project include mentoring of graduate students and workshop organization. <br/><br/>The first  project will enrich our understanding of log concavity and real rootedness in the context of matroid invariants by working equivariantly.  In special cases, it allows  to ask new questions about the cohomology of the configuration space of points in the plane, and about Eulerian polynomials.  The second project sheds light on the mysterious notion of valuativity by recasting it in categorical terms, and provides a method for compute large classes of matroid invariants equivariantly. The third project introduces the notion of the local h-polynomial of a matroid, and has the potential to make new inroads into classical questions about matroid realizability and graph colorability.

Depending on the alloy, different atomic types arrange in either an ordered or disordered way within a crystal. Alloys where the different atoms have a disordered or random arrangement can benefit from improved properties including increased strength or corrosion resistance. It has recently been proposed that in some disordered alloys the actual atomic arrangement could be more subtle, appearing to be ordered (or non-random) over short distances and disordered over longer distances. This phenomenon, known as short range ordering, is implicated in the exceptional properties of a recently developed group of alloys known as multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) that have particular promise for next-generation applications in power generation and national defense. However, one difficulty is that short range ordering remains problematic to measure. This research will use a microscope called an atom probe to detect the types and locations of individual atoms, but with an uncertainty that can make the measurement of subtle ordering inconclusive. Here, artificial intelligence will be used to detect any short range ordering present within the data. Using this new means of analysis, the project will then test the idea that short range ordering in stable conditions is independent of how the alloy was made. In doing so, this project will have a broad impact on understanding how to engineer short range ordering in alloys by means of their processing, all of which has implications for how MPEAs will develop as next-generation materials. Alongside the research, artificial intelligence teaching modules will be created to expose and educate middle and high school students in the use of this emerging technology. These will be disseminated through a workshop for secondary school teachers on how to integrate materials-centric examples into physics, chemistry, and physical science classrooms.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), often called high-entropy alloys, are an emerging alloy class with initial evidence of exceptional mechanical properties and significant compositional design flexibility. However, the rational design of MPEAs is hindered by a lack of fundamental knowledge about the chemical short range order (SRO), which are the local correlations in the distribution of atomic species. This project will characterize the evolution of SRO in a model CrCoNi MPEA to evaluate two hypotheses; first, that SRO in MPEAs reaches a stable state that is independent of the fabrication conditions, and second, that the relaxation time to the stable SRO is governed by diffusion kinetics (which themselves depend on the SRO). Samples will be fabricated by vacuum arc melting, direct current sintering, and high-pressure torsion consolidation to generate measurably different initial SRO states. SRO characterization will be done by atom probe tomography (APT) cross-correlated with electron scattering for a pair distribution function as well as energy filtered high resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging. The APT datasets will be analyzed by a machine learning approach where the data is modeled as a sample from an underlying pairwise-interaction Markov point process. Experimental data from a series of isothermal annealing experiments will be used to calibrate a mathematical model for the mutual interactions of the SRO and the self-diffusivity. The model will be used to develop time-temperature-SRO diagrams for MPEAs to be integrated into service. The project is expected to deliver: (1) Maturation of a fundamental scientific understanding of MPEAs? compositional stability from which these materials can be deployed into service in extreme environments. (2) A robust machine learning APT analysis method that expands the technique to address high solute clustering characteristics in alloys. (3) The development of the next-generation STEM workforce at the graduate level as well as through secondary school teachers via a materials camp that instructs how to incorporate materials into the physics, chemistry, and physical science curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has recently been proposed that in some disordered alloys the actual atomic arrangement could be more subtle, appearing to be ordered (or non-random) over short distances and disordered over longer distances. This phenomenon, known as short range ordering, is implicated in the exceptional properties of a recently developed group of alloys known as multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) that have particular promise for next-generation applications in power generation and national defense. However, one difficulty is that short range ordering remains problematic to measure. This research will use a microscope called an atom probe to detect the types and locations of individual atoms, but with an uncertainty that can make the measurement of subtle ordering inconclusive. Here, artificial intelligence will be used to detect any short range ordering present within the data. Using this new means of analysis, the project will then test the idea that short range ordering in stable conditions is independent of how the alloy was made. In doing so, this project will have a broad impact on understanding how to engineer short range ordering in alloys by means of their processing, all of which has implications for how MPEAs will develop as next-generation materials. Alongside the research, artificial intelligence teaching modules will be created to expose and educate middle and high school students in the use of this emerging technology. These will be disseminated through a workshop for secondary school teachers on how to integrate materials-centric examples into physics, chemistry, and physical science classrooms.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), often called high-entropy alloys, are an emerging alloy class with initial evidence of exceptional mechanical properties and significant compositional design flexibility. However, the rational design of MPEAs is hindered by a lack of fundamental knowledge about the chemical short range order (SRO), which are the local correlations in the distribution of atomic species. This project will characterize the evolution of SRO in a model CrCoNi MPEA to evaluate two hypotheses; first, that SRO in MPEAs reaches a stable state that is independent of the fabrication conditions, and second, that the relaxation time to the stable SRO is governed by diffusion kinetics (which themselves depend on the SRO). Samples will be fabricated by vacuum arc melting, direct current sintering, and high-pressure torsion consolidation to generate measurably different initial SRO states. SRO characterization will be done by atom probe tomography (APT) cross-correlated with electron scattering for a pair distribution function as well as energy filtered high resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging. The APT datasets will be analyzed by a machine learning approach where the data is modeled as a sample from an underlying pairwise-interaction Markov point process. Experimental data from a series of isothermal annealing experiments will be used to calibrate a mathematical model for the mutual interactions of the SRO and the self-diffusivity. The model will be used to develop time-temperature-SRO diagrams for MPEAs to be integrated into service. The project is expected to deliver: (1) Maturation of a fundamental scientific understanding of MPEAs? compositional stability from which these materials can be deployed into service in extreme environments. (2) A robust machine learning APT analysis method that expands the technique to address high solute clustering characteristics in alloys. (3) The development of the next-generation STEM workforce at the graduate level as well as through secondary school teachers via a materials camp that instructs how to incorporate materials into the physics, chemistry, and physical science curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emphasizing critical aspects of data quality management such as accuracy, completeness, and consistency, the project aims to develop methods that significantly enhance the trustworthiness and societal impact of these systems. Incorporating causal modeling with these essential data quality principles, it takes a strategic approach to identifying and addressing the root causes of algorithmic bias.

Recently, under the context of Data Science for Social Good, some data owners are willing to share their mobility data with the public to unlock their values, but there are significant privacy concerns that remain in the way.  The key science driver behind this project is the gap between the lack of sanitized diverse mobility data access for the Science and Engineering community and the advance of generative Machine Learning and practical differential privacy. To bridge this gap, the project team builds a trustworthy cyberinfrastructure (CI) emulation tool called MobilityNet to (1) synthesize realistic mobility data based on real data, via privacy-preserving generative machine learning emphasizing MobilityNet's trustworthiness (i.e., utility, privacy, and fairness); and (2) share these data with the Science and Engineering community for multidisciplinary innovations by working with 19 partners.

A deeper understanding of these materials has the potential to pave the way for transformative advancements in next-generation electronics. In order to understand how a material performs in its intended application, it is necessary to replicate those conditions. For example, an LED emits light when electrically injected and oppositely charged carriers recombine. In this study, the PI will study perovskites using an electrical testbed on timescales less than a nanosecond and with sub-micron resolution. The project will strengthen U.S. technological leadership and cultivate the next generation of scientists and engineers, with a focus on broadening participation. The project will also foster scientific curiosity through outreach activities designed to engage K-12 students, teachers, and parents.

Solar cells now achieve power conversion efficiencies exceeding 25%, and light-emitting diodes boast internal quantum efficiencies surpassing 90%. For further advancements, a deeper understanding of fundamental charge-carrier and exciton dynamics in perovskites is essential. However, much of the literature to date has focused on understanding charge-carrier and exciton dynamics by optical excitation. Despite the many differences that electrical excitation introduces, little is known about their impacts on charge and exciton dynamics in the material. The goal of this research is to bridge this knowledge gap and investigate charge and exciton dynamics of perovskite semiconductors under electrical excitation. Specifically, the project develops an ultrafast electroluminescence testbed and study transient charge and exciton dynamics within various perovskite compositions and related perovskite/organic heterojunctions, such as free charge carrier recombination, exciton funneling and recombination processes, as well as interfacial charge-transfer state energies.

Solving polynomial equations in rational numbers dates back to Diophantus in the 3rd century and has been a central subject in mathematics for generations. The modern study of Diophantine equations has incorporated the revolutionary idea of Riemann from his use of a class of special functions called ""zeta functions? or ""L-functions"". Such special functions are built up on counting the numbers of solutions of polynomial equations in the much simpler setting of modular arithmetic. In the 1960s, Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer came up with a remarkable conjecture revealing a relation between the zeros of L-functions and the solutions to a special class of polynomial equations in the rationals. Later Beilinson and Bloch conjectured that, for general  polynomial equations in the rationals, there should always be a relation between the zeros of L-functions and algebraic cycles which are ?parameter solutions to polynomial equations?.<br/> <br/>The project will study the zeros of L-functions through automorphic forms and special cycles on modular varieties. The theory of automorphic form provides a fruitful way to access the zeros of L-functions. The modular varieties are either Shimura varieties over number fields or moduli spaces of Shtukas over function fields. They play a central role in modern number theory and arithmetic geometry, and they often come with a great supply of algebraic cycles. The project aims to prove results relating zeros of L-functions and algebraic cycles on modular varieties, including new cases of the arithmetic Gan?Gross?Prasad conjecture for Shimura varieties associated to unitary groups, certain Higher Gross?Zagier formula over function fields, and the function field analog of Kudla?s program with an emphasis on the modularity of generating series of special cycles and the arithmetic Siegel?Weil formula.

These unique properties arise from the polarizable oxide ions. An important national priority is accelerating the discovery of new compounds, especially those with more than one type of anion instead of multiple cations. These ?multi-anion? or heteroanionic materials, in which abundant elements like nitrogen or fluorine substitute for some of the oxygen ions, can enable superior functionality that is difficult to achieve in simpler oxide materials. To that end, this award supports research that will provide new knowledge about how the atomic scale structures of these materials govern their macroscopic properties. The project will establish design approaches that account for strategies to control the ordering of the different anion types. This will guide the choice of which chemical elements and atomic arrangements to use to obtain desired electronic, magnetic, and optical properties crucial for advancing current and future technologies.<br/><br/>Additionally, this award supports teaching and training students at multiple levels. The capabilities for new material discovery will be integrated into curricula to broaden participation of underrepresented students in STEM fields. The principal investigator and group members will participate in public outreach events. Undergraduate and graduate students will also gain interdisciplinary training and experiential opportunities, contributing to the development of a skilled scientific workforce. The PI will develop accessible educational materials, including low-cost high-fidelity 3D printed models to impart critical skills and improve equity for high-school students. These concerted efforts will empower students, teachers, and workers with proficiencies needed for high-tech globally competitive careers.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Heteroanionic materials, in which one uses anion substitution of inherently earth-abundant elements (N, F, etc.) into oxides, enable the design of superior functionality that remains elusive in chemically simpler homoanionic compounds. Structure-property relationships, however, are poorly developed within this nascent field, intensified by a minimal understanding of anion order-disorder effects on physical properties. The project goals are to (1) employ a heteroanionic materials design scheme to understand the interplay among local and extended crystal structure, anion order, and electronic and magnetic responses in new regimes; and to (2) advance new heteroanionic materials exhibiting cooperative phenomena superior to those found in currently available homoanionic materials. This project will pursue design and discovery using a computational strategy, which integrates phenomenological modeling, tight-binding models, ab initio simulations, and symmetry analysis with state-of-the-art electronic structure methods to build both descriptive and predictive design models. The project also leverages substantial collaborative experimentation, focusing on synthesis and structure-property characterization on predicted compounds, guided by first-principles stability and synthesizability assessments. The PI has ongoing collaborations with leading experts in multianion synthesis and characterization; understanding derived here will stimulate experimental methods and vice versa. Success in the project will benefit society by advancing a scientific framework for tuning functionality through multiple sustainable anions. These insights may contribute instrumental in the development of electrical, optical, magnetic, and quantum components for microelectronics, catering to diverse energy-efficient computing, quantum information technologies, and communication systems that serve as major drivers of U.S. economic growth and leadership.<br/><br/>This project synergistically integrates research and education to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. It develops innovative undergraduate and graduate curricula incorporating the project?s cutting-edge materials discovery capabilities.

This sequence could be highly structured - for instance, it could alternate periodically between 0 and 1.  Or it could be completely random, with the value of each member of the sequence having no relation whatsoever to the next.  It could also be ""pseudorandom"" - described by a deterministic algorithm, but yet statistically indistinguishable from a genuinely random sequence.  Or it could be some complex mixture of structure and (pseudo)randomness.  Can one define precisely what structure and randomness mean and describe arbitrary data as combinations of these two different components?  Such questions are of importance in cryptography, computer science, combinatorics, dynamics, and number theory, as they allow one to mathematically determine whether certain patterns in arbitrary streams of data are guaranteed to occur or not.  For instance, in 2004, Ben Green and the PI were able to settle a long-standing conjecture in number theory that the prime numbers contained arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, with the key idea being to break up the prime numbers into structured and random components and study the contribution of each component.  In computer science, this theory has led, for instance, to efficient ways to generate pseudorandom bits for several types of applications. In the subsequent twenty years, much progress has been made in quantifying more precisely what structure and randomness mean, particularly in the area of mathematics now known as higher-order Fourier analysis.  More understanding has been gained on the precise way in which number-theoretic structures, such as the primes, exhibit (pseudo-)random behavior at both large and small scales. There has been steady progress in this direction in recent years, in which the scale on which one is able to definitively demonstrate various types of pseudorandomness has narrowed over time, and further work will be carried out in this project, in particular, it is tantalizingly near to resolve (a version) of a well-known conjecture in number theory - the Chowla conjecture - which could be in turn a stepping stone to even more famous conjectures such as the twin prime conjecture.

Firstly, the PI will continue recent work on developing general inverse theorems for the Gowers uniformity norms in additive combinatorics on one hand and the Host--Kra uniformity seminorms in ergodic theory on the other.  Secondly, the PI will continue building upon recent breakthroughs in the understanding of multiplicative functions, to make further progress towards the (logarithmically averaged) Chowla and Elliott conjectures for such functions, and to apply these results to related problems in analytic number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turn, work on the conjecture has enriched these subjects, and in some cases completely reshaped them. <br/><br/>One particularly important example of a correspondence that should preserve automorphic representations is the automorphic tensor product. It has been known for some time that in order to establish this particular case of Langlands functoriality it suffices to prove that certain functions known as L-functions are analytically well-behaved. More recently, Braverman and Kazhdan, Ngo, Lafforgue and Sakellaridis have explained that the expected properties of these L-functions would follow if one could obtain certain generalized Poisson summation formulae.

A heart valve substitute made from living biological tissue that can self-repair and grow would provide a far superior treatment option. The overall research goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to develop a living heart valve substitute using new approaches that will overcome current barriers. For example, a new origami-inspired design is expected to achieve a valve that is easier to make and that lasts longer. Additionally, the valve will be populated with living cells in a way that is similar to how heart valves naturally form. This will allow the cells to produce a more natural valve with appropriate behavior and functionality. This CAREER project also includes education and outreach activities designed to broaden STEM participation by recruiting members from diverse groups to work on the research and to increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology by offering educational community outreach and classroom activities in libraries and middle schools. Activities include a ?Science in the News? seminar series open to the public and hosted at local public libraries and an ?Origami-based Engineering Design Challenge? outreach activity targeted towards students in local middle schools.<br/><br/>There is an urgent need to develop a tissue engineered heart valve that is both functionally durable and physiologically accurate to provide better treatment options for children born with congenital heart disease.

Objective 1 is to synthesize a porous and elastic scaffold that mimics critical tissue properties. This will be accomplished by incorporating a sodium chloride (NaCl) porogen into poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) to create a biocompatible scaffold with tissue-like porosity and elasticity. Objective 2 is to develop a prosthetic heart valve with hydrodynamic functionality and durability.

Objective 3 is to generate resident valve cell types with appropriate biological activity.  This will be accomplished by using patient-derived umbilical cord blood to generate endothelial progenitor cells which can give rise to native-like valve cell populations by mimicking embryonic development.

In the past decade, the work of the Principal Investigator (PI) and other mathematicians have led to a rigorous theory of ""quantitative homogenization"" of certain partial differential equations. These equations have some of the properties of the complex physical systems mentioned above, and the homogenization theory resembles renormalization group-type arguments in important ways. However, it currently works well only for problems with a small number of length scales. The project proposes to increase the level of sophistication of the homogenization methods until the theory can be deployed more flexibly on physical systems exhibiting critical behavior. This requires the development of new mathematical ideas and concepts and will require input from analysis, probability theory, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/> <br/>The project has two main goals. The first one concerns improving the quantitative homogenization theory, so that it is more explicit in its dependence on important parameters in the equation (like the ellipticity ratio) and allows for degenerate and possibly unbounded coefficient fields. This is a well-known open problem in the subfield, but the PI and his collaborator Kuusi have made recent progress on this question, and this project will continue to develop these new ideas. A second focus of the project is to use these analytic methods developed for homogenization as means of formalizing heuristic renormalization group arguments in physics. Such methods arise in a wide variety of contexts, but the project has a few specific problems in mind. One arises in fluid turbulence, and concerns proving the anomalous diffusion of a passive scalar advected by a rough vector field. The PI and his collaborator Vicol have made recent progress on this question by using homogenization to formalize a renormalization group argument. This points the way to further possibilities, including the construction of more physically realistic examples of anomalous diffusion. Another potential application lies in Euclidean field theory, following a stochastic quantization approach to study Gibbs measures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transition metal materials are poised to be an important component of a solar energy economy, as photocatalysts that use solar energy to formally split water, giving molecular hydrogen that can be used as fuel, for example, or to convert captured CO2 into useful chemical feedstocks.  Ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy has recently emerged as a promising experimental tool to probe the properties and function of these materials at the atomic level, but theoretical simulations are needed to interpret the results.  However, existing theoretical methods are either too expensive to address realistic materials, or else do not offer sufficient accuracy to be interpretative.  These issues will be addressed by the Herbert research group.  Computational tools developed as part of this work will be made available to the research community in widely used software packages that will also be used to modernize teaching activities, incorporating research problems into the classroom via partnership with Ohio Supercomputer Center.  A broad array of students will engage in this research, including students recruited from programs designed to broaden participation in science, such as an American Chemical Society Bridge program and an NSF-funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates program that targets students from small Rust Belt communities.<br/><br/>Chemical dynamics and materials science are in the midst of an ultrafast x-ray revolution, with new light sources allowing for time resolution ranging from 100 femtoseconds down to tens of attoseconds. These emerging experimental techniques are poised to provide unprecedented mechanistic information on myriad transition metal catalyst systems.  To complement this new generation of spectroscopies, and new set of computational tools is required. Tools developed as part of this work have the potential to connect the structure of materials to the behavior of spin and charge carriers--electrons and holes--that are probed experimentally. Accordingly, under this award, the Herbert research group will develop methods to simulate ultrafast transient x-ray experiments, and core-level spectroscopy generally, in systems containing transition metals.  Target systems include solid-state metal oxides that are promising candidates for visible band-gap photocatalysts.  A variety of new models and algorithms will be pursued, including modifications to excited-state density functional theory (DFT) that are expected to be better equipped to handle systems with an open-shell ground state, avoiding severe spin contamination.  Hybrid wavefunction/DFT methods that move beyond conventional DFT will also be pursued.  These include wavefunction-in-DFT embedding, to bring highly correlated, multi-reference  wavefunctions for spectroscopy into the solid state, thereby avoiding the need to construct and validate finite cluster models of materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like tree rings, bivalves record growth increments in their shells. Today, one of the longest-lived animals on the planet is the clam Arctica islandica, which can live for over 500 years. In addition to this species, over a dozen modern bivalves have been shown to live for over 100 years. While longevity of modern bivalves is well known because of their economic importance, very little is known about the lifespans of fossil bivalves. This work examines lifespans and growth rates of fossil bivalves to understand the phylogenetic (evolutionary relationships) and environmental controls on longevity. This project provides authentic research experiences for students at a Hispanic Serving Institution and creates workshops for current high school teachers and undergraduate students majoring in science education. The project is funded by the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology Program and the Biological Oceanography Program.<br/><br/>Life history data derived from using the tools of sclerochronology can contribute to a better understanding of macroevolutionary processes. However, the field of life history analysis applied to fossil organisms is in its infancy and much work remains to be done. This proposal will unite the fields of sclerochronology and paleobiology and lay the foundation for a new path of research. Using fossil bivalves, the three primary questions are: 1) is lifespan a heritable trait; 2) can body size trends be explained by changes in life history strategy; and 3) do latitudinal life history gradients change in alternate climate settings. The educational component of this project will: 1) modify an Invertebrate Paleontology course into a course-based undergraduate research experience; 2) run workshops for current high school teachers and undergraduate students pursuing teaching degrees; 3) create paid lab assistant positions and support attendance at national conferences for undergraduate students; and 4) increase community and K-12 student access to the Sam Houston Natural History Collections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The electron-deficient character of boron compounds allows them to reversibly interact with electron-rich compounds such as amines or phosphines through so-called dative bonding. The reversibility of this dative bonding is appealing for developing ?smart? materials because the bond formation can be controlled through changes in temperature, concentration, and other stimuli. The Jkle group aims to exploit this behavior to generate recyclable polymeric materials, including light-emitting materials that could find use in display technologies, bioimaging, and as sensors. The project will contribute to the training of a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students in a highly interdisciplinary field of research. Planned materials chemistry outreach programs will allow students from local minority-serving high schools to experience University research and learn about career opportunities in the science and technology fields, while summer internships will provide hands-on research experiences. Polymer analysis capabilities will support the training of undergraduate students in teaching laboratories and enable research at nearby universities.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Jkle group will explore the synthesis and properties of polymers that are decorated with borane Lewis acids and Lewis acid-base pairs as means to add functionality and enable new applications. In one direction, the research targets polymeric Lewis pairs with interesting photophysical, electronic, and stimuli-responsive characteristics by ?click?-like attachment of Lewis basic pi-conjugated chromophores to polymeric Lewis acids. Chromophores that contain multiple Lewis base groups are expected to lead to supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) that feature photo-active dynamic crosslinks. Polymers that combine sterically hindered borane Lewis acid and Lewis base groups, so-called ?frustrated? Lewis pairs, will be studied in the activation of small molecules.

A needs assessment conducted in Southern Colorado by Pueblo Community College (PCC) revealed that 21% of skilled positions in advanced manufacturing are unfilled due to a regional skills gap. This project at PCC addresses the demand for skilled professionals, focusing on welding education, materials testing, and pertinent industry focused certifications. Over the three-year project period PCC aims to align curriculum with industry standards, creating competency-based pathways in both welding and welding inspection through aligned American Welding Society (AWS) and American Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) qualifications. Faculty associated with the project will benefit from professional development opportunities focusing on welding and nondestructive Testing (NDT) education. This training will enable faculty and staff to prepare students for industry recognized credentials. The project targets a 5% increase in enrollment and student employment in industry-related careers. The initiative meets regional industry needs, and contributes to workforce diversity, broadening participation amongst underserved populations. This project aligns with PCC's mission to advance technical education while preparing students for high-demand careers in welding and nondestructive testing.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to prepare students with the necessary industry skills and credentialing to succeed in careers with a documented skills gap such as welding and welding inspection. This will be accomplished with the help of an advisory board of regional employers with demonstrated expertise in welding technology with an emphasis on NDT.  The advisory committee will work with program faculty to ensure that relevant skills are being taught in the classroom, and that college credentials are appropriately valued by regional industry. Students will be taking courses in NDT with input from the ASNT curriculum, which will prepare them to enter the welding industry in quality control, quality assurance and inspection.

This project aims to understand the properties of some fundamental PDE models for the diffusion of gas, the shape of liquid droplets, and electric transmission in composite materials. Many such processes exhibit an interface, where the equation becomes degenerate or singular. In the case of a model of gas diffusion through a porous medium, the interface is the set which separates the region where there is gas from the region where there is no gas. The boundary of a liquid droplet is another example of an interface. The project will investigate qualitative and quantitative properties of these interfaces, including convexity and smoothness. For a composite material, consisting of two materials with different conductivity properties, the interface is where these materials meet. The Principal Investigator (PI) will study the behavior of the electric field when one of the materials has a very thin part. This project has possible implications for material failure, an important question in Engineering. Students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained on the techniques and theory of these PDE models.<br/><br/>This project centers on four topics, connected by the themes of interfaces, degeneracies, and convexity/concavity. The porous medium equation is a nonlinear degenerate parabolic equation used to model the diffusion of gas. The PI will investigate questions of concavity and convexity of solutions and finding global optimal regularity estimates. Secondly, the PI will study linear PDE whose coefficients are discontinuous along two almost touching interfaces, a model for transmission problems and composite materials. In this setting, the PI will investigate new approaches to obtaining optimal gradient estimates in the thin region between the interfaces. A third project is to study linear equations which are parabolic on the interior on a fixed domain but are degenerate at the boundary. These equations arise as linearizations of the porous medium equation and the Gauss curvature flow. The PI will investigate optimal conditions for existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions. Finally, questions of concavity of solutions to the elliptic torsion problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions and the dynamic version of this equation, known as the quasi-static droplet model, will be studied. In addition, the PI will carry out summer research projects with undergraduates, exploring explicit solutions to these equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The settings for these problems involve geometric manifolds of dimension two or more.  Associated with a given manifold are fundamental objects called eigenfunctions.  These are the fundamental modes of vibration of the manifold, and they are the higher dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions for the circle.  Designers of musical instruments are well aware that the shape of, say, a drum or the soundboard of stringed instrument affects the basic tones that it omits, as well as the sound volume.  Similar phenomena arise for manifolds, and the PI will study precisely how their shapes, such as how they are curved, affect the properties properties of eigenfunctions.  Just as in music, one particularly expects different shapes and geometries to become more apparent in the behavior of the fundamental modes of vibration as the frequency becomes larger and larger.  These eigenfunctions are solutions of a differential equation that is similar to the wave equation, and the PI will study similar problems involving it.  The general theme is to study how solutions of wave equations are affected by their physical backgrounds, such as whether or not black holes are present or whether the background becomes very close to a vacuum near infinity. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Among the specific problems the PI shall study, they wish to obtain improved estimates that measure the size and concentration of eigenfunctions.  In order to do this, they will develop what is called ``global harmonic analysis??, which is a mixture of classical harmonic analysis, microlocal analysis, and techniques from geometry.  The basic estimates are Lp-estimates for eigenfunctions and quasimodes and related highly localized L2 estimates that are sensitive to concentration.  The main questions center around how the geometry and the global dynamics of the geodesic flow affect the estimates and the kinds of functions that saturate them.  The latter issue is closely related to the much-studied (but still not well-understood) questions of concentration, oscillation, and size properties of modes and quasimodes in spectral asymptotics.  These questions are also naturally linked to the long-time properties of the solution operator for the wave equation, Schrodinger equation, and resolvent estimates coming from the metric Laplacian.  High frequency solutions and obtaining sharp results under geometric assumptions are particularly interesting.  They will also study functions that saturate the estimates in different ways depending on the sign of the sectional curvatures of the manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The use of electric vehicles (EVs) is a major initiative to meet this clean energy goal. The challenge is a dearth of available EV automotive technology training in New Jersey and the surrounding region. Brookdale Community College, located in Monmouth County, New Jersey, will prepare a workforce trained in the service and repair of EVs by infusing EV learning into existing automotive technology programs and courses. Brookdale Community College will create a ?stackable? credential for incumbent automotive technology professionals. The new curriculum and educational materials will be disseminated to related programs across the country to broaden the impact.<br/><br/>This project will aim to recruit women who are underrepresented in automotive technology programs and careers.  To support the retention of all students, Brookdale Community College and the Automotive Technology Program will offer a series of events, workshops, and conferences led by a female automotive technology coordinator, who will serve as a leader and role model for the students. In providing open access opportunities for training in high-skill, wage, and demand EV careers, this project provides a prime opportunity to better prepare and to diversify the automotive technology workforce. Brookdale Community College will also work with Amazing Women in Automotive (AWA) to offer mentoring opportunities, establish a student club to mentor women within the automotive field, and host networking/recruitment dinners at automotive trade shows.

The study of these spaces has used methods both from algebra and from calculus (also called analysis).  Decades ago, a linkage between the algebraic and analytic approaches to geometry was established, which then led to important progress on geometric problems.  The PIs will extend this linkage to situations in which information is given only on a piece of a geometric space, rather than on the entire space.  This will make it possible to solve open problems concerning the computation of currently mysterious numerical data that relate to the behavior of geometric spaces.  The approach will involve studying spaces locally in order to gain a greater insight into their overall behavior.  The PIs will also engage in activities that have broader impacts.  These include mentoring, widening the pipeline into mathematical research for people from groups traditionally underrepresented in mathematics, and communicating mathematics to a broader audience.  In addition, graduate students supported by the award will receive training to contribute toward this research as well as to engage in further mathematical research in the future.<br/><br/>More precisely, the PIs will study an analog of Serre's GAGA theorem in the context of function fields of varieties, rather than for the varieties themselves.  This will involve a structure sheaf that contains both holomorphic functions and rational functions. A key goal will then be to use this result to compute the conjectured period-index bound for rational function fields over the complex numbers in three or more variables. The PIs also aim to prove related results over more arithmetic ground fields, by bringing in ideas from the theory of formal schemes and building on their prior work in lower dimensions.  In addition, the PIs will work to understand the structure of the absolute differential Galois group of real rational function fields.  This work is motivated by results that they previously achieved in differential Galois theory over the complex numbers and in classical Galois theory over real function fields. The methods used will include local-global principles and patching, as well as the structure theory of linear algebraic groups, Galois cohomology, and other techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite being the primary beneficiaries, students have yet to be involved in the development of learning analytics. This project adopts a student-centered framework called TEEM (Teaching to Empower) by integrating data science and data literacy education at the undergraduate level. TEEM involves designing and implementing data science and analytics educational activities where students collect, analyze, and reflect on data about their own learning, well-being, and study habits. Based on those activities, the project will design and develop ?Live Data Lab,? a hands-on, self-guided learning platform that will be accessible to a broader student community beyond data science majors. This platform will be piloted with about 500 first-year undergraduates and students enrolled in the pre-service teacher training program, at the University of Maryland Baltimore County and from community college partners. This project will enhance students? skills in data science, analytics, data literacy, and self-regulation and contribute to educating a diverse workforce with the increasingly necessary skills to understand, process, and make use of data. <br/><br/>TEEM is a research-education integrated framework that aims to engage and empower students in creating a more effective learning analytics system to enhance self-regulated learning while improving students? data science and data literacy competency. It consists of three main parts: (1) design-based research in data science courses on active-learning-based learning-analytics-themed activities leveraging students? intuitive knowledge; (2) design and development of a dual-purpose, hands-on, self-guided platform called ?Live Data Lab? to disseminate student-created, expert-reviewed learning resources; and (3) pilot studies with a diverse group of students, including 500 first-year undergraduates, pre-service teachers, and community college students. The project's impact will be assessed through quantitative measures of data literacy and self-regulation and qualitative methods, including content analysis and interviews. This project will advance knowledge in learning analytics research and data science education. The insights gained from students? involvement in the design process will inform the design of learning analytics tools that better reflect their needs. Moreover, deep involvement with their own data could lead to new ways to improve self-reflection and self-regulation. The open-source platform, teaching methods, and resources can be adapted for wider educational use, potentially benefiting students from higher education institutions, including community colleges and K-12 schools, both in formal and informal spaces.

The first topic is Donaldson-Thomas (DT) and Vafa-Witten (VW) theory, which studies the invariants of  the space parametrizing sets of solutions of polynomials defining two dimensional objects with certain topological constraints in a space. The second topic is higher dimensional  Gromov-Witten (GW) theory, which roughly speaking is about a systematic way of counting numbers of surfaces with particular constraints in a space defined by a set of polynomial equations.   For a real dimension four space, a remarkable conjecture of electromagnetic duality  (S-duality) from physics says that counting  two dimensional objects in a topological space has nice modularity properties. Different branches of mathematics are linked together by these two theories and deep properties of geometric objects have been uncovered by calculating invariants. In this project the PI will investigate the S-duality conjecture between these two theories and relate them to other branches of mathematics and physics.

Somewhat surprisingly, there are many basic theoretical problems in this area of mathematics which remain unsolved despite the many incredible successes the field has already achieved. This project studies a family of questions in the area of geometric averages which, for example, correspond to quantifying the relationship between small changes in the imaged objects and the expected changes in measured data (which in practice would be processed computationally to recover an approximate picture of the original object). The theoretical challenge in a problem such as this is to precisely quantify the notion of change and to establish essentially exact relationships between the magnitude of input and output changes. Thanks to recent advances in the PI's work to understand these objects, the project is well-positioned to yield important results. Achieving the main goals of this project would lead to advances in a number of related areas of mathematics and may influence future imaging technologies. The project furthermore provides unique opportunities for the advanced mathematical training of both undergraduate and PhD students, who can transfer these skills to other areas of critical need once in the workforce.<br/><br/>The PI studies topics in mathematical analysis related to the development of new geometric approaches to Radon-like transforms, oscillatory integrals, and Fourier restriction problems. This work includes various special cases of both sublevel set and oscillatory integral problems. Major special cases deserving mention include multiparameter sublevel set estimates, maximal curvature for Radon-like transforms of intermediate dimension, degenerate Radon transforms in low codimension, Fourier restriction and related generalized determinant functionals, and multilinear oscillatory integrals of convolution and related types. The PI's approach to these involves a variety of new tools developed within the last 5 years which incorporate techniques from Geometric Invariant Theory, geometric measure theory, decoupling theory, and other areas. Among these new tools is a recent result of the PI which provides an entirely new way to estimate norms of Radon-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities in terms of geometric quantities which can be understood as analogous to Lieb's formula for the Brascamp-Lieb constant. A major goal of this project is to understand the local geometric criteria which implicitly govern the finiteness of the nonlocal integrals appearing in the Radon-Brascamp-Lieb condition. The project has numerous potential applications to other problems of interest at the intersection of harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and incidence geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Self-similar sets are characterized by the property that they look the same at different scales. Such sets arise in the study of dynamical systems, for instance, in complex dynamics and the study of the Mandelbrot set. On the other hand, in probability theory and statistical physics one often encounters stochastically self-similar sets. Such objects only have the same statistical properties at different scales. There are surprising analogies between the probabilistic theory and its deterministic counterpart. The research supported by this award explores these analogies and addresses foundational questions regarding self-similar objects, using methods from complex analysis. The project also provides opportunities for the training and mentoring of junior researchers, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The PI will contribute to the dissemination of mathematical knowledge through the organization of conferences, workshops, and summer schools.<br/><br/>Research to be conducted under this award involves the geometry of conformally self-similar structures, both in stochastic and deterministic settings. Julia sets for the iteration of complex mappings illustrate the latter setting, while the former includes topics such as Schramm-Loewner evolution. The project aims to answer fundamental regularity questions for conformally self-similar objects, including Jordan curves of finite Loewner energy. A new parametrization of the Teichmueller spaces of punctured spheres will also be studied. Additional motivation for the project arises from the interaction between the deterministic and stochastic frameworks, notably, the transfer of methods and results between these two areas. For instance, the concept of conformal mating of polynomials in complex dynamics bears close similarity to Sheffield's mating of trees construction for random spheres. The PI?s research uses methods developed in complex dynamics to provide analytic constructions for random structures. Conversely, insights from the probabilistic theory translate to new research avenues in complex dynamics. Conformal welding is a tool of central importance in both theories, and the proposal aims to resolve several fundamental questions regarding Weil-Petersson curves, welding of Liouville Quantum Gravity discs, and Werner's conformal restriction measure on Jordan curves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these equations have been studied for many decades, much remains to be understood about the dynamics of solutions. This project will focus on deriving theoretical results in one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas of study: singularity formation. Roughly, singularities are infinities that can develop in solutions, making the equations exceptionally challenging to study. Such infinities lie at the crux of some of the most fascinating physical phenomena. Outstanding examples include Big Bangs in general relativity, where the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite, and shock waves in compressible fluids, where pressure gradients become infinitely large. The results of the project will shed deep new insights into the laws of nature. The PI will integrate education, research, and scientific training by incorporating undergraduates, Master?s degree students, PhD students, and postdoctoral scholars into the research program.<br/><br/>The PI aims to prove novel stable blowup-results in multidimensions for solutions to the Cauchy problem for the PDE systems mentioned above, which are quasilinear and hyperbolic in character. For compressible Euler flow, the goal is to prove shock-formation, with an eye towards understanding the global structure of the largest possible classical solution, i.e, the Maximal Globally Hyperbolic Development (MGHD). There are currently no results on the global structure of the MGHD, and such results are essential for proving the uniqueness of classical solutions with shocks. For the viscous fluid models, there are currently no constructive blowup-results, so any constructive singularity-formation result would be the first of its kind. For Einstein?s equations (coupled to various matter models), the goal is to understand the structure and stability of spacetime singularities, with a focus on techniques that are localizable and robust, thus allowing one to probe new solution regimes. In all of the problems, gauge choices motivated by geometric and analytical considerations lie at the heart of the analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first goal is to develop a better understanding of the opportunities and challenges around introducing robots into a set of common types of construction tasks including material handling, assembly, and inspection. The team will work closely with both construction experts and workers to develop plausible construction scenarios involving robots, then analyze the HRI/C challenges that arise in them, to create a taxonomy of skills as well as a model of acceptance of these technologies by both individual workers and companies. The second goal is to develop methods for modeling skill training and acquisition around a subset of those HRI/C scenarios and skills, choosing ones that are most practically and scientifically promising to study.

Polyploidy was discovered over 100 years ago, but our understanding remains limited, even though nearly all agricultural crops are polyploid, many human organs (for example, liver, heart, and placenta) are polyploid, and at least one-third of all cancers are polyploid.  A common theme is that polyploidy is often associated with stress, but few other generalities have emerged, in part because researchers across diverse fields?from cell biology to genomics, agriculture, cancer, and ecology?rarely interact.  The Polyploidy Integration and Innovation Institute will bring a unique, synthetic approach to the study of polyploidy, with integrated analyses that will uncover both the commonalities and distinct roles of polyploidy in cells to ecosystems and in plants, animals, and fungi.  A coordinated research plan across carefully selected biological systems will serve as a framework for predictive models that will extend the experimental work more broadly, with important consequences for agriculture, medicine, conservation of biodiversity, and development of the bioeconomy.  Moreover, the Institute will transform scientific understanding of polyploidy and its relevance for society through integration of research, cross-disciplinary education and training, public outreach, and programs to diversify the scientific workforce.  <br/><br/>Polyploidy occurs at the levels of cells, tissues, organs, and entire organisms and ultimately results in transformative downstream effects that occur across biological scales and diverse organisms.  Nucleotypic effects of increased ploidy (that is, effects due to increased DNA content alone) may impact cell size, gene expression, gene interaction networks, protein production, and more, producing a mosaic of potential positive and negative outcomes.  Explanations for the advantages and constraints of polyploid cells and organisms remain elusive, in part because broad-scale comparisons have not been made.  The Polyploidy Integration and Innovation Institute will conduct coordinated research in yeast, Arabidopsis, duckweed, Chlamydomonas, and fruit flies to test the central hypothesis that there are underlying rules to polyploidy that act across levels of biological organization and organismal systems.  Parallel experiments across these model systems will test specific hypotheses about the common impact of nucleotypic effects across systems and whether the rules that determine polyploid success at the cellular and organismal levels ultimately scale to populations and landscapes.  This novel predictive and quantitative framework for the cellular, organismal, evolutionary, and ecosystem-level consequences of polyploidy has not previously been possible because research on polyploidy has been siloed.  Collaborations with the broader scientific community will extend this research paradigm to many other lineages of life.  The inherently interdisciplinary nature of polyploidy is reflected in a training program that is integrated with the Institute?s conceptual research framework and emphasizes experimental and analytical methods as well as skills in team science, data science, and science communication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in biomedical diagnosis, this direct contact can cause irritation, resulting in discomfort. As a scientific research tool, direct contact often leads to pollution of samples or inconvenience in operation. To address these issues, this project aims to develop integrated non-contact ultrasound generation and detection systems capable of achieving high-resolution and highly specified detection and imaging for biological functional imaging and biomechanical characterization. The developed non-contact systems can provide the scientific research and biomedical community with a very useful tool for specific biochemical and functional observations at a very small scale. The developed systems can also offer the tissue engineering community a non-contact and non-destructive method for characterizing the mechanical properties of their developed tissues. This project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and will promote the engagement and interest of high school students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through its outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop and validate systems that integrate broadband ultrasound generation using both photoacoustic and air-coupled ultrasound techniques. These systems will incorporate a compact fiber optic Sagnac interferometer capable of multiband detection to accommodate different spatial resolution requirements and enable the detection of transverse ultrasound waves for biomechanical characterization of biological tissues. The integration of these non-contact ultrasound generation and detection techniques will enable non-contact tissue functional imaging with optical resolution, as well as non-contact biomechanical characterization of tissues. The research plan represents the first systematic study exploring the potential applications of a compact fiber optic Sagnac interferometer in biological tissue imaging. The compact fiber optic Sagnac interferometer could become a powerful, affordable, and attractive tool for enhancing biomedical diagnosis and research, offering improved accuracy and non-contact capabilities. Additionally, for the first time, this project investigates the feasibility of using the compact fiber optic Sagnac interferometer for multiband non-contact photoacoustic signal detection in biological tissue, particularly, in the ultra-high-frequency range, up to 400MHz. Success in this endeavor could replace the current expensive piezo-based single transducer in high-frequency ultrasound detection. Furthermore, the research plan introduces non-contact air-coupled ultrasound-induced transverse waves to evaluate cardiovascular path biomechanical properties, opening doors for engineered tissue mechanical characterization using this proposed non-contact ultrasound generation and detection technique.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First by Bidone in Turin in 1826, and then famously by Russell in 1834 who followed a hump of water moving at constant speed along a channel for several miles. Today these objects are known as solitons. Lying at the intersection of mathematics and physics, they have been studied rigorously since the 1960s. For completely integrable wave equations, many properties of solitons are known, such as their elastic collisions, their stability properties, as well as their role as building blocks in the long-time description of waves. The latter is particularly important, as it for example predicts how waves carrying information decompose into quantifiable units. In quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and material science, these mathematical tools allow for a better understanding of the movement of electrons in various media.

Self-assembly is a process by which nanometer-scale ?building blocks? spontaneously associate into multi-unit structures, which underlies structure formation of a vast range of useful materials structures in the biological and synthetic world.  This project aims to advance our basic understanding of an emerging ?class? of such systems, known as geometrically-frustrated assemblies (GFAs).  <br/><br/>Geometric-frustration occurs when the shape and interaction between building-blocks lead to ?misfitting? arrangements when they aggregate.  Such frustrated building blocks are not unlike warped puzzle pieces that fit neatly together edge to edge, but whose shape misfit requires more and more straining to piece together larger and larger patches of the puzzle.   In the assemblies of these nanoscale ?misfits? ? composed of polymers, proteins, or colloidal particles ? frustration can give rise to new mechanisms for the assembly process to ?sense its size?, which are not possible in assemblies without shape misfit.  The buildup of shape misfit in GFAs is related to a unique behavior known as self-limiting assembly, in which the self-assembly process can autonomously and robustly terminate at a finite number of building blocks, which itself may be predetermined based on properties of the sub-unit shape, interactions and flexibility.  As such, GFAs pose a potential pathway to engineer new types of self-assembling systems, whose finite sizes can be ?programmed? from the design and synthesis of building block properties.  Realizing the ability to engineer the self-limiting size of material assemblies through programmed frustration may reveal potentially transformative, bottom-up pathways to fabricate functional nanostructured material architectures, such as injectable biomedical scaffolds or paintable photonic coatings, with the complexity and size control that is currently only accessible via top-down techniques like 3D printing or lithography.<br/><br/>Capitalizing on this potential requires an understanding of the basic principles that connect the properties of nanoscale, frustrated building blocks (e.g. their shape misfit, interactions, flexibility) as well as the impacts of various types of disorder on the emergent structures they form on size scales much bigger than those subunits.  This project will develop theoretical frameworks that address this core objective and facilitate the translations of theoretical principles to experimental study of synthetic and biological systems.<br/><br/>Beyond potential impacts on materials science deriving from advancing the principles of GFA, the project will achieve several additional broader impacts.  These include the training and mentorship of students (undergraduate and graduate) and a postdoctoral researcher in statistical and computational approaches to materials physics, as well as efforts of the PI to advance participation of K12 student populations from under-resourced communities in graduate student-led STEM outreach and education.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research, computation, and associated education to investigate Geometrically-frustrated assembly (GFA). GFA is an emerging paradigm in which the local misfits between soft matter ?building blocks? give rise to intra-domain stress gradients on size scales that far exceed the block dimensions.   The accumulation of long-range stresses in GFA underlies a range of scale-dependent behaviors without counterpart in canonical assemblies without frustration, including the existence of a self-limiting state where the equilibrium assembly dimensions are finite, yet much larger than subunits themselves.  Recent efforts aim to capitalize on this phenomenon as a means to program the mesoscopic size and morphology of self-assembled structures through the engineered misfit of synthetic building blocks, fabricated for example through state-of-the-art colloidal synthesis or DNA nanotechnology approaches.  Meeting this challenge requires predictive understanding that traces microscopic features of GFA ? misfit shape, interactions, and deformability ? onto the finite-temperature assembly behavior that emerges at the mesoscale.  <br/><br/>Research in this project will address three critical gaps in the theoretical understanding of and engineering principles for GFA:  I) the statistical physics of frustration escape to bulk assembly via both elastic (shape-flattening) and inelastic (defect-mediated) modes; II) the ability to extend the propagation of self-limiting stress by engineering floppy modes in frustrated assembly; and III) the behaviors of mixed and polydisperse frustration assemblies.  The proposed aims to advance a range of modeling approaches to capture the intrinsically multiscale nature of GFA behavior.  Scientific impacts of this research are further advanced through collaborations with experimentalists studying both existing GFA systems as well as those targeting ?GFA by design"".<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, situations involving exploratory search, brainstorming, and complex decision-making require a conversation with both sides actively engaged. This project will develop an intelligent conversational agent that can not only reactively answer questions but also conduct two-way, proactive conversations, brainstorm with the user, generate new insights from the ongoing conversation, and make novel contributions to the shared dialogue.<br/><br/>Such an intelligent conversational agent will be built on an offline hierarchical model-based deep reinforcement learning framework.

It will allow the agent to dynamically detect and determine when to chime in to take the conversation to a novel path, enriching knowledge and topics, managing multi-tiered task objectives, and assessing potential opportunities and pitfalls to propose proactive responses. This novel approach will also include state tracking and modeling that will incorporate an understanding of the conversational environmental model, proactive action planning to expand the current conversational task's knowledge and topics and proposes potential actions, as well as critiquing and validating the proposed responses that will help recognize opportunities and pitfalls to empower proactive intelligence. Evaluation of the system will involve both objective and subjective measures at the project's different phases. During the validation phase, offline experiments with existing datasets will be performed to assess and fine-tune the new learning framework. This will be followed by the crowdsourcing phase for generating ground truth and evaluating novelty and appropriateness of the conversations. Finally, the user studies phase will evaluate the system's effectiveness, as well as user experience and task performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large-scale pre-trained models, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), also confront fairness issues, further intensifying the need to address societal biases in automated decision-making algorithms. However, the resource-intensive nature of obtaining annotated data for fair algorithms, and the significant computational challenges in debiasing large-scale models, presents substantial obstacles to achieving algorithmic fairness. In response, this project aims to pioneer fundamental research in fair algorithmic decision-making while alleviating the heavy demands on data annotation and computational resources. Ultimately, it will facilitate the development, adoption, and evaluation of fair artificial intelligence (AI) systems by humans. This project will result in novel algorithms and software, fostering broader study in real-world applications such as promoting health equity in Alzheimer's disease research. Moreover, this project prioritizes education and diversity by providing training opportunities for underrepresented minority students, engaging them in cutting-edge computational research.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to improve fair decision-making in a more efficient and flexible manner. It addresses three fundamental research challenges: 1) establishing a theoretically grounded framework for learning and evaluating fair representations using widely accessible unlabeled data; 2) learning unsupervised fair representation applicable to various downstream tasks for improved flexibility; 3) exploring an efficient strategy tailored for transformers to achieve fairness in large-scale pre-trained models without the need of retraining, thereby enhancing the trade-off between fairness and accuracy while concurrently improving computational and GPU memory efficiency. One important application of this project lies in health equity, particularly in addressing biased predictions in disease studies. By integrating rigorous theoretical analysis with emerging application studies, this research project contributes to the advancement of more equitable and effective AI for societal benefits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With advances in artificial intelligence and computing technology, and the growing importance of data analytics, the nature of many jobs is transforming. Estimates suggest that 35% of all STEM jobs now reside outside traditional STEM sectors, spanning fields such as retail, health administration, and agriculture. Therefore, to address the national imperative of building a capable and diverse STEM workforce, it is critical that we broaden the scope of STEM education to these adjacent disciplines. However, this undertaking is non-trivial and poses numerous challenges across academic, curricular, cultural, and institutional dimensions. This project takes a comprehensive approach to overcoming these challenges. By crafting tailored learning pathways, the project aims to equip students in targeted disciplines with data and computation skills essential for their specific fields, enabling them to pursue STEM concentrations and rewarding careers in an ever-changing job market. The far-reaching impact of this project is underscored by its potential to positively influence over 5,000 students currently enrolled in the targeted disciplines, with 43.4% identifying as Hispanic and an additional 12.3% representing other Historically Underrepresented Minority (HURM) groups. It is expected that the successful implementation of the STEM concentrations coupled with recruiting efforts will attract more students to these disciplines, further amplifying the impact. Sustainability measures and collaboration with various organizations will ensure that the proposed transformations become part of the educational ecosystem at Texas State University. Rapid dissemination of research results, open sharing of instructional material, and community building activities will serve as a catalyst for implementation of similar transformation projects at other HSIs. This ripple effect promises to elevate STEM education nationwide.<br/><br/>This project describes a flexible, scalable and sustainable approach that combines multiple evidence- based strategies for comprehensive and systematic integration of computing and data competencies in 15 majors across three STEM-adjacent disciplines. The contextualized learning pathways that will be created in this project are underpinned by the theoretical framework of expectancy-value theory (EVT). The introduction to programming course for non-majors is re-envisioned as a multi-contextualized offering that incorporates flipped pedagogy and active learning components. Discipline-specific computing and data competencies are infused into the curriculum using an innovative module-driven approach. The project complements curricular interventions with contextualized and engaging pedagogical practices and STEM identity building initiatives. The research endeavors in the project seeks to evaluate how experiences with modular bridging curriculum in data and computation, pedagogies of engagement, and STEM identity cohorts can impact Hispanic student retention in STEM-adjacent disciplines, and their sense of belonging and identity in STEM. The research will create new knowledge about institutional STEM capacity building at HSIs, engaged student learning, and efficacy of contextualized learning pathways in recruiting underrepresented groups in STEM and improving their persistence, retention and graduation rates. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the existing neural hardware solutions exhibit an alarmingly low energy efficiency, due to which their deployment in resource-constrained edge devices is highly challenging. This research aims at addressing the hardware needs for future AI platforms by developing design solutions that push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art to deliver significant enhancements in the energy efficiency and scalability. This will be achieved by utilizing the unique properties of ferroelectric semiconductors (FeS) amenable to neural computing and designing ultra-low power circuits and architectures based on them. The proposed energy efficient design techniques will enable the development of AI hardware capable of processing neural workloads on the edge and therefore, will make a positive impact on critical applications such as computer aided diagnosis, robotics, speech/face recognition, data classification etc. This will directly benefit several areas such as healthcare, defense, and security, among others. Further, the project will utilize the research outcomes to enhance the graduate curriculum and will promote the participation of undergraduate and minority students in the proposed research to introduce them to the field of AI based on emerging technologies.<br/><br/>A pressing need for next-generation computing is to meet the humungous data processing needs of future AI workloads, for which computing-in-memory (CiM) shows an immense promise. However, existing CiM techniques are plagued by huge energy/area overheads of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), limited scalability of memory technologies and device-circuit non-idealities. This project aims to overcome these challenges at various levels of design abstraction to achieve a systemic improvement in area- and energy-efficiencies and computational robustness. The material-level exploration will include experimental and first-principles studies of Indium Selenide (In2Se3) - a unique 2D material with ferroelectric and semiconducting properties, which makes it suitable for both compute and memory functionalities. At the device level, fabrication of FeS-based devices coupled with their phase-field modeling will be carried out to design compute-amenable non-volatile memory devices. At the circuit level, FeS-based multi-level synaptic crossbar macros, (near)-ADC-less designs and fault-tolerant CiM will be investigated to achieve compact, robust and energy efficient solutions. At the architecture level, hierarchical deep neural network (DNN) architectures optimized for CiM and featuring hardware-training co-design will be developed for ultra-low power operation along with high inference accuracy.

As a result, these polymers can spontaneously arrange themselves to produce dense arrays of nanoscale periodic structures with spacings of ~10?100 nm. These materials are useful in a range of nanoscale technologies, including the manufacture of integrated circuits and porous membranes for filtration or separation. This proposal explores a type of block copolymer called a Janus multiblock bottlebrush copolymer, in which the molecules consist of a backbone to which sidechains of three or more different polymer compositions are attached. These materials self-assemble into nanoscale structures with unusual morphologies such as layers of mesh-like structures, which cannot be formed from common block copolymers, making the Janus polymers interesting for nanomanufacturing. The proposal has two major aims: first, testing hypotheses about the formation of novel morphologies, and second, introducing a metal-containing group into the polymer to enable the formation of useful nanostructures such as microelectronic metallization wires. Success in reaching these goals will contribute to solving longstanding needs in nanofabrication based on self-assembly; in particular, the fabrication of metallic meshes and rectilinear nanostructures. Broader impacts include training of students, public events, and outreach activities to promote diversity in science and engineering.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This proposal explores a class of Janus multiblock bottlebrush copolymers that microphase- separate to form structures with hierarchical length scales consisting of a substructure within a superstructure such as mesh-in-lamella. The morphologies of Janus bottlebrush multiblock copolymers differ qualitatively from those of Janus bottlebrush diblock copolymers and the role of the confinement of the molecules within the superstructure on the substructure assembly will be investigated both experimentally and computationally. Furthermore, the proposal develops methods to incorporate a block consisting of metal-containing N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) via a poly(NHC metallopolymer) branched macromonomer route, facilitating the selective introduction of metal species within the block copolymer. Thin film morphologies and directed self-assembly of Janus bottlebrush multiblock copolymers will be investigated using solvent annealing combined with structural analysis, and metal nanostructures such as meshes will be fabricated. The proposed research will broaden the range of self-assembled morphologies obtainable from block copolymer self-assembly, as well as extending the utility of bottlebrush copolymers by introducing a metal-containing block. Morphologies relevant to semiconductor device fabrication will form a particular focus of this project. A graduate student and undergraduates including summer researchers from a local community college will be trained in an interdisciplinary field with the opportunity to interact with a computational collaborator. The results will be incorporated into classroom teaching and seminars and will be organized and archived for public access. The senior researchers and students will engage in public outreach and promotion of diversity through various programs.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The integration of smart capabilities such as actuating, sensing, and energy-harvesting is expected to transform passive interfaces into smart adaptive interfaces, that can assist people with disabilities, automate domestic tasks, and power millions of ubiquitous computers. While the complete replacement of all legacy interfaces with smart devices is not currently feasible and may lead to significant environmental impacts, augmenting them is a promising approach to cost-effectively reconfiguring daily interfaces. Yet, many end users, e.g., caretakers, building managers, even individuals who are interested in home-automation, overlook opportunities to innovate unique life patterns and styles via computation. Daily design issues can be difficult to notice because of familiarity based on prior experiences. Even for users with a specific goal, e.g., reducing utility bills, adopting the latest scientific advances in real-life demands expertise because end-user support tools are lacking. This project aims to (1) increase end-users? awareness about daily design opportunities using three-dimensional (3D) printed augmentations, enabling (2) capturing critical fabrication parameters for complex augmentations with efficiency and accuracy, and (3) fabricating smart augmentations with minimal to no barriers across multiple application domains. Provided with the libraries and toolkits for fabrication and (re)programming, end-users are allowed to tackle known modular-programming strategies, such as mix-and-match, unit-testing, model-view-controller (MVC) model, and fork the existing augmentations to repurpose them.<br/><br/>Tackling multifaceted, interdisciplinary approaches across Digital Fabrication, End-user Programming, Deep Learning, Robotics, and Design, this project lays the foundation for a future where every individual creates daily innovations in assistive computing devices, smart homes, and green buildings. This project will center around three main research objectives. Firstly, a theoretical framework will be formulated to conceptualize physical interfaces using a data-driven approach. The investigator will augment and expand massive image dataset of daily objects presented with part level segmentation, by characterizing their interaction properties and user context to help understand the reconfiguration needs, interaction barriers, and adaptive/desired interactions. Secondly, novel computational techniques will be developed to capture physicality: parts of interest (POI), dimensions of interest (DOI), and motions of interest (MOI), which are critical parameters to augment passive interfaces distilling smart capabilities. Lastly, integrating the dataset and techniques, a modular fabrication pipeline will be developed along with a composable construction toolkit and libraries of smart augmentations, establishing capture?customize/fabricate--(re)program paradigm. Through educational objectives, this project advances teacher and student education, training, and learning computing, and promotes multi-disciplinary conversations via the Texas Human-Computer Interaction  (TxHCI) seminar series.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Virtualization and service-based applications demand advanced functionalities, particularly load balance (LB), while the requesters and servers are dynamically moving between physical hosts at uncompromising line rates. <br/><br/>Very recently, using programmable PISA hardware, this team was able to design a load-balancing switch, QLB, that can distribute and load-balance load groups with a general weighted-cost multi-path (WCMP) scheme while concurrently forwarding to the network?s data plane at the total line rate of the hardware. It also has today's production-scale path and application cardinality, overcoming limitations of the software-based LBs or early PISA realizations. The project aims to develop a prototype of this WCMP load balancing switch that is deployable at Sci. DC. In conjunction with smart NICs, this smart switch will be ready to offer load balancing from inside the network in multiple modalities. If successful, this technology will significantly remove the delay and scalability limitations associated with the current generation software-based load balancing in campus Sci. DCs.  It will also provide early insight into security, configuration, and maintenance issues related to deploying and operating programmable switches. In line with the goals of the CC* program, this will directly contribute towards coordinated campus-level cyberinfrastructure improvements, innovation, integration, and engineering for science applications and distributed research projects. The project will provide novel exposure to programmable cyberinfrastructure - the first for Kent?s Campus IT teams and many other campuses.

These systems can assist human operators but can now also independently perform specific surgical tasks. This capability has changed the paradigm of how surgical team members physically and cognitively interact with each other and the technology. Specifically, the requirements for task-relevant cognitive and interpersonal skills on surgical teams have undergone significant changes, where considerations of team interactions are not just the interactions among people but also the interactions with surgical robots as a team member. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to establish a fundamental understanding of how the interactions and relationships among clinicians with future robotic teammates will change, and what are the cognitive and interpersonal skills needed, to facilitate safe and effective robotic surgeries.<br/><br/>To meet this goal, this project aims to (1) establish skills metrics for surgical robotic teams through sensor-based measures of behavior and physiology; (2) define and test human-human and human-robot surgical teams? cognitive and interpersonal skills during different interaction requirements and levels of automation; and (3) develop and evaluate a decision-making aid for improved skills among the robotic surgical team to increase work efficiency. A series of qualitative and quantitative research methods will be completed, with the integrated participation from clinicians and trainees from engineering and medicine. This project considers task, worker, and operational outcomes to improve the safety and effectiveness in surgery, which can be adapted and expanded to other high-stakes, high-stress clinical environments.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Human-Centered Computing (HCC) program in CISE/IIS and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, the role of causality in machine learning (ML) has been understood through ML solutions' over-reliance on correlations, resulting in lack of generalizability. To tackle this problem, researchers train models with data from multiple environments to extract features that are useful across domains. Other studies suggested that the causal relations between features can be leveraged to train robust models that generalize. However, unlike these ML methods that can use any collection of datasets, most of the existing causal discovery algorithms rely heavily on the assumption that we have access to interventional data, such as those from a randomized controlled trial. In practice, the datasets from different environments may carry common causal knowledge, but not necessarily arise due to well-defined interventions. Methods to systematically extract such common causal knowledge across domains from data are currently missing. This prevents ML solutions from leveraging causal structure explicitly. The goal of this project is to address this gap by developing novel algorithms that can extract cause-effect relations from unstructured, diverse datasets. The project outcomes are expected to unlock the potential of causal reasoning for data-rich domains with access to data from different environments and are expected to significantly widen the use of causal discovery among ML practitioners. <br/><br/>Specifically, in the first thrust the investigator will characterize the fundamental limits of how much causal knowledge can be extracted from diverse datasets under minimal assumptions about the data generating process. In the second thrust, with his team, he will develop causal discovery algorithms to achieve these fundamental limits from such diverse datasets. In the final thrust, the proposed discovery algorithms will be evaluated across a wide range of datasets through the performance on downstream ML tasks that they enable through the learned causal structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most of these systems are reactive. They only respond to what a user asks explicitly. In doing so, they rely on the user asking the right question, which disadvantages those with low information literacy. In addition, situations involving exploratory search, brainstorming, and complex decision-making require a conversation with both sides actively engaged. This project will develop an intelligent conversational agent that can not only reactively answer questions but also conduct two-way, proactive conversations, brainstorm with the user, generate new insights from the ongoing conversation, and make novel contributions to the shared dialogue.<br/><br/>Such an intelligent conversational agent will be built on an offline hierarchical model-based deep reinforcement learning framework. This algorithmic framework's hierarchical design will provide high-level conversation strategies and the actual utterance generation. It will allow the agent to dynamically detect and determine when to chime in to take the conversation to a novel path, enriching knowledge and topics, managing multi-tiered task objectives, and assessing potential opportunities and pitfalls to propose proactive responses. This novel approach will also include state tracking and modeling that will incorporate an understanding of the conversational environmental model, proactive action planning to expand the current conversational task's knowledge and topics and proposes potential actions, as well as critiquing and validating the proposed responses that will help recognize opportunities and pitfalls to empower proactive intelligence. Evaluation of the system will involve both objective and subjective measures at the project's different phases. During the validation phase, offline experiments with existing datasets will be performed to assess and fine-tune the new learning framework. This will be followed by the crowdsourcing phase for generating ground truth and evaluating novelty and appropriateness of the conversations.

Computers currently convey images to blind users via simple text descriptions, which does not allow users to form their own interpretations. This project seeks to enhance the quality of life for blind people by introducing the concept of audiohaptic dioramas, which allows users to learn what things look like in a way similar to real life: by exploring objects' three-dimensional structure via touch, gleaning physical details such as depth, shape, and material. Audiohaptic dioramas will work with everyday touchscreens, allowing blind users to touch or point at an image and sense its physical details via intuitive audio and haptic cues. This technology will give blind people greater access to images, films, video games, virtual reality, and the Web. The investigator will partner with leading technology companies to make audiohaptic dioramas available on mainstream consumer apps. The project's educational component will make K-12 textbooks accessible to blind students by supplementing printed images with audiohaptic dioramas. It will also train blind students to become technology designers, a field hard to enter without sight, catalyzing future efforts to make technology more inclusive.<br/><br/>This research program advances a decades-long problem in accessibility research: understanding how to make images equivalently accessible to blind users. Through the concept of audiohaptic dioramas, this research will contribute the first techniques for conveying physical details of three-dimensional scenes via sound and haptics in a way that is compatible with everyday touchscreen devices. The research program will follow a user-centered design and evaluation process to ensure that blind users? needs are met, involving blind community and lab members throughout and partnering with blind-serving organizations. This project will lead to several scientific contributions: (1) a framework for conveying still images? depth, shape, material, and color intuitively via sound and haptics on a per-pixel basis as users explore them on a touchscreen; (2) techniques for enabling blind people to independently perform everyday visual tasks such as navigation, finding a building entrance, or finding a specific color shirt using their smartphone camera or smartglasses; and (3) techniques for enabling blind people to visualize interactive virtual environments from video games and virtual reality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research aims to experimentally and computationally investigate the kinetic energy transduction, non-statistical dynamic effects, and cascade reactivity in consecutive mechanoactivation events across multiple coupled mechanophores. The project lies at the interface of physical organic, polymer, and computational chemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of next-generation scientists at all levels.

Because the application of force significantly lowers the reaction barrier, dynamic effects are potentially much more common but rarely explored in mechanochemistry. The proposed research seeks to fill a knowledge gap in understanding how different molecular parameters influence the extent dynamic effects and control of mechanochemical reactivity of covalent bonds.

Conformal mappings are planar transformations which locally preserve angles. An important example is the Mercator projection in cartography, used to project the surface of the Earth to a two-dimensional map. More recently, much attention has been devoted to the study of quasiconformal mappings, a generalization of conformal mappings where a controlled amount of angle distortion is permitted. Because of this additional flexibility, quasiconformal mappings have proven over the years to be of fundamental importance in a wide variety of areas of mathematics and applications. Many of these applications involve planar transformations that are quasiconformal inside a given region except possibly for some exceptional set of points inside the region. The study of this exceptional set leads to the notion of removability, central to this research project and closely related to fundamental questions in complex analysis, dynamical systems, probability and related areas. Another focus of this project is on the study of certain families of quasiconformal mappings called holomorphic motions. The principal investigator will study how quantities such as dimension and area change under holomorphic motions, leading to a better understanding of the geometric properties of quasiconformal mappings. The project also provides opportunities for the training and mentoring of early career researchers, including graduate students. In addition, the principal investigator will continue to be involved in a science and mathematics outreach program for local high school students.<br/><br/>Two strands of research comprise the planned work. The first component involves the study of conformal removability. Motivated by the long-standing Koebe uniformization conjecture, the principal investigator will investigate the relationship between removability and the rigidity of circle domains. This part of the project also involves the study of conformal welding, a correspondence between planar Jordan curves and functions on the circle. Recent years have witnessed a renewal of interest in conformal welding along with new generalizations and variants, notably in the theory of random surfaces and in connection with applications to computer vision and numerical pattern recognition. The second component of the project concerns holomorphic motions. The principal investigator will study the variation of several notions of dimension under holomorphic motions. A new approach to this topic by the principal investigator and his collaborators using inf-harmonic functions has already yielded a unified treatment of several celebrated theorems about quasiconformal mappings, and many more fruitful connections are anticipated as progress continues to be made towards a better understanding of holomorphic motions. This part of the project also involves the relationship between global quasiconformal dimension and conformal dimension.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These spaces are equipped with internal symmetries encoded in representations of quantum loop groups. Thanks to these symmetries, the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties is extremely rich and connected with many areas of mathematics. A better understanding of the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties will lead to new results in representation theory, algebraic geometry, number theory, combinatorics and theoretical physics.

The Arctic polar vortex is highly variable; sometimes it is weak and distorted while other times it is strong. Vortex strength is known to impact weather in the troposphere and variability in the mesosphere, thermosphere, and ionosphere. The state of the polar vortex is predictable up to two weeks in advance, so knowledge of the vortex state may increase predictability in other regions of the atmosphere, including the ionosphere.  The ionosphere is critical for both communication and navigational signals; when the ionosphere is disturbed these signals are disrupted.  In this work, the investigators will use the state of the polar vortex to explain thermospheric neutral winds, composition, and the state of the ionosphere at northern midlatitudes. Training of a high-school student at University of Colorado, Boulder and several undergraduates through Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program at MIT, Haystack Observatory is envisioned.<br/><br/>It is known that polar vortex impacts on the thermosphere and ionosphere are modulated by vortex strength. At one extreme, the polar vortex is weak and is associated with Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs). Extensive observational and modeling studies of weak vortex states have elucidated the changes in thermospheric temperature, wind, wave amplitudes, composition, and ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC), along with the mechanisms driving these changes. In contrast, relatively little is known about thermospheric and ionospheric impacts during strong polar vortices. The work seeks to address the impacts of strong polar vortex on ionospheric electron densities, thermospheric composition, and winds. The team will also explore if ionospheric electron density changes are driven primarily by composition, neutral winds, or electric fields during such events. This study will use superposed epoch analysis, empirical models, and case studies of moderate and strong vortex states, leveraging observations of winds from Fabry Perot interferometers, ionospheric parameters from GNSS TEC, incoherent scatter radars, and ionosondes, and satellite observations of thermospheric composition.

In particular, the latter aspect of the project is directly in service of the development of post-quantum cryptography, namely, cryptography which will be secure against the eventual development of quantum computers to scale.  The project will support the training of graduate students, as well as the Experimental Mathematics Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder, which aims to broaden undergraduate participation in mathematical research, including students who will go on to many roles in society.  It will also support the Numberscope project, which is an outreach project aimed at scientists, artists and the general public.<br/><br/>In the first branch of research, the PI studies certain families of integers which arise in orbits of thin groups.  Group orbits of various kinds have been studied throughout the history of number theory, including for example points on elliptic curves (upon which much of modern cryptography is based) and Pythagorean triples.  The orbits studied in this project come from a class of groups (thin groups) for which effective tools are harder to create.  These arise, for example, from the study of continued fractions.  However, one expects certain high-level phenomena to occur in both the old and new settings.  One such example is local-to-global phenomena, where the PI will study the extent to which knowledge of local information (with respect to individual primes) controls global information (the integers in the orbit).  The second aspect of the project concerns cryptographic applications of number theory.  One of the current candidates for post-quantum cryptography is isogeny-based cryptography, which is based on elliptic curves.  The security of mathematical public-key cryptography is based on hard problems, and the hard problems of isogeny-based cryptography demand scrutiny as part of the development and eventual deployment (or breaking) of such schemes.  This project studies the difficulty of these underlying hard problems, namely the path-finding and endomorphism ring problems for supersingular isogeny graphs, by studying the graphs themselves.

This project focuses on the exploration and characterization of new hydrogen resources in the United States, and innovative education and workforce developments to meet the demand for future careers in clean energy. The researchers build a model for hydrogen generation potential from iron-rich rocks by identifying hydrogen-producing reactions, testing their geographic extent, and building a scalable workflow for hydrogen resource exploration. To expand clean energy education experiences and contribute to workforce development, the researchers will create introductory experiential learning opportunities focused on the role of Earth science in clean energy futures and will expand upper level undergraduate research opportunities through course-based research relating to hydrogen as a future energy source. Additionally, team will facilitate discussions between academia and industry through a clean energy symposium, and will connect students to employers for on-the-job training in sustainable geoscience research, thereby providing students with training for future clean energy careers.<br/><br/>The project identifies and characterizes new natural hydrogen resources in the United States and gauges the natural hydrogen production potential of iron-rich rocks. This is the first-time natural hydrogen generation through low temperature oxidation reactions is practically tested in iron-rich geologic units in the United States. Quantification of hydrogen-producing reactions in iron-rich rocks in drill cores from across the mid-continent of the United States requires application of a multi-method, multi-scale workflow. The researchers quantify hydrogen generation potential of iron-rich rocks by calculating the total reduced iron remaining in the rock unit that has the capacity to react with subsurface fluids which requires (1) determination of mineral oxidation reactions, mineral volumes, and iron valency; (2) measurement of oxidation-reduction potential of regional subsurface fluids in direct contact with iron-rich rocks, (3) direct measurement of hydrogen gas in boreholes that intersect iron-rich rocks; and (4) identification of microbial hydrogen consumption. Subsequent tasks involve mapping of gas and fluid migration paths to quantify regional hydrogen transport and storage and determining regional trap and seal potential through application of geospatial and geophysical data analysis.

Second, an exploration of image potential-enhanced coagulation sink rates. Finally, an evaluation of the impact of chemical composition on coagulation sink rates. Research tasks in this project include: (1) the first experimental validation of coagulation rate models that incorporate Van der Walls potentials for sub-10 nanometer and 50-100 nanometer cloud condensation nuclei; (2) an innovative investigation of image potential effects on coagulation rates; (3) an update to our understanding of coagulation sink rates for chemically heterogenous particle coagulation; and (4) an improved coagulation model. Results from this proposed work will be incorporated into curricula which includes hands-on laboratory experience for both undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, a curriculum for summer camp programs reaching K-12 students will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PCMI is an outreach program of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, and has been held annually since 1991. Each year the program centers around a research theme in the mathematical sciences, chosen to reflect the most active areas in mathematics where new advances are most likely to be stimulated by the type of interaction that PCMI facilitates. The constituent subprograms include: the core Graduate Summer School, a set of 8 minicourses aimed at graduate students, both more advanced and those just starting out; an accompanying Research Program, which is an opportunity for researchers at all levels, ranging from postdocs to the most distinguished leaders in the field, to interact and collaborate; an Undergraduate Summer School, which includes both a lecture course and a small group research experience; the Undergraduate Faculty Program, which brings together a small group of faculty from undergraduate-facing institutions who wish to reengage with the research activities in their field; finally, a small workshop centered on a variety of topics related to Diversity and Inclusion in the mathematics classroom and the general mathematics community.  Each group is occupied during the three weeks of the program with their specific activities. PCMI provides a space where interaction between these different groups can happen easily and naturally. These interactions lead to new research collaborations, new mentoring opportunities, and the possibility for the younger participants to learn more about becoming part of the mathematical community.  A central goal of PCMI is to bring together a group of students and more senior mathematicians, diverse in as many dimensions as possible, to engage in high level mathematical interactions, with an underlying emphasis on pedagogical excellence and the importance of the interrelationship of the members of this broad mathematical community.<br/> <br/>The mathematical focus in a PCMI summer session is concentrated on areas of recognized importance with a high level of activity.  Programs are typically selected about eighteen months in advance, with a specially designated group of organizers, themselves leading specialists in the field, to guide the intellectual coherence of the session. Upcoming programs are: Motivic Homotopy Theory (2024) and Extremal and Probabilistic Combinatorics (2025).  Some of the recent programs include: Quantum Computation (2023), Number Theory Informed by Computation (2022), Quantum Field Theory and Manifold Invariants (2019) and Random Matrix Theory (2018).  Attendees have included a number of recent Fields Medalists and other of the most distinguished researchers.  The outcomes of each of these sessions includes a volume of lecture notes, published by the AMS, and a professionally produced video archive of the graduate mini-course lectures.  The long history of the program, and the variety of fields which it has covered, means that very many mathematicians in the US and abroad have attended PCMI as students or researchers at some point in their careers, and many report that the experience was pivotal in the development of their research program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classical setting of this problem pertains to particle systems which collide according to the laws of classical mechanics. The same problem emerges in more modern theories of statistical physics, where particles are replaced by waves that interact according to some Hamiltonian wave-type partial differential equation. Such theories of statistical physics for waves often go by the name of ?wave turbulence theory?, because they play a central role in understanding turbulent behaviors in wave systems. This has applications in many areas of science such as quantum mechanics, oceanography, climate science, etc. Broadly speaking, the goal of this project is to advance the mathematical, and hence scientific, understanding of such turbulence theories, and settle some longstanding conjectures in mathematical physics on the foundations of statistical mechanics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Even in its classical setting, Hilbert?s sixth problem remains a formidable task, that has only been resolved for short times. The project seeks to provide its long-time resolution, thus giving a final answer to this longstanding open problem. This amounts to giving the rigorous derivation of Boltzmann?s kinetic equation starting from Newton?s laws, followed by the derivation of the macroscopic fluid models (Euler?s and Navier-Stokes equations). In parallel, the project proposes similar justifications in the setting of wave turbulence theory. There too, the Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to provide the long-time derivation of the corresponding ?wave kinetic equations? for various wave systems of scientific interest. Starting with the nonlinear Schrdinger equation as a prime model for nonlinear wave systems, this will be followed by similar investigations for other wave systems, like many-particle quantum systems and some models coming from ocean and climate science. Finally, the project will investigate mathematical problems related to the turbulence aspects of wave turbulence theory. There, the PI intends to use the above rigorous derivation of the wave kinetic equations, combined with an analysis of solutions to those equations, to understand turbulence phenomena for wave systems, such as energy cascades and growth of Sobolev norms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One key challenge is the lower heat conduction capability of various nanostructures in these devices. Heat conduction in solids is mainly through transport of electrons and atomic vibrations (phonons). As the characteristic size of structures reduces to the nanoscale, scattering of electrons and phonons at thermal boundaries can significantly suppress the thermal conductivity. One promising strategy to address this issue is to construct new heat dissipation channels from the coupling between infrared light and optically active phonons, which has recently been shown to serve as effective energy carriers to enhance the thermal conductivity of polar nanostructures. This novel observation motivates this project to pursue the maximum possible heat conduction capability via these novel energy carriers in solids, which will be realized through systematic measurements to understand and tune the factors that control their excitation and propagation along polar nanowires, nanoribbons, and thin films, which are widely used in various engineering devices. As such, the obtained knowledge will contribute to novel solutions of electronic device cooling. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds, stimulate scientific curiosities from K-12 students, and contribute towards cultivating the future workforce for the U.S. high-tech industry.<br/> <br/>The primary technical objective of this project is to understand the excitation and propagation mechanisms of coupled infrared light and optically active phonons, which are called surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs), and to maximize the SPhP-mediated heat conduction. Systematic experiments will be conducted to answer key scientific questions including: (1) What is the upper limit for SPhP-mediated thermal conductivity? (2) How can SPhPs be optimized to maximize their thermal transport capabilities? and (3) What are the roles of various confinement effects on SPhP-mediated thermal transport? Through carefully designed experiments targeted for addressing these questions, the project will generate new fundamental knowledge about SPhP-mediated heat conduction. Importantly, the new understanding will enable rational engineering design to achieve a SPhP-mediated thermal conductivity of potentially >100 W/mK, which could effectively offset the classical size effect that significantly suppresses the thermal conductivity of nanostructures. Importantly, substantial SPhP contribution to conduction occurs under a non-equilibrium condition with SPhP number densities well beyond the corresponding equilibrium values, which is in a regime remarkably different from the classical near-equilibrium approximation. As such, this project could both shift the conventional paradigm of near-equilibrium heat conduction and produce transformative engineering impacts through providing an effective SPhP-based heat dissipation channel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This versatile language is used throughout algebra and has fueled multiple recent advances, not only in algebraic geometry itself but also in representation theory, number theory, symplectic geometry and other fields. Algebraic varieties are typically endowed with additional structures, such as vector bundles. Local sections of vector bundles are mathematical abstractions of fields in physics, making algebraic geometry indispensable for the study of physical phenomena like mirror symmetry and other dualities. A recurring theme in moduli theory is the interplay between moduli spaces of vector bundles, which parametrize them geometrically and can be studied analytically, and the derived categories of algebraic varieties, which encode algebraic and homological properties of vector bundles. Derived categories provide a bridge from algebraic geometry to the emerging field of non-commutative geometry. Indeed, functors and equivalences between derived categories are deeply related to the birational (local) geometry of algebraic varieties. This project will further the study of derived categories. The PI will deliver graduate-level mini-courses and lectures at conferences, professional development events, and summer schools for graduate students. Many sub-projects are suitable as thesis topics for graduate students. Furthermore, several problems are designed specifically for undergraduate participants in the research and training program in algebraic geometry organized by the PI.<br/><br/>In more detail, the proposed reserch is centered around two main themes. The first is the study of derived categories of moduli spaces and Fano varieties more broadly. The derived categories of Fano varieties, unlike Calabi-Yau or most canonically polarized varieties, admit semi-orthogonal decompositions; from the perspective of non-commutative geometry, Fano varieties are built from more elementary blocks. A beautiful picture emerges, where the decompositions of various Fano varieties, related by birational transformations, undergo rearrangements, which we call weaving patterns. Their construction is motivated by ideas of mirror symmetry, quantum cohomology, vanishing theorems of the minimal model program, and quantization. The PI will advance this program for a wide variety of spaces: moduli spaces of vector bundles, parabolic bundles and Higgs bundles on curves, toric varieties, flag varieties, moduli of sheaves with one-dimensional support on K3 surfaces, and fixed-point loci of anti-symplectic involutions on projective hyperkahler varieties. The second theme is to continue the study of the categorical Milnor fiber for deformations of singular algebraic varieties, describe its mirror symmetry interpretation, and find applications to moduli of algebraic surfaces of geometric genus zero, including Dolgachev surfaces and fake del Pezzo surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But the consequences of greenhouse warming that matter for people are regional rather than global and involve other factors besides temperature.  One such factor is warming-induced change in atmospheric circulation, which can, for example, cause some regions to dry out while others become more flood prone. The importance of circulation change for regional climate challenges efforts to address climate impacts since the dynamical mechanisms through which warming induces circulation change are not well understood, and model simulations used to inform decision making do not show strong agreement as to how much circulation change will occur.  A further consideration is that the amount of circulation change is not necessarily proportional to the amount of global temperature increase.  Previous work by the Principal Investigators (PIs) of this project found several examples of nonlinear behavior, for instance the strength of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley Cell (the overturning cell with rising motion near the equator and subsidence over the Northern subtropics) decreases for a doubling of CO2 but increases if CO2 is further increased to a tripling.<br/><br/>Work under this award seeks to understand the circulation response to CO2 increase, focusing specifically on the reasons for differences in circulation change from one climate model to another and the mechanisms responsible for nonlinearity in circulation change.  One mechanism for nonlinearity is the rapid weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which occurs at a particular level of CO2 increase and causes circulation change by creating a patch of colder sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic.  The rapid weakening of the AMOC happens at different CO2 levels in different climate models and is thus a source of inter-model spread in circulation change.  Another mechanism is CO2-induced change in stratospheric ozone, as CO2 increase affects the amount and latitudinal distribution of stratospheric ozone, which in turn can influence the jet stream because ozone causes radiative heating which produces upper-level temperature contrasts.  The CO2-ozone feedback, in which CO2 influences temperature which in turn affects ozone causing further temperature change, has only recently been recognized as a contributing factor to climate and circulation change.  The research is conducted through analysis of model simulations available through several Model Intercomparison Projects, along with new simulations generated using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the climate model of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS Model E2.2).<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the influence of circulation change on regional climate change, as noted above.  A related consideration is that assessments of regional climate change often assume that regional climate changes will be proportional to global temperature increase, thus research on the nonlinearity of circulation change has direct bearing on regional climate change assessments.  The PIs are well positioned to disseminate their results to the climate impacts community as both have been authors on previous assessments including reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organization.  In addition, the PIs participate in outreach programs within their communities including the Baltimore Ingenuity Project (IP), and the work provides support and training to two graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major theme of modern number theory is to use Galois actions to gain new insight into questions about integer or rational solutions to polynomial equations that have stimulated mathematical activity since ancient times. One major way that Galois actions are applied toward these questions is to interpolate them into continuously varying families. To make an analogy, interpolation through the Galois actions can be thought of as threading a string through a set of beads. This project concerns ""degeneracies"" or ""singularities"" within these families, analogous to a knot lying at a point of convergence among strands of the string. This project aims to not only ""untie"" such degeneracies to access the information they seem to obscure, but also to reveal the additional number-theoretic information in the degeneracy itself. Funding for this project will also be dedicated to supporting mathematical activity in Western Pennsylvania, such as bringing external speakers to Pittsburgh Number Theory Days and encouraging student activity in research and outreach. As far as student research, the PI will advise graduate and undergraduate student researchers working toward the targeted research outcomes of this project. And as far as outreach, the PI will recruit and support undergraduate students working in grant-funded outreach efforts to enrich math education for elementary and middle school students. <br/><br/>Developments in the p-adic variation of Galois representations and of modular forms has fueled great progress in modern algebraic number theory. But when degeneracies occur in interpolation, notions and tools are lacking or need refinement. This project aims to resolve and apply these degeneracies in various settings using homological tools. Among the targeted outcomes are refinements of links between Galois representations and modular forms, applications of new notions of p-adically interpolated modular forms to conjectures about derived enrichments of the Langlands correspondence, and new techniques to compute rational or integral solutions to polynomial equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will investigate the impact of engaging teacher candidates and new teachers in video-based analysis of STEM classrooms with the goal of building skills in noticing inclusive approaches to STEM teaching. The project aims to engage ~200 future and current STEM teachers in video-based analysis through teacher preparation programs at seven institutions geographically spread across the country. The research is designed to investigate the impact of this video-based approach on STEM teacher effectiveness and retention in high-need schools. The project has the potential to produce new insights about this model of using video-based analysis for preparing and retaining effective STEM teachers in high-need schools with skills in inclusive STEM teaching.<br/><br/>This project at Vanderbilt University, Texas State University San Marcos, Teachers College Columbia University, West Chester University, University of Northern Iowa, Louisiana State University, and Kennesaw State University includes partnerships with high-need school districts local to each of our seven research sites. The project aims to address the following research questions: 1) How does K-12 teachers? professional vision for equitable science teaching change over time through video-based examinations of practice from teacher education through induction? and, 2) How does teachers? development of professional vision for equitable science teaching through video-based examinations of practice relate to their effectiveness and retention in high-need schools? Using a design-based research approach, two cohorts of prospective science teachers will engage in learning opportunities that support professional vision for equitable science teaching through video-based examinations of practice as part of their science methods coursework and field experiences. Selected teachers will then be followed into their induction year(s) at high-need school districts and continue to be provided support through networked video clubs. Direct observations of STEM teaching, as well as survey measures of teacher self-efficacy and equitable teaching practices, will be used to assess STEM teacher effectiveness. Surveys of teacher intentions to remain in the profession and social network analysis will be used to evaluate potential impacts on STEM teacher retention. Additionally, the project aspires to develop cross-site, longitudinal case studies across the seven sites and multiple geographic regions based on recordings of video analysis discussions, teacher interviews, and written artifacts from teacher preparation activities. The project has the promise of developing and evaluating a model for cultivating equitable noticing skills among STEM teacher candidates that could adapted by other STEM teacher preparation and professional development programs. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Machan of the University of Virginia is studying the catalytic reduction of dioxygen by molecular manganese compounds. The reduction of dioxygen can be used for energy production from chemical bonds in devices such as fuel cells, where it is the preferred reaction to pair with the oxidation of chemical fuels to produce power. In order to make these systems deployable and scalable, it is essential to develop catalysts made from earth abundant materials. Although Mn is known to have strong interactions with dioxygen, catalysts made from this metal are relatively rare because effective strategies to accelerate catalysis based on Mn are underdeveloped. These studies on dioxygen reduction are aimed at developing design principles for better manganese catalysts, to achieve sufficient performance metrics to compete with other transition metals. An important part of these efforts is a research-focused educational outreach program to provide students with training in science communication.  Kits will also be developed to provide research-based lab experience for undergraduates at all levels. The research goals under study and the educational components under development are addressing important priorities for society by meeting the growing needs for new energy technologies and familiarizing students with energy research at early career stages.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Machan research team at the University of Virginia is studying the catalytic reduction of dioxygen by molecular manganese compounds.  As an earth abundant transition metal that binds strongly to dioxygen, manganese has great potential to be an effective catalyst for dioxygen reduction. However, to achieve sufficient reaction rates, there is a need to develop strategies for destabilizing the intermediate species. This is an ongoing challenge, since far less is known about the use of manganese as a catalyst for dioxygen reduction than is known for approaches employing other transition metals. These research efforts will address this need by investigating how the primary environment of the manganese active site regulates dioxygen binding, how the transfer of substrate to the active site can be controlled to select for specific reduction products, and how the use of secondary metal ions can disrupt stable manganese dioxygen adducts to accelerate the observed reactions. Overall, these studies on manganese-based dioxygen reduction are evaluating the structure-function parameters that regulate the reaction pathways for the two possible reaction products: hydrogen peroxide and water. By improving the activity of manganese-based electrocatalysts through this iterative design strategy, these studies are addressing the ongoing need for the fundamental understanding of dioxygen reduction, which is required for better renewable energy utilization in the long term.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the project is grounded in power distribution systems, whose modular structure and hierarchical positioning of subsystems in subnetworks make them ideal candidates for compositional learning and control design, in which dynamical properties and performance guarantees propagate among hierarchical subsystems. To this end, both theory and algorithms will exploit physical invariants and compositional network structure to improve the generalization of learned components beyond their training regime, mitigate the prohibitive data requirements of current approaches, and provide auditable assurances of both component-level and system-level performance.<br/><br/>This project will be comprised of three closely related thrusts. The first thrust will build upon the formalism of port-Hamiltonian systems and design data-driven algorithms which learn dynamical models of individual subsystems that embed network structure, and control policies that leverage these structures to provide local performance guarantees.  The second thrust will characterize latent uncertainty by reformulating port-Hamiltonian models in the context of neural stochastic differential equations. Explicitly modeling process noise in this way will facilitate the data-driven design of control policies which reason directly about the risk of constraint violation at both the subsystem and, ultimately, network level. Thus equipped, the third thrust will develop theoretical mechanisms for propagating subsystem-level input-output properties to network-level guarantees, without further data collection or learning. These results will guide the development of algorithms to identify which subsystems influence network-level guarantees most directly, and thereby prioritize further data collection and learning for the most critical subsystems. All algorithms will be implemented and validated in a physical hardware testbed which faithfully emulates a large power distribution network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, it is often advantageous to have a fleet of lower-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) searching an area than a single, highly capable platform (airship). The nodes in these sophisticated networks, however, are tempting targets for bad actors. Although recognized as a vulnerability for multi-agent systems, current fault-detection methods have significant limitations. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award supports research that examines the issue of faulted-agent identification through the lens of Biologically Inspired Design. The objective of this proposal is to design and evaluate a new biologically inspired approach based on ant colonies to identify faulted agents within a swarm, thus increasing resilience. Despite a lack of central control and low individual processing power, ant colonies have sophisticated approaches to identify intruders. The application of this biologically-inspired response to colony intruders will enhance the ability of swarms to identify faulted agents over current approaches. This approach is decentralized, scalable, only requires each agent to have local knowledge, and can be implemented without onboard machine learning. The research serves the interests of the United States in its potential to establish and demonstrate a framework to identify faulted agents without requiring centralized control; it is also scalable and does not require sophisticated agents such as on-board machine learning. These developments have the potential to provide a solution-neutral framework applicable to a variety of vulnerable systems. Increased resilience protects citizens, improves services, and reduces damage after faults; the approach investigated in this work may also help to protect combat drone swarms from infiltration, thereby enhancing our national defense. Finally, outreach activities will involve the local student veteran population, exposing this group to Systems Engineering research and enhancing the future STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to design and validate a faulted agent detection algorithm inspired by the use of Cuticular Hydrocarbon Profiles to identify intruders in ant colonies. The first of three initiatives to achieve this goal is to create a mathematical model of the Cuticular Hydrocarbon Faulted Agent Detection Algorithm (CHC FADA). A solution-neutral faulted agent identification approach will be explored through analysis and modeling of Cuticular Hydrocarbon (CHC) spread in ant colonies. Secondly, the effectiveness of the CHC FADA will be analyzed through a series of simulation-based tests that will examine both equipment failures and Byzantine faults. Third, CHC FAFA will be validated by performing real-world tests with a robotic swarm. Validation includes a student-focused cybersecurity challenge that targets high performing cybersecurity students, as well as veteran students. The outcome of this work is threefold. First, it will document a solution-neutral formulation of a eusocial insect-inspired fault detection approach. The significance of this outcome is a new approach that is decentralized, scalable, only requires each agent to have local knowledge, and can be implemented without onboard machine learning. Secondly, the work will provide measurement of the effectiveness of the new approach. A series of validation tests will be performed with both simulations and our physical test platform. Finally, this work seeks to accomplish initial integration of the local veteran population into Systems Engineering research through the real-world validation testing.

In California, there are over 6,000 different plant species, and about a third of them are rare. Often found in only a single county or a few adjacent counties, rare species are those that live in small areas. Because rare species occupy small areas, any changes to their environment can affect them more relative to widespread species. By studying their genetic makeup and aspects of their morphology and ecology, this study aims to increase our knowledge about rare plants. Understanding how rare plants evolve and how genetically diverse they are will help biologists to manage and protect these rare species. This study focuses on four rare plants in northwestern California. This area is known for its unique plants but faces important challenges from recent wildfires and prolonged droughts. This project will also provide research experience for college and graduate students in northern California, including for students who are underrepresented in the sciences. The results of the study will be presented to local indigenous tribes and to regional and national societies.<br/><br/>Hotspots of biodiversity have a high proportion of rare plants: it is estimated that about a third of plant taxa in the California Floristic Province are rare. Recent evidence has shown that budding speciation could be a primary driver of rare species diversity in the California Floristic Province. Despite the apparent relative importance of rare species in the assemblage of biodiversity hotspots, fine evolutionary scale studies that test the predictions of budding speciation are missing, and little is known about the origin and genetics of rare plant species. Budding speciation is defined as a process in which a widespread species (progenitor) gives rise to a narrowly distributed species (derivative), with the ?derivative? species being geographically adjacent or overlapping to the ?progenitor? species. This project will study four rare species (Erysimum menziesii, Lupinus constancei, Silene serpentinicola, Wyethia longicaulis) in northwestern California to: 1) test the phylogenetic and genetic predictions of budding speciation, and 2) test for ecological divergence between the ?derivative? and its putative ?progenitor.? The project will sample hundreds or thousands of DNA regions and multiple individuals per species for aim 1. Vegetative habit, flower size, flowering period, soil preference, and climatic niche will be compared between the ?derivative? species and its putative ?progenitor? for aim 2.

Many of the chemical compounds that are used in medicine, agriculture, and polymer chemistry have complex structures that require lengthy synthetic processes. Catalyst development is playing a critical role in improving the efficiency and sustainability of these processes by cutting the number of synthetic transformations required, by allowing more readily abundant starting materials to be used, and by minimizing the production of waste byproducts. Many of the catalysts currently used in the chemical industry contain only one metal in their active site. In contrast, many enzymes that carry out challenging reactions contain clusters of multiple metals in their active sites. Taking inspiration from biology, Dr. Uyeda?s research group is designing ligands that support the presence of multiple metals in their active site and is using them to carry out a number of organic transformations. Because a diverse group of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers participate in this project, this work is also helping to train and develop the next generation scientific workforce. In addition to this, outreach activities are planned that will enable students to learn how commercial products are generated from sustainable resources, such as soybeans.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to investigate multi-metallic active sites as a strategy to improve the activity and selectivity of homogeneous transition metal catalysts. The approach involves designing new classes of ligands that can bind multiple metals simultaneously while also possessing sufficient electronic flexibility to enable two-electron redox processes, such as oxidative addition, reductive elimination, and oxidative coupling. These catalysts will be investigated for (i) coupling and cycloaddition reactions of alkenes and 1,3-dienes, (ii) carbonylation reactions using well-defined heterometallic carbonyl clusters, and (iii) asymmetric reactions using chiral ligands. The primary intellectual merit of this project lies in its ability to systematically tune the composition of multi-metallic active sites to gain mechanistic insight into metal?metal cooperativity effects. While doing this, the Used team will also work to develop sustainable reactions by using earth abundant metals, such as nickel, cobalt, and iron. In addition to this, and important from a sustainable chemistry point of view, the reactions chosen for development here, cycloaddition and coupling reactions of feedstock olefins and small molecules, are by design atom-economical and are expected to produce minimal byproducts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Arctic polar vortex is highly variable; sometimes it is weak and distorted while other times it is strong. Vortex strength is known to impact weather in the troposphere and variability in the mesosphere, thermosphere, and ionosphere. The state of the polar vortex is predictable up to two weeks in advance, so knowledge of the vortex state may increase predictability in other regions of the atmosphere, including the ionosphere.  The ionosphere is critical for both communication and navigational signals; when the ionosphere is disturbed these signals are disrupted.  In this work, the investigators will use the state of the polar vortex to explain thermospheric neutral winds, composition, and the state of the ionosphere at northern midlatitudes. Training of a high-school student at University of Colorado, Boulder and several undergraduates through Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program at MIT, Haystack Observatory is envisioned.<br/><br/>It is known that polar vortex impacts on the thermosphere and ionosphere are modulated by vortex strength. At one extreme, the polar vortex is weak and is associated with Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs). Extensive observational and modeling studies of weak vortex states have elucidated the changes in thermospheric temperature, wind, wave amplitudes, composition, and ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC), along with the mechanisms driving these changes. In contrast, relatively little is known about thermospheric and ionospheric impacts during strong polar vortices. The work seeks to address the impacts of strong polar vortex on ionospheric electron densities, thermospheric composition, and winds. The team will also explore if ionospheric electron density changes are driven primarily by composition, neutral winds, or electric fields during such events. This study will use superposed epoch analysis, empirical models, and case studies of moderate and strong vortex states, leveraging observations of winds from Fabry Perot interferometers, ionospheric parameters from GNSS TEC, incoherent scatter radars, and ionosondes, and satellite observations of thermospheric composition. Whole atmosphere modeling results will be compared to the observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymers are ubiquitous, from the polypeptides in our muscles to the polyolefins of our packages. It is vital that we understand how the structures of these chemicals at the molecular scale impact their properties at the macroscale. Depending on how conditions such as temperature, catalyst requirements, and polymer composition impact depolymerization, this work may have implications in fields ranging from targeted drug delivery to biodegradable agricultural films. Furthermore, the depolymerization products have the potential for use as monomers in a circular polymer economy when paired with existing catalytic systems.  Undergraduate researchers will gain critical preparation as early career scientists while pursuing these goals in a closely mentored environment and will participate in ongoing quarterly meetings with graduate research groups. This research project will provide an exceptional training opportunity for an early career scientist who desires greater research experience prior to pursuing a doctorate degree. Mentorship of this post-baccalaureate trainee will focus on the skills critical to success in graduate school ? experimental design, data analysis, project management, near-peer mentoring, presentation, and writing.<br/><br/>There are inherent challenges in synthesizing cyclic polymer topologies and so they remain relatively uncommon. The Getzler group designed a catalyst to help construct cyclic polyesters, a shape that is otherwise difficult to access. Due to the lack of chain ends, these macrocycles are protected from a common, uncontrolled, degradation pathway. By carefully modifying the monomers used to form the macrocycles, other unique degradation pathways may be enabled and controlled. In this research project, the Getzler group will synthesize and characterize a range of cyclic homopolymers and copolymers with different side-chain structures.  The impact of topology and side chains on the polymer stability and depolymerization mechanism will be examined. An important goal of this research is to understand the factors that control depolymerization of cyclic polyesters.  If successful, the fundamental knowledge gleaned from these studies will inform the rational design of materials with customizable degradation profiles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Limited research administration and support can hamper competition for research funding. By enhancing the services provided at ERIs, the nation's research enterprise benefits by utilizing these talented investigators to help make impactful scientific advances. Bradley University's PEER project will serve as a model for strategies that peer institutions can implement to support their faculty and enhance their research infrastructure in sustainable ways. As a result of this five-year project, Bradley University will see measurable increases in the number and quality of proposals submitted by university employees, the number of publications generated by research-active faculty, and the number of students involved in collaborative research. Research and evaluation efforts will generate new knowledge on best practices and sustainable models of research and sponsored program administration at smaller institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and ERIs. This project will open research opportunities and grant-seeking to faculty that otherwise would not have been able to pursue those activities and, in turn, will increase student engagement in mentored research. This high-impact practice will increase student success and earning potential after graduation. Results from the research studies and evaluation efforts will be distributed to audiences of peer institutions through formats such as presentations at national conferences, submissions to peer-reviewed journals on research administration, and distribution through relevant listservs and peer groups. <br/><br/>The overarching goals of the PEER project are to enhance Bradley University's research enterprise in innovative and sustainable ways, to serve as a model for peer institutions, and to contribute to the knowledge base on research administration at ERIs. The project team will accomplish three key objectives: (1) Enhance the function of the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) through tailored investments in human capital and training, (2) stimulate a campus culture that encourages and celebrates research and grant seeking, and (3) research, evaluate, and disseminate results on program effectiveness. The PEER project will generate new knowledge on the efficacy of research administration interventions at PUI/ERIs through research and program evaluation. Mixed-methods research will be conducted on the value of two innovative interventions ? the OSP Advocate program and the multi-institution peer review program. The OSP Advocate program will consist of five advocates, one each from Bradley's five colleges, who will serve as a network of individuals with training and familiarity in both pre- and post-award practices and will support research and grant-seeking efforts across the institution. The multi-institution peer review program will begin with a partnership with Western Illinois University and add others after completing the pilot study. For this initiative, faculty from one institution will review proposals written by faculty in a related field at the other institution. Neither of these innovative interventions has been discussed in the literature in the manner they will be implemented in the PEER project.

First, industry and university feedback reveal that K12 assessments do not measure all the things engineers do beyond math and science ability. Second, although the public, educators, and researchers perceive there is an achievement gap, current STEM assessments often have racial biases, creating a gatekeeping effect. These two realities combined keep many minoritized youth from becoming engineers. This CAREER project addresses the assessment gap by partnering with teenagers to create innovative, equitable assessments and technology that supports peer assessment. The study will provide information about how middle and high school students understand and identify engineering, show educators and researchers gaps between their interpretations and student interpretations of engineering, and help educators and researchers understand how to create a healthy culture of peer assessment. Overall, this CAREER project will provide tools for assessment in K12 engineering education that have the potential to create opportunities rather than restrict opportunities for minoritized youth to have future careers in engineering. <br/><br/>This five-year CAREER project will use a mixed methods, iterative distributed participatory design approach to investigate the following research questions: How do K12 learners co-create an equitable engineering epistemic frame that aligns with engineering professional activities? How does using peer assessment software affect learners? engineering education experiences in informal robotics clubs in Black churches? The project intentionally engages the most marginalized students first in assessment development, responding to traditional bias in STEM assessment and learning from students how they assess. This project also increases minoritized groups? participation in STEM and public engagement with science and technology through hosting FIRST robotics clubs in Black churches. The project employs and integrates innovative approaches to achieve its outcomes. Using epistemic frames as a foundation and the noticing framework (with students as lead) over three phases (Phase I-III), teenagers and minoritized communities act as user, tester, informant, and design partner to co-create: 1) an engineering epistemic frame and 2) a web-based, mobile-enabled peer assessment software. These outcomes will be achieved through Design Workshops, prototyping, and user studies during Phases I and II (Year 1 & 2, n=15). After the epistemic frame and software are developed, two robotics teams will pilot both to peer assess each other during two robotics seasons, offering feedback for refinement during Phase III (Year 3 & 4, n=30). Data analysis informs each iteration of epistemic frame and software during Phases I-III. Content analysis will be applied to data sources which include in situ videos, digital artifacts, interviews, and focus groups. In Phase IV (Year 5), researchers will analyze the peer assessment data using Epistemic Network Analysis. The integrated education plan involves training of rookie robotics coaches, developing STEM students into engineering education researchers, generating artifacts for professional development of teachers. Results will be disseminated through a Lessons Learned series which includes deployment of software, workshops for educators and researchers, a video archive for professional development, and a playbook for partnering with nontraditional sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the basic science leading to these events and the relationship to other types of slip along these faults is still not well understood. One of these different types of slip is called slow earthquakes (or slow slip events). Slow slip occurs along the subduction fault at depths of 25-65 km, below where most major earthquakes nucleate. These events have likely triggered these catastrophic megathrust earthquakes in the past. Thus, understanding what causes and controls slow earthquake formation is vital to understand the seismic cycle of subduction zone faults. How and why these slow earthquakes form remains debated; geophysical and geological observations suggest that high pore fluid pressures likely critically stress these faults and may trigger slow earthquakes. Yet, we do not know where the fluids that create these fluid pressure conditions come from. Making it impossible to understand the relationship between these fluids and slow earthquakes. Previous modeling work showed chemical reactions in the subducting plate, called dehydration reactions, may release the needed water. Yet, these models have not been ground-truthed in the geologic (rock) record. This proposal seeks out geologic evidence of the fluids that may lead to slow earthquakes and influence earthquake occurrence in subduction zones. The Education Plan increases subduction zone hazard literacy in the Pacific Northwest. It does this through curriculum development for the Rockin? Out program at the University of Washington. It will also host the RESESS Satellite program at the University of Washington for three summers. This will provide ~18 geoscientist undergraduates with intensive summer research projects in subduction zone science. Together, the science and education plans will increase knowledge of subduction zone earthquakes and raise awareness of subduction zone hazards in the general public.<br/><br/>The goals of this proposal are to look for geologic evidence of dehydration reactions within previously subducted rocks and see if there is a link between fluid production and the occurrence of deep slow earthquakes. One of the main hypotheses for slow earthquakes in subduction zones is that they are produced by high pore fluid pressures (Pf) along the megathrust which lowers the effective normal stress, triggering slow frictional deformation below the base of the subduction seismogenic zone. For this hypothesis to be valid and to explain the observations of slow earthquakes in these regions, fluid sources are required to provide the elevated pore fluid pressures. Petrologic modeling work, currently unconfirmed in the geologic record, shows that fluids liberated during prograde metamorphic dehydration reactions may produce these high Pf, particularly through the breakdown of the minerals lawsonite and chlorite to form epidote within subducting oceanic crust. The project will investigate three exhumed fossil subduction terranes for evidence of these modelled metamorphic reactions. It will use (1) detailed field characterization and petrology to document which of the modeled reactions occur naturally and the volumes of associated fluid production, (2) isotope geochemistry to fingerprint fluid sources and activities, and (3) develop diffusion chronometry tools to test if these metamorphic reactions play a causal role in triggering slow earthquakes. The Education Plan will create new outreach materials through the Rockin? Out program at the University of Washington which visits K-12 classrooms around the state. This will increase subduction zone hazard literacy in the Pacific Northwest, which is one of two active subduction zones within the USA.  It will also provide research experiences for ~18 geoscience undergraduates from a range of backgrounds by hosting the summer RESESS Satellite program for three summers, where each student working on a subduction zone science related project will present their research at national conferences. Overall, the outcomes of this project will increase the collective understanding of the seismic cycle in subduction zones, the role of chemical processes in producing earthquakes, will increase public knowledge of subduction zone science and hazards in WA state, and provide research opportunities for a host of undergraduate students, thus increasing participation in the geosciences and contributing to workforce development.<br/><br/>This award will be funded from the Petrology and Geochemistry (CH), Tectonics (TE) and Education and Human Resources (EHR) programs in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum Impurity Solvers are numerical algorithms that capture the ?entanglement? or ?correlation? of confined quantum systems consisting of a few strongly interacting orbitals coupled to an environment. They are important both in their own right in applications ranging from quantum transport to Kondo physics, and in the context of embedding theories such as the dynamical mean field and self-energy embedding theories. The lack of accurate and generic quantum impurity solvers for impurities with general off-diagonal interactions and impurity-bath hybridization is one of the main theoretical limitations in the accurate simulation of quantum many-body systems. This joint US?Israeli NSF-BSF project will explore novel data-science-inspired tensor contraction and compression schemes for quantum impurity solvers, building on a long-standing collaboration between the US and the Israeli groups, with the aim of providing a new generation of quantum impurity solvers that provide access to areas of parameter space that are currently inaccessible. <br/><br/>Quantum impurity solvers resulting from this international collaboration may enable new techniques for calculating electronic properties of materials, particularly those involving correlated electron motion resulting from strong interactions.

Community partners include the Science Museum of Minnesota, Minnesota High Tech Association, and the Minnesota Education Equity Partnership. Over the five-year period, the alliance will increase STEM B. S. degrees from 700 in 2022 to 1,000 annually by 2028 by providing financial support (stipends) for domestic and international research experiences, internships, supplemental instruction and other student support services and alliances research conferences as evidence-based high impact practices in recruitment and retention.   The social science research project examines the transition of STEM graduates from college, focusing particularly on psychosocial factors during points of transition associated with career pathways. The combination of prospective and retrospective data will be produced about how to help orient students beyond the bachelor?s degree and toward the next steps in their educational and career pathways.  The alliance will broadly disseminate results from project evaluation activities and the NSSA study via conferences such as American Educational Research Association (AERA), International Society for the Learning Sciences among other professional associations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contracts are written in the programming language that developers already use. Thus, developers should be able to use contracts to express with ease expected properties of the inputs and outputs of program components, while the programming language can translate the properties into checks and enforce them as the program runs in real-world conditions.  In other words, contracts promise to act as a programmable monitoring system, up-to-date documentation, a driver for testing, and a source of useful debugging information when the behavior of a component goes awry. Unfortunately, developers --- especially those that use modern, so called higher-order, languages such as Python or JavaScript --- do not buy into the promise of contract systems despite four decades of research.  Contracts simply are second class citizens in current language ecosystems.  The goal of this project is to investigate the design, theory, implementation and practice of a contract-centric programming ecosystem.  The project?s novelty is that the mechanisms that higher-order programming languages use to check contracts can be extended to produce information about how the components of a program work together. As a result, this information can be the basis for (i) tools that help developers visualize, debug, and zoom in on the interactions of components; (ii) a system that assists developers with adding contracts to existing code bases.  The project's results will impact: (i) developers: the ecosystem will directly facilitate key aspects of their day-to-day work; (ii) language designers and implementers: the project will provide tangible guidelines and evidence for how to improve their languages; and (iii) educators: the project will provide means for demonstrating and teaching the value of specifications in software development. <br/><br/>In technical terms, the project's ecosystem will consist of two parts: (i) a contract inference engine for higher-order languages, and (ii) tools for contract-centered debugging, visual inspection, and simplification of code.  Each part will benefit the other. The tools will suggest where to add contracts, and inferred contracts will improve the effectiveness of the tools. The ecosystem's design will yield a novel proxy mechanism for higher-order languages that reflects on the structure and evaluation of a program to expose information about how its components interact. The project?s evaluation of the ecosystem will build on the extensive work of the user community of Racket --- an academic language that is also used in industry --- on collecting benchmark suites with interesting contracts. The investigator and his group will develop a prototype of the ecosystem together with mathematical models that communicate its salient features. The purpose of the prototype is to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the ecosystem. The purpose of the mathematical models is to provide a blueprint for language designers and implementers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changing your major, academic institution, or taking a pause from academic studies is a large decision that many undergraduate students face during their education. Universities provide academic advising and support, however many students make their decisions without accessing these resources or considering all possible options, such as a leave of absence. Once a student leaves engineering, they are unlikely to reconsider that decision, a decision that often has financial implications. In order to better support students who are reconsidering their choice of major, this study will follow undergraduate engineering students to understand how often they reconsider their choice of major and the resources and processes they use while they reconsider their academic path. Survey data will allow us to see patterns in how often students reconsider their choice of major. Interviews will provide student stories, explanations for why they reconsidered their major and what they did while trying to decide their best path forward. Interview and survey data will be used to develop resources to help academic advisors, faculty, and others to recognize when a student might be reconsidering their major and to provide targeted resources and support. Content will also be developed for first-year welcome to college and engineering courses, helping students to realize that reconsidering your major is not uncommon and providing resources to help them make educated decisions. Higher education takes time and money; this project and its outcomes are intended to help students save time and money as well as helping some to stay in engineering by providing support for educated decision-making. This project aligns with the CAREER funding program as the educational components are directly derived from the research. Together they provide the foundation for future research on supporting student decision-making which will lead to faculty development programs and educational materials that can be used by advisors and faculty. This project aligns with the goals of the Division Engineering Education and Centers through its focus on educational research that seeks to promote the creation of 21st century engineers through supporting students when they question their choice of major.<br/>This project will explore undergraduate engineering degree decision-making in order to develop a framework that includes factors and inciting events that lead to academic decision points (ADPs) as well as the resources accessed when students question their chosen engineering degree path. A mixed-methods study (cluster analysis, phenomenology, content analysis with triangulation, and thematic analysis) will use longitudinal text message surveys and open-ended interviews from undergraduate engineering students at a variety of institutions to explore the following questions: RQ1: How often and when do students reach an ADP? RQ2: What factors contribute to or are considered at these ADPs? RQ3: What resources do students use to make their decisions? RQ4: How do students experience ADPs? RQ5: How do students evaluate their options to make a decision? Findings from this project will be presented as quantitative results, composite narratives, and a decision-making framework with resources to recognize and support students facing an academic decision point. These results will be shared through conferences, journal articles, workshops, a book of narratives, and a website housing a variety of resources: the Choose your PATH project. Student-facing resources will include video and written vignettes and statistics normalizing questioning and alternate paths. Student support personnel resources will include a peer mentor training guide, implementation guides including assessments for faculty, recommendations for advising including Starfish flags, and narratives to provide insight for families.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ammonia is a critical component in fertilizers and an ideal zero-carbon energy carrier. If one could achieve the electrochemical production of ammonia using nitrogen gas and water at ambient temperature and limited pressure with a favorable kinetic profile, one would have a more sustainable technology to replace the traditional industrial Haber-Bosch process for ammonia production, which consumes tremendous amounts of fossil fuel and emits massive amounts of carbon dioxide. A reliable understanding of reaction mechanisms is foundational in designing more efficient electrocatalysts. This research aims to develop high-level quantum mechanical simulations beyond the conventional modeling tools to elucidate this important catalytic transformation. This project will integrate multiple educational activities and outreach in a workshop to help K-12 teachers develop curriculum materials on the topics of computation, catalysis, and sustainability, aiming at advancing excitement about science in a more diverse scientific community.<br/><br/>Under this award, Qing Zhao and her research team at Northeastern University will develop a qualitatively and quantitatively reliable quantum mechanical method and an automated embedded correlated wavefunction (AutoECW) theory for kinetic modeling in heterogeneous catalysis.

Using ammonia electrosynthesis as an example, this project seeks tol re-elucidate reaction mechanisms by performing microkinetic modeling of the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) with metal catalysts using the developed AutoECW. Improvements in fundamental understanding have the potential to inspire new design principles and descriptors for ammonia electrosynthesis toward the goal of discovering novel catalysts with improved activity and selectivity.

As an energy carrier that cuts across sectors, natural geologic hydrogen could serve as a future clean energy source. This project focuses on the exploration and characterization of new hydrogen resources in the United States, and innovative education and workforce developments to meet the demand for future careers in clean energy. The researchers build a model for hydrogen generation potential from iron-rich rocks by identifying hydrogen-producing reactions, testing their geographic extent, and building a scalable workflow for hydrogen resource exploration. To expand clean energy education experiences and contribute to workforce development, the researchers will create introductory experiential learning opportunities focused on the role of Earth science in clean energy futures and will expand upper level undergraduate research opportunities through course-based research relating to hydrogen as a future energy source. Additionally, team will facilitate discussions between academia and industry through a clean energy symposium, and will connect students to employers for on-the-job training in sustainable geoscience research, thereby providing students with training for future clean energy careers.<br/><br/>The project identifies and characterizes new natural hydrogen resources in the United States and gauges the natural hydrogen production potential of iron-rich rocks. This is the first-time natural hydrogen generation through low temperature oxidation reactions is practically tested in iron-rich geologic units in the United States. Quantification of hydrogen-producing reactions in iron-rich rocks in drill cores from across the mid-continent of the United States requires application of a multi-method, multi-scale workflow. The researchers quantify hydrogen generation potential of iron-rich rocks by calculating the total reduced iron remaining in the rock unit that has the capacity to react with subsurface fluids which requires (1) determination of mineral oxidation reactions, mineral volumes, and iron valency; (2) measurement of oxidation-reduction potential of regional subsurface fluids in direct contact with iron-rich rocks, (3) direct measurement of hydrogen gas in boreholes that intersect iron-rich rocks; and (4) identification of microbial hydrogen consumption. Subsequent tasks involve mapping of gas and fluid migration paths to quantify regional hydrogen transport and storage and determining regional trap and seal potential through application of geospatial and geophysical data analysis.

The recent discovery of multiple natural diamond inclusions from the deep Earth that contain hydrous phases is compelling evidence that the water cycle of the deep Earth may extend even deeper than was originally believed. This study will use a combination of computational models and experiments to evaluate the stability and geophysical properties of hydrous phases believed to be stable at the conditions of the Earth's lower mantle. Although these are expected to be minor phases, the potential for hydrogen storage in the lower mantle is still considerable, as it comprises approximately 56% of the Earth's volume. This project will fund critical training for an early career scientist who will be guided through learning how to balance teaching, research, and student mentorship at a primarily undergraduate institution. A complementary educational component of this project is to develop a virtual reality application that will help undergraduate geology students develop spatial reasoning skills, with a particular focus on fostering equity and inclusion for neurodiverse students with visual-spatial deficits.<br/><br/>Phase D [MgSi2O4(OH)2] and phase H [MgSiO2(OH)2] are dense hydrous magnesium silicates (DHMSs) that are expected to play a key role in the hydrogen cycle of the lower mantle. Importantly, Fe- and Al-substitution has a profound influence on the stability and properties of these phases. In fact, phase H forms a solid solution with d-AlOOH and e-FeOOH, forming a potentially continuous hydrous reservoir with stability down to the core-mantle boundary. This project combines ab initio calculations with high-pressure, high-temperature vibrational spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction to evaluate the geophysical properties of intermediate compositions of Al,Fe-bearing phase D and phase H, and to probe how cation substitution affects pressure-induced hydrogen bond symmetrization, which can have a substantial influence on the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative. First principle calculations will systematically evaluate how cation substitution influences the pressure-dependent properties and hydrogen accommodation in these phases, providing a theoretical framework for high-pressure experiments. Combining crystallographic and spectroscopic approaches will provide detailed information on the interatomic forces and bonding environments of hydrogen within these phases, helping explain why these phases are stable at extreme pressures and temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also examines the effectiveness and equity of those tactics in various contexts (e.g., labor shortage, infrastructure disruptions, supply-chain disruptions), among others. The project extends microeconomic production theory to dynamic economic resilience and connects these theoretical advances to multi-area data collection efforts.

Specifically, the project aims to develop statistical and machine learning methods that give data scientists the ability to put forward multiple different causal hypotheses, some of which may be incorrect, and automatically distill information from the subset of hypotheses that reflect the true causal relationships between variables while discarding information from all the rest.<br/><br/>Model misspecification poses a fundamental challenge to reliable estimation of causal effects from observational data. In the context of causal inference, model misspecification can be divided into two broad categories: (i) Incorrect specification of a causal model that encodes substantive assumptions used to identify the target parameter, and (ii) Incorrect specification of statistical models, such as outcome regression or propensity score models, used to estimate the identified parameter from finite data. This project aims to build causal inference methods that display both forms of robustness. Concretely, the project aims to build algorithms and tools for data scientists that allow them to (i) Propose multiple causal models and combine effect estimates obtained by applying machine learning models to the identifying functionals of each model such that inferences made based on the aggregated estimate are valid if at least one of the proposed causal models is correct (without requiring any knowledge of which ones may be correct); and (ii) Perform model selection between partially specified candidate causal models such that the model selection procedure is robust to issues of unmeasured confounding and non-ignorable messiness in the data. Building such robust causal inference pipelines and software tools can greatly improve the reliability of decision making processes in a variety of fields even when a controlled experiment cannot be conducted in order to assess causality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photosensitizers are compounds that harness the light energy to facilitate a desirable physical process or chemical transformation. Such molecules have utility in fields spanning solar energy conversion to chemical catalysis, and also photomedicine. This project focuses on a photosensitizer class that shows promise for cancer therapy and may follow a unique type of multimodal action that combines photocatalysis and intermolecular photochemical reactions with singlet oxygen sensitization. The project will use the tools of coordination chemistry plus photophysical and electrochemical techniques to explore the roles of isomerism, agglomeration and confinement, and environment on these pathways. The proposed work will train graduate students and undergraduates in highly multidisciplinary research at the nexus of chemistry, biology, physics, and engineering. This multifaceted training in synthesis, inorganic photophysics and spectroscopy, and electrochemistry will help to prepare the future workforce in science and technology. The broader impact objectives are aimed at improving scientific literacy and addressing educational equity in research. The McFarland team is particularly focused on addressing educational equity issues in undergraduate research and improving scientific literacy using bench-to-bedside projects with societal impact through curriculum-based research experiences (CUREs) for undergraduate STEM students. The project aims to equip tomorrow?s leaders with skills in science communication and expose them to entrepreneurship as it relates to bringing scientific discoveries from the laboratory to society.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Sherri McFarland and her team will examine the redox and excited state properties of oligothiophene-containing Ru(II) complexes, compounds that have important applications as photosensitizers in fields ranging from solar energy conversion to photomedicine. Imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline (IP) ligands appended to oligothiophenes (nT) of sufficient chain length n adopt planarized lowest-energy triplet states that are of significant intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) character. Oligothiophenes are redox active, and the neighboring IP group may enable proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) to facilitate catalytic photoredox reactions from the 3ILCT states. These charge-separated excited states may also undergo chemical dimerization and generate singlet oxygen. The project aims to develop a photophysical model for these systems in simple solvents and in complex biological environments. Each system will be studied from the point of view of molecular structure, redox chemistry and photophysics, with longer term implications for phototherapy mechanisms. The UTA team will synthesize and characterize oligothiophene-appended Ru(II) complexes, [Ru(LL)2(IP-nT)]2+, to probe the effects of various factors on the proposed PCET-facilitated pathways: ionization state, excited state conformation, triplet energy and character, and bimolecular processes. Synthetic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical techniques will be used to test the importance of nT-based triplets with CT character and ionizable groups for multimodal action and probe how the excited state dynamics are influenced at biological interfaces based on factors such as ionization, conformation, and isomerism.  This project aims to advance the fields of coordination chemistry, photochemistry and photophysics, and ultimately photomedicine, in the longer term.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In doing so, this NSF IUSE: EDU Engaged Student Learning Level II project aims to address the well-documented disconnect between upper division mathematics courses and the needs of prospective secondary school teachers. This project will include the development of an open-source semester-long curriculum, where modeling applications will include a variety of environmental, ecological, sustainability, and social issues of interest to students and which will be intimately connected to high school mathematics topics. The curriculum will include student tasks as well as teacher resources and strategies for teaching the course. The project will investigate the prospects and possibilities for deep and meaningful connections between secondary school mathematics content and teaching in an Inquiry-Oriented Dynamical Systems and Modeling course specifically for prospective secondary teachers. The project will be supported by a diverse team of researchers at multiple universities and consultants from math education, mathematics, and secondary education. A National Advisory Board of experts will advise the project team on its core work and will assess the success of the project. The project has potential to significantly impact undergraduate mathematics education and to indirectly impact secondary mathematics education through the curriculum and plans to disseminate work with the mathematics community.<br/><br/>The three broad goals of the project are: (1) creation of the open-source curriculum including student tasks and instructor resources, (2) research on the impact of the curriculum related to prospective teachers content knowledge, how they engage in the Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice, and their beliefs about teaching and learning mathematics, and (3) outreach to the mathematics community aimed at supporting others in designing and modifying upper division mathematics courses for prospective secondary teachers. The four project research questions concern prospective teachers': 1) content knowledge, 2) engagement in the Standards for Mathematical Practice, 3) beliefs on teaching and learning mathematics, and 4) engagement in approximations of teaching practice. This work has both practical contributions (creation of a new curriculum) and theoretical contributions from design-based research (producing research knowledge about teachers' knowledge of secondary mathematics, their beliefs about mathematics teaching and learning, and their mathematical and professional practices). The project will include three semester-long classroom design experiment iterations in three different contexts and each will include a three-phase retrospective data analysis. The project will disseminate its results through publications, a website, workshops, conferences, and working groups with an eye on engaging early curriculum adopters to inform the curriculum development. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>Partial funding for the project is from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Boydston of the University of Wisconsin-Madison will mechanistically investigate polymer structural control in metal-free ring opening metathesis polymerization.  Ring opening metathesis polymerization is a type of polymerization that can be used to produce a variety of useful materials, many of which are considered high-performance plastics since they display remarkable toughness and durability.  Such materials are greatly needed in areas such as light-weighting of vehicles to improve energy efficiency, ballistic impact resistant composition, and even 3D printing.  In this research, systematic studies will be performed to gain understanding of how the specific three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in the polymer structure is controlled during polymerization.  Successful advancement of this new polymerization method has the potential to provide useful information for further developments of synthetic organic chemistry, polymer synthesis, and light induced catalysis.  This work will provide training and education to undergraduate and graduate students in synthetic polymer chemistry, and collaborative research activities with other university researchers.  Outreach activities will focus on workshops to middle and high school visitors to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and an Educators Open House to increase interest in science at local high schools.<br/><br/>This research will focus on the mechanistic understanding of polymer microstructural control in photoredox-mediated ring opening metathesis polymerization initiated by vinyl ethers. Careful studies will be conducted to investigate steric and electronic interactions that govern the orientation of neighboring repeat units in the polymer chains. The unique mechanism of vinyl ether activation in this polymerization will be leveraged to investigate new strategies for controlling polymer stereochemistry and chain-end functionalization.  A mechanistic hypothesis based upon ion-pairing interactions will be evaluated, and the results will be used to design synthetic strategies for currently inaccessible stereoblock copolymers as well as generalizable methods for reducing molecular weight dispersity of the polymer products. These studies have the potential to provide opportunities to complement, validate, and challenge existing hypothesis and assumptions in a broad range of research areas.

Despite being intimately involved in the mechanism of reactions for the synthesis of drug molecules, plastics, and other commodity chemicals, alkyne migratory insertion is a an incompletely understood process, especially for first-row transition metal catalysts. The importance of first-row transition metal catalysts has grown rapidly in recent decades. Even though second- and third-row transition metal catalysts are critical to our civilization, they are generally scarce and thus present serious sustainability and cost issues. First-row transition metals hold promise as they are much more earth abundant and thus more sustainable and economical sources of catalysts. For reaction development to continue with first-row transitions metals, the fundamental mechanisms that govern their chemical behavior need to be properly defined. By studying a series of carefully designed Ni- and Co-catalyzed reactions, Dr. Wilger and his team will investigate the principles that control alkyne migratory insertion. The results of these studies have the potential to facilitate the development of first-row transition metal catalysts.<br/><br/>This current project aims to fully define the mechanisms that control alkyne migratory insertion regioselectivity with first-row transition metals. Alkyne migratory insertion is a common elementary process in transition-metal-catalyzed reactions. However, the factors that govern the success and selectivity of these reactions are not well established, especially for first-row transition metals. For example, determining whether a particular alkyne migratory insertion will be kinetically accessible and/or regioselective is generally only possible through direct experimentation. In a recent study, alkyne migratory insertion selectivity in a Ni-catalyzed indenone synthesis was found to depend on both the steric properties of the alkyne and the electronic parameters of the aryl donor, a phenomenon which had not been observed for any previous transition metal-catalyzed reaction. If successful, this project will define the driving force for the observed regioselectivity effects, determine regioselectivity in related chemical transformations, and determine whether these selectivity effects are observed with other first-row transition metals. This information would greatly facilitate our understanding and design of first-row transition metal-catalyzed reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adoption of genome sequencing in clinical practice is critically dependent on our computational ability to analyze large volumes of data ? significantly larger than data processed today in modern data-centers. But unfortunately, due to the impending end of Moore?s law, growth in general-purpose processor performance has stagnated, and therefore commodity systems are unlikely to meet the growing computational needs in genomics. To address this need, this project is developing custom hardware accelerators that are co-designed and integrated with bioinformatics sequencing software to enable pervasive use of genome sequencing. Software and hardware artifacts and benchmarks from this project can directly impact genomics practitioners, as well as spur systems research in this area.  This project also supports a broad range of educational and outreach activities.<br/><br/>The project has three specific aims. One, design domain-specific dynamic programming and in-memory accelerators for whole genome sequencing (WGS). Instead of kernel-specific accelerators, they will support a wide range of genomics kernels, including emerging long-read sequencing and pangenomics. Two, develop point-of-care pathogen detectors using Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) long-read real-time sequencers. The project will develop custom hardware solutions to analyze sequenced raw data (squiggles) in real-time to leverage ONT sequencer?s read-until feature and produce actionable diagnostics results at point-of-care.

In response, nations worldwide are striving to integrate renewable energy sources into the existing power grid to reduce fossil-fuel consumption. As the energy resource diversifies and sensing and control increases, the power grid grows into a smart grid. Compared with the traditional fuel-based power grid that only has uni-source power connections, the multi-source power grid suffers from scalability, stability, and multi-modality issues caused by many heterogeneous power generators.<br/>An accurate, real-time, and scalable anomaly detection and diagnosis method that can protect the system is highly desirable yet extremely challenging.  Due to the reliance on information and communication technologies, the smart grid faces a significant risk in security. For example, the attacker's malicious modification of controllers or sensors in power electronics converters, such as in PV farms and wind farms, would affect both power electronics and the grid, leading to catastrophic failures and substantial economic losses. However, existing anomaly detection methods suffer from inherited limitations in one or more of the following aspects: sensitivity, specificity, scalability, stability, multi-modality, and computational complexity.<br/> <br/> <br/>Considering the uniqueness of smart grids that include many power electronics systems, developing data-driven algorithms that can adapt to changing conditions and network topology is more challenging. The investigators share a synergistic vision and passion and have been collaborating for extensive periods. In this project, investigators generalize their recent development on graph-on-graphs methods to a family of methods for smart grid anomaly detection and diagnosis, considering the dynamic association between multi-modality data. Unlike existing methods that have degraded performance for data with spurious noise, the proposed methods are highly sensitive and precise. More importantly, the proposed real-time methods are computationally efficient. In general, the graph-on-graphs approach provides a rich and flexible framework to address anomaly detection in multi-modality networks. The results from this project will make significant theoretical and methodological contributions to anomaly detection and diagnosis in smart grids and have a strong impact on smart grid developments. This project crosses the boundaries between statistics, computer science, and engineering and will provide a unique opportunity to attract students of different scientific, ethnic, and national backgrounds to study science and engineering to foster our next-generation scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A classic application is image processing, where a model may learn to recognize particular images through training with many sample images. ML systems are software systems that incorporate ML models to make decisions. Because they treat example data as ""code"" and because they consist of many subsystems that support the learning, ML systems exhibit not only problems typically found in classical software but also unique problems not found in traditional software. A fundamental problem in ML systems is technical debt, where software developers trade off short-term gains in bug fixes and new software features for long-term quality. Such debt makes changing ML systems complex and error-prone, which can negatively impact system effectiveness and, ultimately, how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is woven into the fabric of society. This project will improve ML systems' long-term reliability and evolvability, positively impacting computer vision, autonomous driving, medicine, and outliers identification. Tools developed as a result of this project are also expected to democratize the AI workforce, as they will assist data scientists and software engineers of varying proficiency in evolving and maintaining reliable and accurate (industrial, general) ML systems. Such tools can contribute to a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce and increase US economic competitiveness. This project will promote software engineering concepts early in machine learning practice by augmenting and creating community college-level curricula. Dissemination will occur through publicly distributing datasets, papers, open-source software, and Open Educational Resources.<br/><br/>Because ML systems are predisposed to technical debt, modifying them is difficult, expensive, and potentially error- and omission-prone. Notably, there is a critical knowledge gap concerning the extent to which (i) data and multiple model interactions influence technical debt, (ii) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can be used to reduce technical debt by encapsulating model code representing subtle ML algorithm differences, and (iii) data can be abstracted and refactored (semantics-preserving, source-to-source program transformation) alongside code to combat technical debt in real-world ML systems. Without adequate insight into the challenges of, methodologies for, and tools to alleviate ML-specific technical debt, ML systems may be fallible and challenging to maintain long-term. This project will contribute new methodologies and automated refactorings for ML systems that improve their long-term reliability and evolvability. First, (multiple model) code and data will be mined for (manual) refactorings alleviating (ML-specific) technical debt. Then, methodologies and novel refactorings at both the code and data levels for automatically (i) utilizing more object-orientation in model code and (ii) simplifying (multiple) complex (interacting) models will be formulated. Finally, a novel research infrastructure that (i) automatically extracts refactoring preconditions from API documentation, (ii) evaluates refactorings, and (iii) integrates refactoring identification capabilities with popular refactoring miners will be designed. This contribution is significant because it fills the void of techniques, methodologies, and tools for effectively developing---and evolving long-lived---trustworthy (general) ML systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DNA is a well-known example of these ?sequence-defined macromolecules.? Due to these defined chemical sequences, the molecules can self-assemble into aggregates with precisely tailored structures and properties. These materials have many potential applications, such as tunable drug delivery for personalized medicine. However, the immense number of possible sequences (more possibilities than individual grains of sand on earth) makes it difficult to reliably predict how the chemical sequence leads to structure and, subsequently, properties. This project therefore aims to pioneer a new machine learning approach to model the relationship between chemical sequences and aggregates' resulting structure and properties. The primary goal is to demonstrate the capability to recommend chemical sequences that will yield desired characteristics on demand. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students studying materials science, the investigators will also organize educational activities, such as technical workshops and online tutorials, to disseminate the scientific findings and promote data-driven soft material design among future STEM professionals.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>This award supports data-intensive and computational research and education aimed to develop a new computational framework for the inverse design of sequence-defined macromolecules whose self-assembled aggregates exhibit targeted morphologies and properties.

As an energy carrier that cuts across sectors, natural geologic hydrogen could serve as a future clean energy source. This project focuses on the exploration and characterization of new hydrogen resources in the United States, and innovative education and workforce developments to meet the demand for future careers in clean energy. The researchers build a model for hydrogen generation potential from iron-rich rocks by identifying hydrogen-producing reactions, testing their geographic extent, and building a scalable workflow for hydrogen resource exploration. To expand clean energy education experiences and contribute to workforce development, the researchers will create introductory experiential learning opportunities focused on the role of Earth science in clean energy futures and will expand upper level undergraduate research opportunities through course-based research relating to hydrogen as a future energy source. Additionally, team will facilitate discussions between academia and industry through a clean energy symposium, and will connect students to employers for on-the-job training in sustainable geoscience research, thereby providing students with training for future clean energy careers.<br/><br/>The project identifies and characterizes new natural hydrogen resources in the United States and gauges the natural hydrogen production potential of iron-rich rocks. This is the first-time natural hydrogen generation through low temperature oxidation reactions is practically tested in iron-rich geologic units in the United States. Quantification of hydrogen-producing reactions in iron-rich rocks in drill cores from across the mid-continent of the United States requires application of a multi-method, multi-scale workflow. The researchers quantify hydrogen generation potential of iron-rich rocks by calculating the total reduced iron remaining in the rock unit that has the capacity to react with subsurface fluids which requires (1) determination of mineral oxidation reactions, mineral volumes, and iron valency; (2) measurement of oxidation-reduction potential of regional subsurface fluids in direct contact with iron-rich rocks, (3) direct measurement of hydrogen gas in boreholes that intersect iron-rich rocks; and (4) identification of microbial hydrogen consumption. Subsequent tasks involve mapping of gas and fluid migration paths to quantify regional hydrogen transport and storage and determining regional trap and seal potential through application of geospatial and geophysical data analysis. The research provides foundational datasets required to systematically assess the potential for large-scale domestic hydrogen production and usage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knowledge graphs connect information through links. For example, a person is linked to a movie because they acted in the movie. This allows that person to be linked to other actors in the movie or to link the movie to the actor's other movies. These links create a knowledge graph. Many services like search engines increasingly rely on knowledge graphs, resulting in millions of users interacting with these graphs daily. Knowledge graphs are typically incomplete; that is, there are many missing links between entities that are in fact related. These missing links hinder graphs' effectiveness. For example, a search engine with missing links cannot completely or accurately answer a user question. Link prediction algorithms aim to make knowledge graphs more complete and therefore more accurate. Current evaluation protocols ignore the nature of the links predicted by a link prediction algorithm (interpretability), and rely on datasets crafted using random selection and arbitrary thresholds (bias). The current understanding of benefits and drawbacks of link prediction algorithms is thus quite limited. Without such understanding, the field of link prediction in knowledge graphs cannot properly advance as there is no clear direction on how to do so.<br/><br/>Link prediction algorithms commonly rely on machine learning, so they train link prediction models to complete knowledge graphs. There are three main issues hindering our understanding of what link prediction models can accomplish: 1) The lack of methods to interpret a set of link predictions rather than individual predictions, and to quantify model interpretability; 2) The use of random selection and arbitrary thresholds to evaluate link prediction that introduce biases; and 3) The lack of homogeneous comparisons that hinder replicability due to variations in the experimental evaluation protocol. This project proposes the following advances: 1) New methods to compute global interpretations of the link predictions that a model deems correct; 2) New methods to detect and interpret the link prediction rules a model has learned, such as ""if actor A acts in movie M, then A is in M's cast;"" 3) New interpretation metrics and analyses considering various strategies to generate incorrect knowledge and its expected plausibility; 4) New definitions of anomalies, a.k.a. data redundancy, to understand biases in benchmarking datasets while taking link prediction rules into account; 5) New methods to partition datasets into splits that preserve graph features with statistical guarantees; 6) New statistically sound methods to select subgraphs from real-world knowledge graphs for use as benchmarking datasets; 7) An open-source link prediction framework to reduce barriers when replicating results; and 8) A link prediction evaluation module available through Google Colab, and publicly-available link prediction models to promote open comparisons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One example is in therapeutic medical treatments, which rely on the ability to deliver drugs in a controlled way. Understanding the interactions between additives and polymer molecules,is critical for modeling how the molecules might leach or release from the final product. Factors that contribute to the additive?s release rate include how they are distributed among the polymer molecules, how those polymer molecules are arranged, and how the polymers break down. This research aims to determine how these interactions impact the release and degradation behavior in a two-component polymer, poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL). PEO-b-PCL has two differing components: one that is hydrophilic, or water-soluble, and one that is hydrophobic, or water-insoluble. Additionally, both components can assemble in crystalline phases (having tightly structured arrangements) or amorphous phases (more random and spacious molecular arrangements). Because of the duality of the polymer, additives may partition into different sections of the material. Using common drug molecules of varying hydrophobicity, PEO and PCL crystallinity will be monitored to determine the impact of additives on crystal formation. A decrease in crystallinity or crystal size could be observed whether the additive exists in the polymer as individual molecules (good dispersion) or as large crystalline structures (poor dispersion) and whether it segregates into PEO or PCL partially, primarily, or exclusively. Preparation of the additive-polymer mixture will be varied to see how changes in the polymer crystal structure impacts the additive assembly. Not only will changes in the crystalline structure impact the additive release, it will impact the plastic?s erosion and degradation in water. A comprehensive analysis of structure-property relationships is needed to appropriately understand the role of polymer physical structure in the process of additive release and polymer breakdown over time. In addition to scientific discovery, this research provides training and development for undergraduates - our future scientists and engineers - and promotes inclusion in STEM for all. Outreach activities including hosting a local high school student as a research assistant and engagement in a K-6 community outreach program that brings students to campus for engineering activities are also included in this project.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL:<br/><br/>Controlled drug release relies on the chemical or physical structure and interactions between drug molecules and the polymeric carrier. Molecular dispersion of the drug and complex interactions among drug, polymer, and water are primary factors that contribute to the rate of release and its control. One underlying factor that impacts the diffusion of both drug and water molecules is the physical structure of the polymer where crystalline lamellae provide physical barriers and microphase separation provides inhomogeneous dispersion of small molecules. Amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(?-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) is a model copolymer with hierarchical physical structures, including crystallization of both blocks and subsequent phase separation. These structures are impacted by preparation techniques and the inclusion of small molecule additives. Spectroscopic and thermal analysis techniques will be used to evaluate the polymers? and drug?s structures using differing preparation methods, thermal treatments, drug loading, and drug hydrophobicity. PEO and PCL domains should exhibit changes in crystal size and/or crystallinity as it correlates to the drug?s structure and dispersion (molecular or crystalline solid) and partitioning in each domain. More hydrophobic molecules are expected to segregate into the PCL domain; however, interactions during the assembly process may be more complicated. Previously determined techniques for tailoring the crystal morphology from edge-on spherulites to flat-on structures will be utilized to evaluate the crystal stability in the presence of drug additives or aqueous environments. Conversely, the absorption of water in the PEO domains should be impacted by PEO crystallites. Similar techniques will be used to monitor the diffusion of water into the film and subsequent dissolution of PEO crystals of varying metastability. Complimentary experimental procedures in chromatography and gravimetric analysis will be used to measure controlled release and degradation profiles to gain insight into the role of the polymer?s physical structure in the macroscopic properties. Understanding the interplay between the PEO and PCL crystal size, crystallinity, and morphology and resultant water absorption, degradation, and drug release properties is important for controlled delivery. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will investigate the impact of engaging teacher candidates and new teachers in video-based analysis of STEM classrooms with the goal of building skills in noticing inclusive approaches to STEM teaching. The project aims to engage ~200 future and current STEM teachers in video-based analysis through teacher preparation programs at seven institutions geographically spread across the country. The research is designed to investigate the impact of this video-based approach on STEM teacher effectiveness and retention in high-need schools. The project has the potential to produce new insights about this model of using video-based analysis for preparing and retaining effective STEM teachers in high-need schools with skills in inclusive STEM teaching.<br/><br/>This project at Vanderbilt University, Texas State University San Marcos, Teachers College Columbia University, West Chester University, University of Northern Iowa, Louisiana State University, and Kennesaw State University includes partnerships with high-need school districts local to each of our seven research sites. The project aims to address the following research questions: 1) How does K-12 teachers? professional vision for equitable science teaching change over time through video-based examinations of practice from teacher education through induction? and, 2) How does teachers? development of professional vision for equitable science teaching through video-based examinations of practice relate to their effectiveness and retention in high-need schools? Using a design-based research approach, two cohorts of prospective science teachers will engage in learning opportunities that support professional vision for equitable science teaching through video-based examinations of practice as part of their science methods coursework and field experiences. Selected teachers will then be followed into their induction year(s) at high-need school districts and continue to be provided support through networked video clubs. Direct observations of STEM teaching, as well as survey measures of teacher self-efficacy and equitable teaching practices, will be used to assess STEM teacher effectiveness. Surveys of teacher intentions to remain in the profession and social network analysis will be used to evaluate potential impacts on STEM teacher retention. Additionally, the project aspires to develop cross-site, longitudinal case studies across the seven sites and multiple geographic regions based on recordings of video analysis discussions, teacher interviews, and written artifacts from teacher preparation activities. The project has the promise of developing and evaluating a model for cultivating equitable noticing skills among STEM teacher candidates that could adapted by other STEM teacher preparation and professional development programs. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Part of the great success of quantum chemistry in the last fifty years has been its extension to the precise and accurate calculation of molecular properties such as structural and spectroscopic constants or nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts. However, most standard methods of quantum chemistry do not capture changes due to nuclear quantum effects. This can lead to errors that reduce the predictive ability of computation. Dr. Brorsen and his research group will extend a class of quantum-chemistry methods called multicomponent methods that inherently include nuclear quantum effects to the calculation of a variety of molecular properties. He will apply the methods to calculate the properties of small astrochemically relevant molecules hypothesized to be present in the interstellar medium. Building on an existing partnership with a regional area high school, Dr. Brorsen will implement a new educational program, Summer Chemistry Research at Mizzou (SCRAM), that will provide area high school students with research opportunities in computational chemistry. Through the SCRAM program, Dr. Brorsen and his group will introduce high school students to how computers can be used to calculate simple molecular properties such as bond distances.<br/><br/>Multicomponent methods include nuclear quantum effects such as finite-sized nuclei and vibrational averaging in computational chemistry calculations by using a multicomponent Hamiltonian that treats electrons and nuclei identically and on equal footing. While the field of multicomponent methods has made great progress in the last few years, most previous studies have used multicomponent density functional theory (DFT) to compute quantities related to the potential energy surface. Dr. Brorsen and his group will extend the applicability of multicomponent DFT methods by developing multicomponent DFT methods to compute magnetic properties such as nuclear magnetic resonance shielding constants, indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants, and EPR hyperfine tensors. They will use these new methods to investigate actinide oxide compounds studied at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Dr. Brorsen and his group plan to derive and implement a constrained multicomponent coupled-cluster (CC) method. He and his group will also implement the first multicomponent CC analytic gradient. This will enable computationally efficient geometry optimizations and semi-numerical Hessians to be performed using multicomponent CC methods. The group will use the multicomponent CC method to compute the rotational constants and centrifugal-distortion constants of astrochemically relevant molecules such as HC3N and HC3NH+. All code from the project will be released with the Apache 2.0 permissive free software license to allow other researchers to use the methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When using multi-drug therapeutics, it is challenging, yet necessary, to administer multiple drugs during a session to achieve the full therapeutic effect. A solution to this challenge is to deliver both drugs at the same time. One downside, however, is the need for each drug to be deposited or reach a separate part of the body with different types of release kinetics. The overarching goal of this ERI project is to investigate the use of charged polymer complexes as a novel platform for dual drug delivery with the ability to regulate the release profiles of these drugs independently of each other. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator aims to investigate two avenues: (1) the degradation of solid polymer complexes after enzyme introduction and (2) the degradation of liquid polymer complexes that break down after adding an appropriate enzyme. The successful completion of this project will benefit society by laying the groundwork for dual drug delivery systems and advancing national health and welfare. Graduate and undergraduate student education, mentoring, and training will further the societal benefits of this project. <br/><br/>Although groups have investigated polyelectrolyte complexation and degradable polymers, there has not been significant investigation of integrating these two concepts together. This ERI project will address this gap by complexing an enzymatically degradable carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) polymer with an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte, such as poly(L-lysine). This research is the first step toward developing a system where the Principal Investigator can utilize the electrostatic nature of polyelectrolyte complexes, trigger drug release, and dismantle these complexes through the enzymatic degradation of CMC. The PI seeks to use both liquid-liquid and solid-liquid phase separation as starting points for evaluating polymer complex degradation. The three objectives of this ERI project are: (1) investigating the ability to complex a charged degradable polymer with an oppositely charged peptide or protein; (2) monitoring the kinetics of how the degradable polymer breaks down both as part of the complex and free in solution; and (3) through the incorporation of a third charged species to act as a model drug and monitor the release kinetics of the drug. After conducting fundamental studies using absorbance studies, brightfield microscopy, and enzyme assays, future research can further design systems for dual drug delivery with two different release mechanisms - release via changes in electrostatics and polymer degradation. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of a dual drug delivery platform with tunable, independent release kinetics while furthering a fundamental understanding of phase separation and polymer degradation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While each of these extremes has been studied individually, this project will be the first to investigate their compound co-occurrences, trends, and links in the Southeast U.S. Furthermore, by incorporating census-derived metrics of human vulnerability, this research will identify the sub-regions and metropolitan areas within the Southeast U.S. that are most affected by the three compound extremes, which often exact their greatest toll on vulnerable populations. To communicate key results to relevant stakeholders and the public, monthly professional-quality broadcast videos will be produced and disseminated through social media and web platforms.

The third project phase will examine the compound occurrences and causal mechanisms among the three extreme event types over the past few decades. This analysis will increase understanding of the frequency and trends in the compound extremes, as well as the physical mechanisms that connect them. Finally, social vulnerability data will be integrated into the compound extremes dataset to produce a gridded compound extremes vulnerability index for the Southeast U.S. This index will be able to identify areas that are not only experiencing more frequent and severe compound extremes, but also contain large numbers of socioeconomically vulnerable persons, poor drainage, and lack access to cooling, all of which can result in even greater human impacts from compound hazards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will investigate the impact of engaging teacher candidates and new teachers in video-based analysis of STEM classrooms with the goal of building skills in noticing inclusive approaches to STEM teaching. The project aims to engage ~200 future and current STEM teachers in video-based analysis through teacher preparation programs at seven institutions geographically spread across the country. The research is designed to investigate the impact of this video-based approach on STEM teacher effectiveness and retention in high-need schools. The project has the potential to produce new insights about this model of using video-based analysis for preparing and retaining effective STEM teachers in high-need schools with skills in inclusive STEM teaching.<br/><br/>This project at Vanderbilt University, Texas State University San Marcos, Teachers College Columbia University, West Chester University, University of Northern Iowa, Louisiana State University, and Kennesaw State University includes partnerships with high-need school districts local to each of our seven research sites. The project aims to address the following research questions: 1) How does K-12 teachers? professional vision for equitable science teaching change over time through video-based examinations of practice from teacher education through induction? and, 2) How does teachers? development of professional vision for equitable science teaching through video-based examinations of practice relate to their effectiveness and retention in high-need schools? Using a design-based research approach, two cohorts of prospective science teachers will engage in learning opportunities that support professional vision for equitable science teaching through video-based examinations of practice as part of their science methods coursework and field experiences. Selected teachers will then be followed into their induction year(s) at high-need school districts and continue to be provided support through networked video clubs. Direct observations of STEM teaching, as well as survey measures of teacher self-efficacy and equitable teaching practices, will be used to assess STEM teacher effectiveness. Surveys of teacher intentions to remain in the profession and social network analysis will be used to evaluate potential impacts on STEM teacher retention. Additionally, the project aspires to develop cross-site, longitudinal case studies across the seven sites and multiple geographic regions based on recordings of video analysis discussions, teacher interviews, and written artifacts from teacher preparation activities. The project has the promise of developing and evaluating a model for cultivating equitable noticing skills among STEM teacher candidates that could adapted by other STEM teacher preparation and professional development programs. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Soil carbon is vital in regulating the Earth's climate system. Its loss due to human activities significantly impacts global warming and ecological balance. The project will quantify historical soil carbon loss due to human activities, and explore strategies to reverse this trend, aiming to transform soils into robust carbon sinks for climate mitigation. The proposed research offers extensive societal benefits, impacting climate policy and awareness, enhancing climate predictability, and aiding climate mitigation through soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission reduction. It will advance scientific discovery and promote learning through a university-level course and a high school summer camp, introducing students to climate science data. Furthermore, the research aims to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science, fostering an inclusive community. By enhancing research and education infrastructure and leveraging networks and partnerships, the project will disseminate results broadly and provide open-source data and tools to understand and mitigate climate change. This research-education nexus is designed to inspire future leaders and foster societal readiness for better climate management.<br/><br/>This research is structured around four key objectives, each addressing uncertainties in the quantification of some of the largest soil carbon fluxes associated with anthropogenic impacts. The first objective is to quantify recent trends in soil carbon stocks in intact ecosystems, providing critical insights into how these natural sinks have been influenced by climate change. The second objective is a global assessment of carbon fluxes due to wetland degradation, a significant factor in the global carbon budget and its impact on contemporary warming. The third objective focuses on evaluating historical and future greenhouse gas emissions associated with livestock grazing. These three first objectives are primarily based on data synthesis of field measurements and statistical modeling. The fourth and final objective employs a novel bookkeeping approach to track both losses and gains in soil carbon stocks linked to land-use change. This involves integrating a wide range of field-based data sources, including data generated in objectives 1-3, with land-cover satellite data, to construct a comprehensive and dynamic monitoring system of soil carbon fluxes. Together, these objectives will provide a robust, multi-faceted understanding of soil carbon dynamics, delivering compelling evidence crucial for global climate policy and contributing significantly to ecosystem ecology and climate science. The research will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar, and outreach to high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the hope that soft robots are safer around humans neglects how multi-faceted the robot?s tasks may be, and how safety depends on much more than reducing accidental forces. For example, a soft robotic arm assisting in a medical procedure must meet constraints on both too much pressure as well as not enough pressure on a patient?s body, as well as timing and in sequencing of its actions. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project supports research aimed at developing autonomous artificial intelligence systems that bring a soft robot into close contact with humans during verifiably-safe motion, no matter how safety is defined. The project?s novelty is the first application of safe-by-construction control to soft robots, as well as the focus on unique challenges therein such as controllable stiffening of the robot, lack of highly accurate mathematical models, and changes to the robot over time. This project?s impacts are in the potential to make common medical procedures low-cost and widely accessible, while reducing biases arising from subjective clinician decisions about patient comfort and pain tolerance. To reduce these biases, the project is integrating research with education for a crowdsourced citizen science activity. The activity asks high school students to construct their own soft robot and define its safety limits for themselves, and compare their results with others so that we may ultimately answer: what makes a soft robot safe, and for whom?<br/><br/>This project reframes the control of soft robots as a specification satisfaction problem, rather than motion tracking, by seeking initial answers to three research questions: (RQ1) Does the embodied intelligence of soft materials assist a soft robot manipulator in meeting a safety constraint, or detract from its ability to do so, and under what conditions? (RQ2) What tradeoffs in control strategies can balance the inherent compliance of a soft manipulator, useful in unknown environments, with strictness in safety constraints, useful when an environment is well-defined? (RQ3) What synthesis techniques for safe autonomy could express successful task transitions of a soft robot arm during uncertain contact with a human? To do so, the project pursues corresponding innovations with three research objectives: (RO1) Develop safety-verified feedback systems for a soft robotic arm, meeting constraints on position, velocity, and force, via control barrier functions and optimization-based supervisory control. (RO2) Extend this framework for control of the soft robot?s stiffness, developing a new mediation/deconfliction system for verifying safety margins under multiple possibly-time-varying soft dynamics models. (RO3) Validate the use of temporal logic and automata for safe task transitions of a soft robot in hardware, during contact with a human tissue analog. Together, this project sets a baseline for reconceptualizing the relationship between control and soft robots, with the possibility that harmonizing embodied intelligence with artificial intelligence may overcome fundamental limitations in human-robot contact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But the consequences of greenhouse warming that matter for people are regional rather than global and involve other factors besides temperature.  One such factor is warming-induced change in atmospheric circulation, which can, for example, cause some regions to dry out while others become more flood prone. The importance of circulation change for regional climate challenges efforts to address climate impacts since the dynamical mechanisms through which warming induces circulation change are not well understood, and model simulations used to inform decision making do not show strong agreement as to how much circulation change will occur.  A further consideration is that the amount of circulation change is not necessarily proportional to the amount of global temperature increase.  Previous work by the Principal Investigators (PIs) of this project found several examples of nonlinear behavior, for instance the strength of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley Cell (the overturning cell with rising motion near the equator and subsidence over the Northern subtropics) decreases for a doubling of CO2 but increases if CO2 is further increased to a tripling.<br/><br/>Work under this award seeks to understand the circulation response to CO2 increase, focusing specifically on the reasons for differences in circulation change from one climate model to another and the mechanisms responsible for nonlinearity in circulation change.  One mechanism for nonlinearity is the rapid weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which occurs at a particular level of CO2 increase and causes circulation change by creating a patch of colder sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic.  The rapid weakening of the AMOC happens at different CO2 levels in different climate models and is thus a source of inter-model spread in circulation change.  Another mechanism is CO2-induced change in stratospheric ozone, as CO2 increase affects the amount and latitudinal distribution of stratospheric ozone, which in turn can influence the jet stream because ozone causes radiative heating which produces upper-level temperature contrasts.  The CO2-ozone feedback, in which CO2 influences temperature which in turn affects ozone causing further temperature change, has only recently been recognized as a contributing factor to climate and circulation change.  The research is conducted through analysis of model simulations available through several Model Intercomparison Projects, along with new simulations generated using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the climate model of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS Model E2.2).<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the influence of circulation change on regional climate change, as noted above.  A related consideration is that assessments of regional climate change often assume that regional climate changes will be proportional to global temperature increase, thus research on the nonlinearity of circulation change has direct bearing on regional climate change assessments.  The PIs are well positioned to disseminate their results to the climate impacts community as both have been authors on previous assessments including reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organization.  In addition, the PIs participate in outreach programs within their communities including the Baltimore Ingenuity Project (IP), and the work provides support and training to two graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In other words, operations typically do not commute; this is why matrices, which encode noncommutativity in mathematics, are omnipresent in science. While matrix and operator theory has been profoundly developed in the past, the fast-evolving technological advances raise new challenges that have to be addressed. Concretely, expanding quantum technologies, complex control systems, and new resources in optimization and computability pose questions about ensembles of matrices and their features that are independent of the matrix size. The common framework for studying such problems is provided by free analysis (""free"" as in size-free), which investigates functions in matrix and operator variables. This project focuses on such functions that are built only using variables and arithmetic operations, and are therefore called noncommutative polynomials and rational functions. While these are more tangible and computationally accessible than general noncommutative functions, most of their fundamental features are yet to be explored. The scope of the project is to investigate noncommutative rational functions and their variations, develop a theory that allows resolving open problems about them, and finally apply these resolutions to tackle emerging challenges in optimization, control systems, and quantum information. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The scope of this project is twofold. Firstly, the project aims to answer several function-theoretic open problems on rational operations in noncommuting variables. Among these are singularities and vanishing of rational expressions in bounded operator variables, geometric and structural detection of composition in noncommutative rational functions using control-theoretic tools, noncommutative tensor-rational functions and their role in computational complexity, and existence of low-rank values of noncommutative polynomials with a view towards noncommutative algebraic geometry and approximate zero sets. These fundamental problems call for new synergistic methods that combine complex analysis, representation theory, algebraic geometry and operator theory. Secondly, the project aims to advance the framework of positivity and optimization in several operator variables without dimension restrictions, where the objective functions and constraints are noncommutative polynomials and their variations. The approach to this goal leads through functional analysis, real algebraic geometry and operator algebras. Moreover, the project seeks to apply these new optimization algorithms in quantum information theory, to study nonlinear Bell inequalities in complex quantum networks and the self-testing phenomenon in device-independent certification and cryptographic security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These elements replicate and integrate into various genomic sites, causing genetic mutations and significant chromosomal alterations. Understanding the mechanism of silencing, which is initiated and then maintained through generations, is important to grasp the dynamic interplay between TE silencing and transpositions that shapes genome structure and influences gene regulation. However, studying the silencing initiation is challenging due to the limited novel occurrence beyond ancient events. This study proposes utilizing two naturally occurring silencers (killer alleles) exclusive to maize, which can actively initiate TE silencing through simple crosses instead of using transgenic constructs. The research aims to investigate the initiation and consequences of epigenetic TE silencing in maize, with a focus on the sophisticated regulated mechanisms responding to developmental cues. Moreover, the proposal prioritizes student engagement, diversity support, and educational outreach. By fostering collaborations between Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and research-intensive (R1) universities, it seeks to enhance the PI's research productivity while addressing challenges faced by students in under-resourced environments. Incorporating a Collaborative Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) component enables more undergraduate students from PUIs to engage in authentic research. Additionally, a summer research fellowship program tailored for underserved students is proposed, aiming to overcome barriers arising from their lack of research access and limited connections with the academic community, thereby promoting their success in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This research aims to gain valuable insights into the intricate interplay between epigenetic mechanisms and transposon silencing during plant development. Specific goals include: 1) Studying the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) induced by maize killer alleles. Preliminary data indicate that Ackiller-derived small RNAs utilize RdDM to silence active Ac transposons, providing the first evidence of Ac silencing through this pathway. The study proposes to examine the genome-wide effects on Ds from the Ack-small RNAs to gain a comprehensive understanding of small RNA targeting, initiation, and maintenance during TE silencing, and obtain insights into the ancient silencing events on Ds during genome evolution. 2) Investigating the regulation of the silencing mechanisms based on the preliminary data that killer- small RNAs induced RdDM is tightly regulated by developmental stages. This regulation may involve alternating among different silencing mechanisms including RdDM, histone modification, and translation inhibition. By studying the ability of the same small RNAs to activate distinct silencing pathways in different tissues, this research provides a unique opportunity to explore the dynamic regulation of TE silencing in response to developmental cues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Poor predictions of tropical cyclones can lead to underprepared communities, exacerbating the impacts of these powerful storms. This project aims to understand how different types of precipitation, or rainfall, impact tropical cyclone maximum sustained wind speed. Precipitation is divided into four categories based on how fast the air is rising in clouds. Clouds that have faster rising air are called convection, with the tallest clouds called deep convection and the shallower clouds called moderate convection and shallow convection. The lightest precipitation is called stratiform rain and has the least amount of rising air. The type of precipitation can be identified based on its appearance on radar measurements. This project addresses how each type of precipitation influences the maximum sustained wind speed of the storm through their impact on storm structure. Since different types of precipitation can be identified on radar, this project may offer new insights into forecasting of tropical cyclone maximum sustained wind speed. In addition, this project will support undergraduate student research, an undergraduate mentorship program, a scholarship for a high achieving student, and outreach activities that will help communities susceptible to tropical cyclones understand and prepare for their impacts. <br/><br/>The project will use a comprehensive airborne Doppler radar dataset to examine how precipitation modes perturb kinematic fields such as the three-dimensional velocity, vertical vorticity, divergence, and absolute angular momentum. Since airborne radar data does not contain thermodynamic measurements, the project will use a full physics numerical weather prediction model to further explore if precipitation modes are more closely associated with kinematic perturbations or thermodynamic perturbations such as in humidity. Furthermore, the project will show how precipitation modes lead to differing diabatic heating profiles and will use a linear model to examine how the diabatic heating profiles lead to changes in mean vortex structure. The impacts of precipitation will be evaluated in environments with differing vertical wind shear magnitudes, which can impact the distribution of the precipitation modes. The results of this project will lead to a new holistic model about the role of different precipitation modes in tropical cyclones and how that role is controlled by different vertical wind shear environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second task focuses on developing a comprehensive framework that enhances robustness across various aspects and stages of the perception pipeline. This framework aims to protect against physical adversarial threats, ensuring the security of 3D sensing applications in critical environments. The final task, the evaluation phase, involves the creation of simulation tools and testbed platforms. These tools will validate the findings and methodologies developed in the first two tasks through extensive testing with existing and newly collected datasets and implementation in real-world scenarios. This comprehensive approach ensures that the project not only addresses theoretical challenges but also validates its findings in practical applications, paving the way for deploying secure, intelligent 3D sensing systems in many settings.

While this tool was initially intended to analyze differential equations that describe wave cancellations, it has also led to important breakthroughs in number theory. For example, Diophantine equations are potentially complicated systems of equations involving whole numbers. They are used to generate scrambling and diffusion keys, which are instrumental in encrypting data. Mathematicians are interested in counting the number of solutions to such systems. Unlike waves, numbers do not oscillate, at least not in an obvious manner. But we can think of numbers as frequencies and thus associate them with waves.  In this way, problems related to counting the number of solutions to Diophantine systems can be rephrased in the language of quantifying wave interferences. This was the case with PI's breakthrough resolution of the Main Conjecture in Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem. The PI plans to further extend the scope of decoupling toward the resolution of fundamental problems in harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and number theory.  He will seek to make the new tools accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Part of this project is aimed at developing the methodology to analyze the Schrdinger maximal function in the periodic setting. Building on his recent progress, the PI aims to incorporate Fourier analysis and more delicate number theory into the existing combinatorial framework. Decouplings have proved successful in addressing a wide range of problems in such diverse areas as number theory, partial differential equations, and harmonic analysis. The current project seeks to further expand the applicability of this method in new directions. One of them is concerned with finding sharp estimates for the Fourier transforms of fractal measures supported on curved manifolds. The PI seeks to combine decoupling with sharp estimates for incidences between balls and tubes. In yet another direction, he plans to further investigate the newly introduced tight decoupling phenomenon. This has deep connections to both number theory and the Lambda(p) estimates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This wildfire is the largest fire ever recorded in the state?s history and burned more than 1 million acres. Previous research has shown that wildfires can trigger significant rates of soil erosion. This research project responds to the urgent need to capture the first flush of eroded materials. Erosion, redistribution, and deposition of soil resources are intimately connected to landscape recovery. Collaboration and partnership with federal agencies, including the USDA and NRCS, will aid in designing long-term management of these rangelands in the region. The project will provide training opportunity to two undergraduate students at a Hispanic Serving Institution.<br/><br/>Rangelands in arid and semi-arid regions are susceptible to enhanced rates of aeolian erosion following a wildfire. However, the impacts of wildfire extend beyond wind erosion and dust emission as vegetation recovery in these rangelands could be dependent on history of land-use and antecedent vegetation type. The project will quantify the rates of wind erosion and dust emission in rangelands (grassland, shrubland, grazed vs ungrazed sites as treatments) affected by the fire. The data will be collected with sediment samplers and a portable wind erosion simulator. This information could lead to advances in our fundamental scientific understanding of the impact of wildfire on the rate of wind erosion from sites with different vegetation types and grazing intensity and determine the recovery trajectory of these landscapes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Phosphorescent metal complexes have been used in a variety of optoelectronic applications, most notably organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), a lighting technology that is widely used in color displays and other consumer products. The goal of this project is to use complementary molecular design strategies in a few different classes of phosphorescent compounds to increase their radiative rates, with long-term implications of producing OLEDs with improved efficiency and durability. The work combines innovative synthetic chemistry to make new molecules and in-depth photophysical characterization to measure the color profile, efficiency, and timescale of light emission. Standing at the interface of organometallic chemistry and photochemistry, this research aims to produce insightful structure-property relationships that lead to the discovery of top-performing phosphorescent metal complexes. Another part of this project will develop a publicly available web database of photochemically active compounds, allowing researchers at all levels to search and sort the database for compounds that have specific properties of interest. Finally, this research project will serve as a training ground for undergraduate and graduate researchers in experimental physical inorganic chemistry research to contribute to the future science and technology workforce.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Tests research team will pursues three complementary strategies for increasing the radiative rates and photoluminescence quantum yields of organometallic phosphors. The first two focus on blue phosphorescence, which remains one of the most significant technical challenges in the optoelectronic field. Platinum acetylide compounds are a promising class of blue-phosphorescent compounds, but their slow radiative rates have hindered their widespread deployment in OLEDs. This project will introduce the ?secondary heavy-metal effect? as a strategy to increase radiative rates, by decorating the periphery of platinum aryl acetylide compounds with other heavy metals. These approaches center on pyridyl-substituted acetylides which can coordinate to a variety of heavy metal additives, binding of coinage metals directly to the acetylide ?-electrons, and covalent gold-carbon bond formation on the aryl acetylide ligands. Although organoplatinum complexes are the major focus of this work, a second strategy for blue phosphorescence with fast radiative rates will involve a new class of cyclometalated iridium acetylide compounds. These compounds will combine the advantageous sharp blue phosphorescence originating from aryl acetylides with the inherently larger spin-orbit coupling and faster radiative rates that iridium engenders. Finally, the last major thrust of this project centers on cyclometalated platinum complexes, with an emphasis on luminescence in the lower-energy regions (red to near-infrared) of the spectrum. These compounds will feature electron-rich ancillary ligands that can stabilize charge-transfer states, increase excited-state spin-orbit coupling, and augment radiative rate constants. Steric effects on both the cyclometalating and ancillary ligand will also be investigated and are important for minimizing aggregation and suppressing nonradiative rates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Agriculture is a top economic driver in Virginia. Both the state government and private industry are currently investing in industries focused on hydroponics, precision-agriculture, and controlled-environmental agriculture. This project directly aligns with these initiatives and will develop an agriculture-technology (Ag-Tech) curriculum that teaches skillsets needed by today?s technicians. The project will meet the NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program mission by highlighting successful members of the STEM workforce from traditionally underserved groups in STEM and merging two traditionally divided areas of study into one career studies certificate. Specifically, this effort seeks to blend the mechatronics discipline with  agriculture disciplines. As no Ag-Tech program currently exists within the Virginia Community College system, the project will serve as a model for those seeking to develop one. The project will play an important role in workforce development by maintaining BILT (Business & Industry Leadership Team) partnerships and using industry feedback to grow the novel Ag-Tech program. <br/><br/>The project will advance the understanding of modern mechatronics skills, agricultural knowledge, and leadership skills to grow a regional workforce needed to meet the growing field of precision-agriculture. The goal of this project is to develop a novel Ag-Tech career studies certificate (CSC) that can be completed at the community college in just four semesters. The scope of the project will involve current faculty and staff, industry leaders, high school instructors, and current and future Virginia Western Community College students. The project will advance understanding of mechatronics and agricultural skills needed in an Ag-Tech career through field trips to partnering industries and development of new courses through feedback from current BILT leaders. New courses will include vertical growing, autonomous vehicles, and agricultural leadership. This project will add to the field intellectually through development of a novel Ag-Tech CSC that currently does not exist in the VCCS. With the goal of producing 45 graduates, the project will benefit the local economy of Roanoke by generating $3.3 million in direct, indirect, and induced economic impact over 3 years. Evaluation of the project will be performed twice a year through student, faculty, and industry feedback. Annual evaluation activities will analyze number of participants, retention, and satisfaction with the project to determine future direction if feedback indicates changes are needed. The progress and results of the project will be disseminated through ATE Central, internally in the college, with participants at HI-TEC (High Impact Technology Exchange Conference), and potentially in peer-reviewed journals such as Journal of Engineering Technology (JET).

They were able to associate a pre-Tannakian category to an oligomorphic group, along with some additional numerical data known as a measure.   This construction has since led to a slew of new examples as well as new insights into previously known examples. Moreover, they have shown that, in fact, these oligomorphic groups are, in a sense, unavoidable when trying to study and classify pre-Tannakian categories and need to be a part of any classification story.  This project aims to continue these investigations to construct new and interesting examples of pre-Tannakian categories with exotic properties, to develop a theory for pre-Tannakian categories associated with a wider class of linear-oligomorphic groups, and to develop tools that are better suited for constructing positive characteristic versions of the categories previously constructed.

This level of control is expected to result in control over the material's optical properties, which could enable new technologies like integrated photonic circuits that use light to transport data and chips instead of electricity. Integrated photonic circuits have the potential to result in computers and mobile phones that use much less electricity and operate faster. The research is expected to advance fundamental knowledge in materials chemistry, nanotechnology, and semiconductors. It explores approaches to gaining atomically precise control over the structure of layered semiconductors, which can potentially lead to new synthetic methods for creating layered materials with properties that could benefit many different applications. The societal benefits of this project are broad ranging. Light-emitting semiconductors made from silicon and germanium can enable faster and more efficient computing that can substantially impact energy usage and also have the potential to enable new types of information technology like quantum computing. The materials are expected to have properties that will make them useful for applications outside of information science, like sensing and energy storage. The project also integrates the education and training of educators and students at regional high schools, community colleges, and public universities to broaden the participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in the technical workforce. The integrated educational plan gives this project a broad societal impact that addresses technological needs for a sustainable future and also prepares the future workforce to advance national security, prosperity, and national health.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Integrating light-emitting components into microelectronic circuits has been a technological challenge due to stringent optical, electronic, and chemical requirements. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate a family of layered Group IV semiconductors with properties that meet these requirements. These layered Group IV semiconductors are derived from Zintl phases and have properties that could enable energy-efficient, ultrafast ""integrated photonic"" circuits. The goals of this project are to (1) synthesize layered silicon-germanium alloy semiconductors with controlled composition, structure, and surface chemistry, (2) determine how structure and chemistry influence optoelectronic properties using experimental characterization and density functional theory, and (3) characterize their thermal and environmental stability to assess their potential for real-world applications. Zintl phases comprised of atomically thin silicon-germanium alloy sheets separated by alkali metal ions or salts will be synthesized. The Zintl phases compounds will be deintercalated into multilayer semiconductors comprised of atomically thin sheets, with surfaces that can be functionalized to passivate surfaces and control their properties. In addition to computing, these materials are expected to have chemical and optoelectronic properties that could benefit numerous applications such as computing, sensing, and quantum information science. Integrated with the research are plans to work with high school STEM teachers and the NSF-funded IINSPIRE-LSAMP alliance to expand the future workforce by increasing participation of underrepresented groups and improving students' preparedness to contribute to advancing technologies that are important for national security, prosperity, and national health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to the trend of larger and larger LLMs as in ChatGPT that reason by association, the proposed ""Automated Interpretable Reasoning"" for QISE (?AIR.QISE?) will reason by deduction to minimize the change of ?confidently wrong? responses (hallucination) in tutoring and curriculum support in QISE.  The AIR.QISE will serve as a virtual tutor for students to understand the underlying concepts of quantum networks, irrespective of classroom access to top-tier educational institutions. AIR.QISE will have the capability for deductive reasoning and explaining how it arrived at a conclusion, rather than serve merely as an information retrieval tool. This will encourage students to develop critical thinking, rather than rely on rote learning. The code developed as part of this proposal will be open source, as opposed to the black-box approach of commercial products. An open access and community driven approach will help AIR.QISE generate current and bias-free educational content, since the code can be scrutinized by anyone on the internet. This will be instrumental in developing a workforce equipped with up-to-date knowledge of the latest advances in quantum network science. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>With an initial focus on the domain of quantum networks, AIR.QISE will be based on a QISE-specific knowledge base, computational reasoning algorithms including the LEAN automated theorem proving tool, and interactive simulations based on tools such as QuTip. This EAGER program would support a proof of concept demonstration of AIR.QISE to investigate integrating these techniques with state of the art natural language processing and knowledge representation in a conversational AI framework. A successful program would impact QISE research as well as education and outreach through on-demand quality tutoring. Based on our recent work, we believe that we will be able to push the hallucination rate to near-zero thanks to its construction on numerical ?self-simulation? by Sympy, Qutip, and other tools. The proposed knowledge base will moreover enable the system to produce verifiable answers, derived from numerical computation, in response to plain-english queries. <br/>The intellectual merit of AIR.QISE lies in its use of numerical tools to act as a trustworthy tutor capable of (a) first-principles reasoning and (b) provide explanations grounded in fundamental truths. The AIR.QISE framework will incorporate (a) large language model for query interpretation (b) a knowledge database for organized knowledge access and (c) a reinforcement learning module that iteratively refines the system's decision-making capabilities. The LLM will interpret the query and map it to the knowledge database, allowing it to select the most appropriate software tool for the problem statement, allowing AIR.QUISE to provide concrete examples and validate inferences by applying computational logic and numerical simulations.  AIR.QISE will address the challenge of ?AI hallucination? by self-verification and admitting when it cannot arrive at an answer.

Several privacy-related regulations set strict guidelines for data collection, processing, and storage. Violations of these regulations can lead to legal consequences and substantial financial penalties. Detecting privacy leaks often involves data flow analysis, with many existing works focusing on private data such as user names, email addresses, and device IDs. However, beyond these conventional forms of private data, domain-sensitive information also poses significant privacy risks when leaked. Domain-sensitive information refers to data within specific contexts or domains that is considered sensitive, such as a user's order history in shopping apps or heart rate data in health apps. Advertisers and marketers can exploit such data for targeted advertising, profiling, and potential misuse, leading to privacy breaches and undermining user trust. However, existing data flow analysis approaches have not incorporated domain-sensitive data as a potential source of privacy leaks due to its diverse types and formats across different apps, making its identification challenging. This project?s novelties are its approach to identify and analyze sources of domain-sensitive data within the app code. The broader significance and importance of the project lie in its potential to enhance user trust and data security in the mobile app ecosystem, ultimately improving privacy protection for millions of users worldwide.<br/><br/><br/>The research plan includes 1) conducting a crowdsourcing study to categorize domain-sensitive data within the user interfaces (UIs) of mobile apps; 2) developing a novel approach based on static and dynamic program analysis to map the UI domain-sensitive data to the corresponding domain sources (function methods within apps that access domain-sensitive data); 3) developing a machine learning model to automatically detect these sources, which will be scalable and applicable to large-scale analyses of mobile apps. The expected advances include more accurate and efficient methods for identifying and mitigating privacy risks in mobile apps.

This project has the potential for broad impact since DNA recognition is fundamental to all of life. Furthermore, the training of graduate and undergraduate students in diverse biochemical, chemical, and biological methods, will enable their entry into the biotechnology industry. The proposal also supports the science outreach, SciTrek, which brings university students into local classrooms wherein K-12 students are guided in multi-day inquiry of diverse (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) STEM topics. This program has been shown to impact students from underrepresented groups and increase their interest in STEM; a similar impact on participating girls has been documented. An additional 600 K-12 students are expected to be participate in such outreach sessions over the period of the award.<br/><br/>The bacterial DNA adenine methyltransferase, CcrM, is extremely discriminating in the sequences that undergo methylation, with the double-stranded site 5?-GANTC-3? being its normal target. The enzyme is broadly dispersed in diverse bacteria, many of which are human pathogens. The mechanism whereby CcrM induces the strands to become separated is not known, and although used by enzymes such as  CRISPR, the entire process remains obscure. Understanding DNA recognition is fundamental to life, and has implications for the development of highly selective inhibitors that disrupt this process. The project will rely on protein engineering of amino acid residues implicated in the protein-DNA co-crystal structure to be important for the strand-separation process. Fluorescence-based assays of conformational changes have been developed and will be applied to these mutants. It is anticipated that the proposed work will help to elucidate how CcrM induces strand separation and will provide tools for the study of this mechanism in other enzymes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Encryption by itself, however, does not guarantee people?s privacy, accountability, and safety. Sometimes safety goals require plausible deniability: for conversations that might be compromising, it can useful to send a message and have the receiver know who sent it, but not be able to prove who the sender was to others. Sometimes accountability goals require non-repudiation: for on-the-record conversations, a sender may want to be able to prove that they, or their partner, sent a message even if the partner claims otherwise and tries to alter the conversation transcript. This project?s goal is to help people understand and make good choices about when to choose deniability and when to choose non-repudiation and develop messaging app features that make it easy to make those choices. Through this, the project will advance knowledge around how people make sense of and use cryptography, and people?s practical ability to effectively and safely communicate.<br/> <br/>The project is organized around two parallel interface design activities, one focused on interfaces for deniability, and one on interfaces for non-repudiation.  For deniability, the team will develop interaction techniques that allow users to alter the content, timing, and authorship of messages in a transcript, leveraging underlying cryptographic techniques that support those edits. For non-repudiation, the team will develop interaction techniques that help people cryptographically sign messages using keys tied to their identity. Both interfaces will be tested through a series of user studies that address (1) people?s ability to use the tools, (2) their ability to understand the implications of using tools for deniability and non-repudiation, and (3) to use them in conversational contexts. The work will be carried out with a number of undergraduate and graduate students, and research interns, providing valuable and needed training for a future cybersecurity workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such efforts, while understandably driven by a desire for consistency and precision, can create problems when applied to individual languages. This is because each language has its own unique categories, which are often messier than linguists' definitions. Indeed, categories often blur into each other. This doctoral dissertation project investigates categories within the context of a language?s particular grammar to give a richer, more accurate description of the language. In terms of broader impacts, this project trains speakers of the language to assist in the documentation themselves, such as by transcribing existing texts and recording new texts. In addition, all data for which consent is provided is archived and made publicly accessible.<br/><br/>This project produces a grammatical description of an endangered language, and the description analyzes grammatical categories as fluid and gradient. The focus is on the grammatical domain of complex predication, a phenomenon in which multiple words conspire to make a single predicate. The investigated language has several kinds of complex predication, including light verb constructions, serial verb constructions, and clause chains. Each of these constructions exhibits a great degree of gradience, to the extent that often the lines between the different constructions are themselves not clear. In terms of intellectual merit, this project analyzes these constructions using standard methods of elicitation and text collection in the field. This project also attempts innovation in these methods based on the theoretical viewpoint of categorical gradience. The synchronic states of these syntactic entities are described using both qualitative description in prose and quantitative means of data visualization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unleashing the potential of increasingly ubiquitous data to solve grand problems from conservation biology to demography and population estimation often requires linking multiple data sources. Record linkage is the process of resolving duplicates in partially overlapping sets of records from noisy data sources without a unique identifier. A statistical model-based approach is attractive in that it allows for uncertainty quantification in the linkage. Current approaches to record linkage, however, struggle to account for data with dependence, data with missing values, and updating data, challenges that this research will address. This novel methodology will be applied to publicly available and Census Bureau data from the 19th century with identifying information about freedom seekers, captive individuals in the coastwise slave trade, and Black Americans in the Antebellum South. Official records of these individuals are fractured into many sources, each only giving a small glimpse in time. Applying the developed flexible Bayesian record linkage model, this research will reconstruct a fuller account of their lives through linking multiple noisy data sources. Building on these results, the investigator will develop a real-time updating web application to search the linked historical records. Educational activities supporting the web application include an international workshop on record linkage and historical data, a community field day, and a PhD. course on statistical tools for historical demographic data. In addition, graduate students will be mentored, and software will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>Current methodology makes three unrealistic assumptions: 1) linking fields are independent, 2) missing values are missing completely at random (MCAR), and 3) data are static. The first assumption simply does not reflect the reality of many linkage data sets. Therefore, this research will advance Bayesian record linkage through development of a flexible prior to incorporate dependence between fields in the data using copulas. Next, the research will address missing data in the linkage variables. Missing information in historic data is common, either due to factors like the loss of data over time, hand-collected data, lower literacy rates, etc. Current methods for handling missing data assume MCAR and marginalize out the effects of missingness. In contrast, this investigation will incorporate records that contain missing data in the final model via a flexible nonparametric prior. Finally, in developing the web application, the research will allow for dynamic data by developing a real-time updating querying framework for record linkage achieved through a novel filtering approach. Bayesian record linkage is an emerging field with many exciting avenues of exploration. This research will address three such avenues, resulting in more accurate linkage in complex data scenarios. The new methods will be applicable beyond the current application to a broad range of record linkage problems across the sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sustained temperatures just 1C above a coral?s typical summer maximum can lead to coral bleaching ? the breakdown of symbiosis between the coral and its endosymbiotic algal partner. Coral bleaching can often lead to coral death, and marine heatwaves causing mass coral bleaching have increased from a single mild event in the last century to as many as five per decade in modern times. Remarkably, thermally variable habitats provide a glimmer of hope that heatwave-resilient coral populations may exist, as exposure to high daily temperature variability can ?prime? reef-building corals to better withstand heat stress. This project investigates the effects of the most extreme marine heatwave to occur on the southern Great Barrier Reef to understand whether the elevated coral bleaching thresholds due to priming equate to coral community resilience against bleaching during a heatwave. The work enhances our understanding of how priming influences coral responses to heat stress, the ecological relevance of current priming benefits in a warming ocean, and the physiological properties of corals that may promote heat tolerance. Broader impacts of this project include research support and training for several early career scientists as well as informing local, regional, and global action from stakeholders in making conservation and management decisions, particularly surrounding ecosystem intervention and restoration. For the 500 million people who rely on coral reefs for food, tourism, and coastal protection, a better understanding of how diverse coral communities develop thermal tolerance and withstand the increasing threat of marine heatwaves supports more effective conservation and management of coral reef ecosystems in a changing climate. <br/><br/>It has become increasingly important to identify heat-tolerant coral populations capable of surviving intensifying marine heatwaves. This project tests the hypothesis that life-long exposure to daily temperature fluctuations improve the ability of corals to cope with the additional heat stress associated with severe marine heatwaves. This research advances understanding of the priming exposure (e.g., magnitude of diel thermal variability) most beneficial for bleaching resistance and survival and the physiological properties that promote this resilience across biological scales. Specifically, this project: (i) compares coral community bleaching resilience (i.e. prevalence and severity) during this heatwave with a decade of seawater temperature, coral demography, species composition, and benthic cover data, and (ii) compares the gene expression and physiology of three genera of corals (Acropora, Pocillopora, and Porites) across six sites with different maximum diel temperature fluctuations (2.4?7.7C/day). This research advances understanding of the mechanisms underlying coral community resilience to heat stress and enables more effective conservation and management of coral reef ecosystems during the extreme heatwaves accompanying changing climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These energetic electrons are trapped by the Earth's magnetic field, normally existing in two zones, referred to as the inner belt (within one Earth Radii from the surface of the equator) and outer belt (between 2-6 Earth Radii from the surface of the equator). Their source, loss, and variations have been a long-standing research topic. The discovery (supported by an NSF grant) of Cosmic Ray Albedo Neutron Decay (CRAND) produced electrons being the primary source of electrons near the inner edge of the inner belt has changed much of the conventional understanding of inner belt electron dynamics. The current project is to conduct a broader investigation of the dynamics of the inner belt electrons and to train and educate graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in the next-generation Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. The research results will also enhance the current prediction ability of the variation of the inner radiation belt electrons, which has its own practical space weather application for spacecraft design and operation. Thus, the project will broadly impact education, societal applications, and its intrinsic science investigation. <br/><br/>This project investigates the inward transport of energetic electrons from the outer electron belt and their energy dependence on how deep they can penetrate given a geomagnetic storm event. Recent observations show that 10s-100s of keV electrons are frequently seen in the slot region (2<L<3) and inner belt (L<2), while no significant enhancements of >1MeV electrons have been recorded inside L=2. Specific questions to be addressed in this study include:<br/><br/>1)   Where is the breakpoint in terms of energy of electrons for a given event, below which electrons can be transported into the inner belt from the outer belt, but above which electrons cannot?<br/>2)   What are the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the energy-dependent deep (L<3) penetrations of energetic electrons (10s of keV to multi-MeV)? <br/><br/>This proposal's Intellectual merit is the importance of addressing the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the energy-dependent deep penetrations of energetic electrons, which is a prerequisite for a complete understanding of the acceleration mechanisms of these electrons in that region.

The potential advantages of this medical device include early identification of growth concerns, standardization of measurement taking and interpretation across medical providers, and the prevention of late diagnoses of treatable growth disorders.

However, the speed of computer architecture simulations has not kept up with the rapid advancements in computing technology, particularly for systems that execute applications with large computations, large memory requirements, and large communication needs. This project introduces innovative lightweight simulation techniques that focus on efficiency by selectively simulating certain aspects of chip design or using higher levels of abstraction, drastically speeding up the simulation process. This project will enable the research community with techniques that support quicker development of new computing technologies. The research outcome will make the field of computer architecture more accessible to researchers with fewer resources. Moreover, the simulation techniques derived from this project will be integrated into the computer architecture curricula, helping students, especially under-resourced students, better understand concepts related to large-scale computing.<br/> <br/>Traditional computer architecture simulators recreate cycle-by-cycle details of the hardware execution, hindering fast simulation. To improve performance, this project introduces a novel suite of simulation tools designed to support the design and optimization of next-generation, large-scale computing systems. The approach encompasses three complementary strategies: behavior modeling, sampled simulations, and data-driven simulation. Behavior modeling abstracts hardware components to focus on essential performance metrics, enabling faster simulations without significant loss of accuracy. Sampled simulations leverage the repetitive nature of applications (with a special focus on GPU applications) to predict performance by simulating only critical segments of the workload. Data-driven simulations take advantage of statistical and performance modeling techniques to further advance simulation capabilities.

In most of these applications, swift processing of data captured by IoT sensors is crucial to prevent natural disasters in a timely manner. While conventional cloud-based data processing pipelines offer cost-effective and performance-efficient solutions, it is often challenging to meet stringent performance requirements of hazard monitoring systems such as low latency and high bandwidth. Edge computing emerges as a compelling solution to bridge this gap by bringing computational processing closer to the data source.  This project develops an edge computing framework tailored to address the computational requirements of time-sensitive distributed scientific applications such as wildfire monitoring. The edge computing framework has the potential to benefit other domains beyond wildfire monitoring, such as autonomous vehicles and emergency response systems.<br/><br/>The project develops an edge computing framework that optimizes the task scheduling problem by combining high precision system monitoring with comprehensive application profiling. It develops a scalable resource monitoring system to monitor the status of compute resources (e.g., edge servers and cloud instances) and network resources using lightweight monitoring agents and P4 programmable network devices. Additionally, the project conducts application profiling to extract essential metrics regarding resource utilization and execution time of tasks across various edge server and cloud instance configurations. The scheduling is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and various optimization methods such as mixed-integer linear programming, genetic algorithms, and heuristic methods are explored. Finally, the team targets a wildfire detection project (AlertWildfire) as a use case to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Computer and Network Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there is a need for apples trees that are tolerant to a changing environment such as increased temperature and disease. The solution is to genetically select apple trees for long growing seasons, hot summers, and tolerance to diseases that damage and kill trees. In addition, the new varieties may reduce labor costs and the cost of planting new orchards, which may lower production costs. The goal is to provide flavorful fruit for consumers while reducing potential orchard problems.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of apple tree varieties that have better tolerance to the effects of changing weather patterns. Changes in climate have brought on warmer, wetter, and windier weather patterns in most apple-growing areas, which reduce fruit quality, increase pesticide usage, and reduce tree survival. This apple tree technology also has addressed a primary need voiced by fruit growers ? the shortage of trained, skilled laborers. To address these separate objectives, the team has used classical plant breeding techniques to combine traits that produce labor-saving, scion-dwarfed trees and high-quality fruit in hot weather. In addition, scion dwarfing may require fewer grower production inputs and potentially improve apple tree survival. These qualities have been demonstrated in a series of field trials that have piqued fruit grower and consumer interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its mission is to perform pre-competitive, industry-oriented research to additively manufacture heterogeneous products with diverse functionality via integration of novel materials across all material classes, complex structures, and cutting-edge processes. SHAP3D?s industrial partners represent all sectors of the additive manufacturing (AM) supply chain, including materials, machines and processes, designers, and end users in commercial sectors such as aerospace, defense, and consumer products. SHAP3D will tackle real-world problems and help educate the future workforce. The SHAP3D Center will advance fundamental understanding and create economic value for industry by: (a) enabling the rational design, creation, and use of new materials, geometries, processes, and performance associated with additively manufactured products; (b) generating this knowledge through close collaboration between university and industry/government partners; (c) establishing a synergistic network of excellence in AM knowledge, experience, and facilities of added value to each partner; and (d) training students as the next generation of industry leaders in AM.

The aim is to improve surgery outcomes through pre-surgery intervention also known as prehabilitation.  Annually, over 19 million older Americans undergo surgery, with frail individuals facing high complication risk, and this number is growing.  Research indicates that for older adults, pre-surgery intervention to improve post-surgery outcomes can reduce financial burdens on the healthcare system. Studies have demonstrated that prehabilitation programs for older adults reduce hospital costs by 28% and length of stay by 31%.  Further, the Geriatric Verification Program, supported by the American College of Surgeons, mandates screening and optimization of frailty traits before surgery.  Currently, most clinics and hospitals do not have the expertise or resources to provide this service for older surgical patients.  The proposed web-based software may provide a solution to meet this requirement, reduce healthcare costs, and address the challenge of providing optimum surgical care for older Americans.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the proposed technology.

The technology is designed to evaluate vulnerabilities and create a personalized home-based plan to guide older adults as they prepare for surgery. Patients are supported by a health coach as needed. In addition to standard prehabilitation domains such as diet and exercise, the software includes wrap-around support that targets common geriatric challenges such as home safety, anxiety, and polypharmacy.  In addition, it can be tailored to specific surgery types.  The prehabilitation software incorporates clinical expertise in geriatric surgery developed at the University of California - San Francisco Surgery Wellness Program as well as information gathered from healthcare provider teams, surgeons, and older adult patients.  Clinical trials are currently in progress that may lead to a product that increases access to a prehabilitation solution to improve surgical outcomes in older adults.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, deleting data from machine-learning models and systems is non-trivial. Further, law scholars have criticized the continued use of machine learning models trained on deleted data instances as it violates privacy. This project significantly contributes to theoretically and empirically understanding the risk of privacy leaks in the context of machine learning models. The project's broader significance and importance are that the developed algorithms guarantee users the right to have their data and the influence of data completely deleted in systems such as social media, healthcare, finance, etc.<br/> <br/>This project addresses new research problems related to machine unlearning. It investigates privacy leakage risk and validity of (1) model explanation, (2) model pruning, and (3) transfer learning when user data has been deleted and machine unlearning happens. This project also tackles the subsequent tasks of designing unlearning algorithms to eliminate the influence of forgotten data from explanations, pruning models, and transferring knowledge. Frequent deletion requests often encounter expensive costs, and existing approximate unlearning algorithms cannot be applied to the formulation of explanation, pruning, and transfer learning. The investigator is developing efficient removal algorithms to perform an update step of forgetting data on the explanation, pruned structure, and transfer learning. This project also features a pipeline to handle frequent data deletion requests in high-stakes domains where user information is especially sensitive.

Understanding and ultimately predicting kinematics is of practical significance for industry and society. However, numerical simulation of all fluid scales in practical problems using uniform spatial resolution is severely intractable due to the energy transfer from the largest turbulent eddies that cascade down to the smallest eddies, where kinetic energy dissipates into heat. For example, the fluid length scales for a wind turbine span hundreds of meters down to microns, a multi-scale problem encompassing more than ten orders of magnitude. Adaptive mesh refinement alleviates this issue by discretizing the spatial domain into mesh elements of variable resolution and dynamically and strategically placing mesh points to capture the most meaningful fluid dynamics for a reasonable solution. This project addresses the challenge of accurately and efficiently simulating computational fluid dynamics problems by developing an open-source, general-purpose framework with dynamically adaptive mesh refinement on unstructured grids composed of mixed element types. The recent shift in high-performance computing hardware towards graphics processing units has brought significant advancements in computing throughput and energy usage but necessitates new algorithms and software. This project bridges the critical gaps in this transition by co-designing efficient numerical methods for these architectures in a dynamically changing mesh environment. Furthermore, this program integrates education into its mission. Post-secondary students and early-career researchers will be exposed to and trained for developing GPU-enabled software, aiming to cultivate a diverse and globally competitive workforce.<br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to create a GPU-enabled open-source computational fluid dynamics framework for modeling the compressible Navier Stokes equations, discretized using the high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method, on dynamically adapting mixed-element unstructured meshes.

Further, an emphasis is placed on solving application problems containing relative body motion, such as blade-resolved wind turbine and helicopter simulations, while addressing software complexity issues, inadequate error estimation capabilities, and geometry complexity. The framework aims to provide a more streamlined and simpler-to-use workflow, requiring minimal human intervention, which runs seamlessly on modern large-scale supercomputing architectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research introduces small quantities of active nanofillers and quantifies the potentially improved performance of these metals, which would allow them to survive and thrive in extreme corrosive environments, thus transforming the engineering practicality and reliability of these metals. The scientific understanding of additively manufactured metal nanocomposites could revolutionize 3D printing technologies and revitalize the manufacturing competitiveness of the United States.

The research exploits the reinforcing potential of boron nitride nanotubes as active fillers in additively manufactured aluminum nanocomposites via the formation of strong nanotube-metal oxide interfaces in corrosive environments. The complementary experiments and simulations will provide direct and quantitative multiscale understanding of the hypothesized self-strengthening mechanism for these nanotube-metal nanocomposites fabricated by laser additively manufactured techniques, and elucidate how the mechanical properties of these nanocomposites respond to environmental changes (temperature, moisture content, etc.). The nanomechanical experiments of pulling out individual nanotubes from the additively manufactured metal matrix to directly measure the interfacial strength properties allow quantification of the interaction between the resultant oxide layer along the tube-metal interface and the porous microstructures. In turn, the interfacial load transfer characteristics are quantified to account for bulk mechanical performance improvement of the additively manufactured metal nanocomposite. The multiscale experiments and computations will elucidate the complex interplay of metal passivation, local interfacial load transfer, and microstructural changes, which ultimately control the stiffness, strength, and toughness of the bulk additively manufactured composite in a corrosive environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A primary focus of the meeting is on comparative and mechanistic approaches to the study of neural circuits that mediate interactive acoustic behavior across taxa that represent 800 million years of evolution. This approach to the study of the neural mechanisms underlying acoustic communication lends insight into general mechanisms of neural function and leads to the development of novel analytical and experimental approaches. The organizers aim to create an environment that generates conversations that will achieve a mechanistic and unifying understanding of the neural underpinnings of acoustic communication by uncovering broadly relevant algorithms. These exchanges will advance acoustic communication research by encouraging new ideas and collaborations, highlighting diversity in the field, and inspiring and mentoring  the next generation of scientists. The request funds will be used to increase institutional diversity and support of early career investigators and students. <br/><br/>The 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) focused on the Neural Mechanisms of Acoustic Communication (NMAC) will also include an associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for pre- and postdoctoral trainees. The aim of the meeting is to assemble top researchers in the field to discuss their latest findings while also providing the opportunity for young investigators and graduate students to present their work alongside these established investigators.  The format of this small meeting  is optimized for discussions and debates and the 2024 NMAC has three specific aims: 1) To advance acoustic communication research by offering an environment that encourages questions and discussion, challenges current thinking, and provides opportunities for new collaborations; 2) to create a unique forum for interaction for researchers from a diversity of communication systems and break down boundaries between communities focused on different model systems, brain regions, research approaches; and 3) to educate new and early career investigators. There exists no meeting like the NMAC GRC for those interested in the neural circuits underlying communication. NMAC is therefore unique within the GRC family because it is focused on a behavior, rather than a brain region (e.g., cerebellum), a method (e.g., optogenetics), or a cellular process (e.g., neuroplasticity). The funds from this project will support a unique opportunity for a diverse gathering of top researchers in a highly interdisciplinary fashion to find new common ground concerning a critical and evolutionary ancient behavior whose production and perception is a fundamental feature of brain function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Survey data are a major source of policy information in the United States. However, traditional methods of data collection, such as face-to-face and telephone interviews, face challenges in declining response rates and rising cost. Probability-based online panels have emerged as an attractive option due to their flexibility, convenience, speed, cost-effectiveness, and statistical efficiency. Despite these advantages, survey nonresponse and attrition in online panels remain significant challenges. Given the increasing use of online data for policy decision-making, it is essential to collect valid and accurate online population data. This study will rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions aimed at improving response rates, reducing attrition, and enhancing data quality in online panels across disciplines. All de-identified micro data, together with replication files and project documentation, will be made publicly available to the broader research community with minimum delay to encourage further analyses and utilization of the study's research products. The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students through a partnership with the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, support is provided to enable a promising student to establish a strong, independent research career.<br/><br/>This project will conduct two online experiments to analyze the causal effects of survey burden and different incentive payment plans. The first experiment will be conducted within the Understanding American Study (UAS), a probability-based online panel representative of US adults aged 18 and above. A sample of 2,000 new respondents will be used to analyze the impact of survey burden on survey nonresponse and attrition in probability-based online panels during the first year of panel membership. UAS provides tablets and free broadband internet access to new respondents without Internet access. Respondents will be recruited via address-based sampling by drawing from post office delivery sequence files provided by a vendor. Participants in this survey burden experiment will be randomly assigned to either a low or high survey burden condition, and the intervention period will span 12 months. The low and high burden groups will receive 1 and 2 survey invitations per month, respectively. The second experiment will be conducted among a random sample of about 500 master?s students at the University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, campus. Participants in the U-M study will be randomly assigned to one of three incentive payment plans that vary in the timing of receipt of incentive payment. Participants will complete three online longitudinal well-being surveys over the course of the academic year 2023-2024. The project?s use of experimental data will address selectivity issues present in previous studies that used observational data. Additionally, the project will leverage available administrative records and longitudinal survey data for all respondents to explore treatment heterogeneous effects and assess selection bias. Findings from this project will provide empirical evidence to enhance the effectiveness of online panels in social science research and policymaking and inform future research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At large universities, opportunities for undergraduate research are ad hoc and limited in number, while at two-year institutions access to these experiences is even more limited or non-existent. Undergraduate research experiences has proved to provide many benefits to participating students, including increased likelihood of pursuing graduate study, improved retention in STEM majors, clarification of career goals, and increased knowledge and technical skills. Exploratory Reading Groups (ERGs) where students participate in low time-commitment half-quarter-long reading groups on topics centered on an active research area of a faculty member are socially relevant and thus a motivating factor in increasing student interest in STEM undergraduate research. The project will scale this program to serve 50% of engineering undergraduates at UC Santa Cruz, cumulatively hundreds of transfer-intending students at Cabrillo. This project will understand the impact of large-scale Exploratory Reading Group participation on student success in engineering, on entry into undergraduate research experiences, and on supporting transfer pathways.<br/><br/>Specific goals for this project include growing engineering Exploratory Reading Groups (ERGs) at UCSC, performing a summative large-scale and longitudinal evaluation of their impact, and supporting transfer pathways through establishing ERGs at Cabrillo.

An associated web platform and supporting scripts for running ERGs will be publicly available. To evaluate effectiveness, the project will perform a large-scale longitudinal analysis of the impact of ERGs on student success in engineering, on entry into undergraduate research experiences, and on transfer pathways. The project will also perform an analysis of barriers to faculty adoption of ERGs and on student participation in ERGs. In addition to scholarly publications at computing and engineering education venues, the project will produce an extended ERG playbook for growth and community college collaborations, perform broad audience dissemination, e.g. via the IUSE Disruptor Blog, or a SIGCSE workshop, and produce open-source materials and digital tools for running ERGs.

The high cost of rare-earth elements and heavy reliance on the imports of Nd and other rare-earth elements make the replacement of NdFeB magnets with low-cost magnets made of more abundant elements an urgent economic and national security need. Equiatomic FeNi alloy phase with L10 ordered crystal structure provides powerful permanent magnet properties comparable to NdFeB magnets. While this phase has been observed in neutron irradiated FeNi single crystals and asteroids, it has defied terrestrial synthesis in bulk form due to its low critical ordering temperature of around 320 degree centigrade and consequently low diffusion kinetics. This project overcomes the barrier for L10 long-range ordering in FeNi alloy by enhancing diffusion kinetics at temperatures below the critical ordering temperature. This is achieved by increasing the dislocation density and nonequilibrium vacancy concentration through extreme deformation and by alloying additions that enhance diffusion kinetics. FeNi single crystals are grown using the vertical Bridgman crystal growth technique. Dislocation and other defect densities are characterized using x-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Short- and long-range order are examined using diffuse scattering peaks and superlattice peaks in the x-ray diffraction patterns. Ordering and local atomic environments are also examined using extended x-ray fine spectrum (EXAFS). Vibrating sample magnetometry is used to assess the magnetic properties. The work also elucidates the operating mechanism in meteorites to form this ordered phase in the FeNi alloy. Strategic need to minimize the current reliance on rare-earth element or rare-earth magnet imports underscores the impact of the proposed research. The project trains several graduate and undergraduate students, enhances course content in several courses, and improves university research facilities. Outreach efforts are made to high school students, female and under-represented student groups, and to the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fluorine is abundant in the earth?s crust and exhibits important chemical properties for pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. However, few examples of fluorinated natural products exist, and nature?s strategies for synthesizing complex natural products from simple fluoride ions are not fully understood. The proposed research will involve undergraduates in studying the biosynthesis of organofluorine molecules by cloning enzymes from bacterial pathways.

PBT has become the testing method of choice across much of the functional programming community, and it is making inroads into industrial practice at companies such as Amazon, Volvo, Strip, Galois, and IOG.  However, one thing remains a significant concern:  A recent need-finding study of professional software developers who use PBT revealed great enthusiasm about the usefulness of PBT but frustration with its usability.  This project?s impacts are accelerating the adoption of PBT by amplifying its power and solving key usability issues. To achieve these impacts, the project advances, in parallel, the tools developers use to write specifications, generate random inputs, and assess the strength of their test suites. The project?s novelties are the development of more configurable (?reflective?) generators, specification languages, and in-editor interfaces for visualizing and tuning distributions of generated inputs. In addition, this project launches new curricula for teaching mature and powerful PBT practices in the undergraduate and master?s classrooms.<br/><br/>The project is developing novel techniques for PBT by bringing together methods from programming languages and human-computer interaction (HCI). First, it is working to establish an understanding of user needs with HCI studies of PBT in industry and real-time observations of developers interacting with PBT tools. Second, it is developing new abstractions for random input generation that enable a range of novel use cases?generating inputs satisfying validity conditions and tuning distributions based on examples or coverage?alongside benchmarks for evaluating PBT tools. Third, it is developing more usable specification tools, including a language for temporal properties over program traces and a programming assistant that helps programmers imagine and implement properties. And fourth, it is contributing new tools for effective interaction between developers on their tests, and in particular tools for visualizing and manipulating generated data distributions. The ultimate goal is to advance the state of the art in PBT and put it on every software developer?s toolbelt.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to hedge against the consequences of wildfire incidents in a timely and effective manner, guidance and support should be provided to power system operators to build in system resilience and to account for high unpredictability driven by the underlying environmental stressors, those inherent to electric power grids, and those resulting from human decisions. It is vital to observe the uncertainty that cannot be resolved simply with the passage of time; rather, its resolution depends on whether decisions to take preventive measures against wildfires are actually made and how they affect the resolution of uncertainty, i.e., decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). This calls for advances in new, fast, and efficient mathematical optimization approaches that can adapt to differing levels of risk and emergency response times and capture a wide spectrum of wildfire scenarios. This project involves graduate students.<br/><br/>To address these imperatives, the principal objective of this project is to devise a mathematical optimization framework for risk-averse stochastic programming problems that account for and respond to DDUs in which the probability distributions of random variables are distorted by decisions. The mathematical advances of this project are (i) the development of novel optimization models that feature customizable risk aversion levels and that reflect the impact of DDU on power system?s resilience against wildfires, and (ii) the design of scalable reformulation, algorithmic, and solution methods to solve these complex optimization problems. In essence, the outputs of this research will provide electric power grids with optimization and decision-making tools to effectively respond to wildfire threats while minimizing the required level of investments in capacity expansion and technology enhancements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate model simulations do not reproduce the observations with good fidelity in the North Atlantic. Reducing model biases requires fundamental research that informs model development, especially on processes relevant to resolution and parameterizations, such as flow over topography. Recent work suggests that local topography and coastlines may have greater control on the North Atlantic Ocean?s circulation than previously appreciated. This study will explore how a key basin-scale topographic feature, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), impacts the ocean and climate in two different climate model families. The MAR will be removed in an otherwise realistic configuration, allowing attribution of its impact on the ocean and climate. This project supports societally beneficial broader impacts including informing climate model development, scientific workforce training, improving STEM education, and increasing public scientific literacy. The research will inform ocean and climate model development, which is particularly needed given large model biases in the North Atlantic Ocean state that lead to model SST errors and degradation of downstream climate. Scientific training for graduate and undergraduate students will occur in this project. Cross-campus education and public outreach will be supported through a transdisciplinary ocean, climate, and music project with faculty and students in the Mead Witter School of Music. Scientific training of both science and music students will occur through traditional graduate scientific training, through novel undergraduate research opportunities with sonification, and through collaboration with student composers on ocean and climate inspired music. Public performances with scientific discussion will be planned for multiple venues, including classrooms. These events will bring scientific concepts to new audiences, increasing public scientific literacy.<br/><br/>Preliminary results with these two models show large but differing impacts to the gyres and overturning. These results will be investigated in greater depth to determine how the MAR affects the North Atlantic Ocean and climate, including with potential vorticity budgets, and to investigate whether the MAR?s presence is necessary for Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV). Experiments would also be performed to compare the influence of North American coastlines relative to the MAR. Finally, the absence of a Pacific mid-ocean ridge is an untested feature that distinguishes Atlantic and Pacific geometry. The effect of a Mid-Pacific Ridge will be investigated to assess if its addition makes the two oceans more similar. Finally, simpler versions of the Modular Ocean Model will be used to deduce the fundamental physics in the complex models. While the study of bathymetric features on the ocean can be traced back to classic papers in the 1960s and 1970s, several key threads in this area have been dropped. Mid-ocean ridges have not been investigated as a possible feature that could explain why overturning exists only in the Atlantic and not the Pacific, despite the MAR?s many key interactions with North Atlantic currents. Similarly, studies that point to aspects of continental configuration as the explanation for this key climate asymmetry often use idealized geometries and simplified physics. The approach here ? starting from the realistic end of the model hierarchy and gradually removing single pieces ? differs from past idealized work and will lead to differing conclusions or strong confirmation of past results, both valuable contributions to the field. The analogous atmospheric work (removal of the Rockies or Himalaya alone) are classic results often presented in atmospheric dynamics classes. The MAR removal experiments here has the potential to fill a similar hole in oceanography texts. Finally, testing the hypothesis that the MAR is essential for AMV, will inform the continuing debate on whether North Atlantic variability can be ocean-driven or externally forced. If AMV weakens with the MAR?s removal, it would point to the ocean as a fundamental driver of AMV.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing enrollments in computing courses have resulted in a low instructor-to-student ratio, especially for introductory computing courses, which often include non-computing majors who need to learn fundamental computing skills. In large courses, students are more likely to interact with teaching assistants rather than the instructor. Modern computing courses have a high cognitive load and require the students to use various complex tools. To succeed in computing courses, students must be independent, highly self-regulated learners who can navigate multiple help resources. This project will advance the understanding of the help-seeking landscape and how students from different backgrounds seek help in computing courses.<br/><br/>The project goals are to 1) characterize the help resource landscape available in computing courses; 2) understand students? behaviors and usage of help resources; and 3) evaluate an intervention to improve students? understanding and usage of help resources to empower them with valuable self-regulated learning skills to increase their learning.  The project will use a quantitative approach to describe the current help resource landscape in computing courses. Interviews with students will clarify their help-seeking patterns and their perceived learning effectiveness. The project will create best practices for help resources and equitable computing course design, including an intervention to 1) explicitly teach students about the help resource landscape, 2) guide them to identify what help they need, and 3) empower them to consciously utilize the landscape and their self-identified help needs to be more effective in their help-seeking.

LLMs are models that cane be used for interactions with human users through written language; for example, a user inputs an instruction or question in English to the LLM-based program, and the LLM outputs a response in fluent English. With these linguistic capabilities, LLMs are being developed for use in applications that are both ubiquitous (e.g., internet search, customer support, writing tools) and high-stakes (e.g., mental health care, classroom education, assistive technology for people with disabilities). Despite their growing adoption, many fundamental properties of LLMs aren?t yet well understood, and pressing questions remain about when and whether LLMs can be entrusted with such important tasks. For example, when instructed to make simple predictions about every-day situations, like cooking a meal or riding in a vehicle, LLMs can make strange and surprising errors, exhibiting concerning lapses in basic common sense judgment and reasoning abilities. Additionally, these predictions made by LLMs can reflect social stereotypes and cultural assumptions which, at best, limit the usefulness of the technology for certain populations and, at worst, cause active harm. This project seeks to address unfairness and bias due to stereotyping and cultural context by proposing a generalized framework for defeasible commonsense inference in natural language in which a system compares two similar situations with respect to their support for a given inference. The proposed work aims at developing scientific methods to measure and improve the abilities of LLMs to (1) reason correctly about every-day situations, (2) do so in a manner that is fair and unprejudiced, and (3) adapt these reasoning abilities across specific cultural contexts. By measuring these fundamental capabilities of LLMs, we can better understand and mitigate the risks of applying this technology in high-stakes settings.<br/><br/>The three phases of the project focus on the (1) robustness, (2) social fairness, and (3) cultural awareness dimensions of reasoning in LLMs. The project assumes a basic task formulation in which a situation description is provided to an LLM (e.g., ?Someone drops a glass?), and the LLM must either evaluate a possible inference, or generate an inference from scratch (?The glass breaks?). In phase 1, methods will be developed to automatically manipulate situation descriptions in order to train and evaluate an LLM?s ability to make nuanced inferences, with the goal of learning to distinguish which factors influence a particular inference and which ones do not (e.g., when trying to predict if a dropped glass is going to break, the thickness of the glass matters but the color of the glass does not.) In phase 2, methods will be developed to automatically test whether LLMs make socially fair inferences, for example via name substitution tests, and to intervene when a proposed output is detected as unfair. In phase 3, survey participants from the U.S. and Ghana will answer multiple stages of questions about every-day situations; the collected data will be used to develop evaluation questions for a case study on the adaptability of LLMs across these two cultural settings. For each phase of the project, the resulting datasets, methods, and scientific findings will be made available to the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will address this shortage of STEM teachers in rural areas in Kansas by recruiting and developing a cohort of Noyce Scholars who will be prepared to serve in these areas. To respond to these needs, the project will design a rural teacher certificate program and implement an online mentorship program to support prospective teachers embedded within the program, which continues after they obtain a teaching certification. Project partners will all collaborate to market information about STEM careers, organize a STEM education group, and identify prospective teachers with an interest in secondary teaching. Additionally, community colleges partners will award tuition assistance as a recruitment tool.<br/><br/>This project at Fort Hays State University (FHSU) includes partnerships with five rural-serving community colleges in Kansas (Barton Community College, Colby Community College, Dodge City Community College, Garden City Community College, and Seward County Community College), the Southwest Plains Regional Service Center (a consortium of rural school districts), and Ingalls School District. Project goals include awarding 29 undergraduate scholarships to mathematics and science prospective teachers over five years, designing a rural teacher certificate program, and implementing an online mentorship program to support prospective teachers embedded within the program and continuing after they become practicing teachers. The theoretical basis of this project aims to address recruitment, retention, and effectiveness for rural schools and focuses on three areas, or three C?s, of educator preparation: context, curriculum, and conveyance. The project?s intellectual merit adds to the knowledge base of preparing teachers for rural placements; the broader impact is modeling a steward of place as a regional university.

However, with the advancement of nanoscience, it may become possible to generalize the concept of the building blocks for designing novel functional materials. Nanometer sized components with precisely engineered sizes, shapes, compositions, and concomitant properties can be used as ?meta-atoms? for building unprecedented materials. Just as atoms combine to form molecules or crystals with dramatically different properties than the atomic constituents, the assemblies of nanomaterials can lead to new objects whose properties are determined by the interplay of the properties of individual building blocks and the interactions between these building blocks. In contrast to true atoms, nanomaterials can be continuously varied and changed in ways that traditional atoms in the periodic table cannot. This workshop, co-organized by Dmitri Talapin (University of Chicago), Richard Robinson (Cornell University) and Kristie Koski (University of California Davis) with support by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, is designed to facilitate an exchange among both emerging and established scientists working on nanomaterial assemblies. A series of presentations and roundtable discussions across six focus areas will launch discussions among experts from various niches within materials chemistry to advance the field of nanomaterial assemblies. This event will tackle key questions that lie at the heart of basic nanomaterial assembly science. The workshop engages diverse groups of researchers to ensure a rich mix of backgrounds, regions, and scientific expertise among the discussion leaders and participants. Expected from the workshop are enhanced methodologies for the controlled creation, analysis, and understanding of nanomaterial assemblies and their future applications, alongside bolstered interactions within this cross-disciplinary field.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The workshop on Assemblies of Nanomaterials will identify challenges and opportunities in the fundamental science of nanomaterial assemblies, including mesocrystals, hybrid materials, 2D material assemblies, and multi-component nanomaterials. It will also help establish a roadmap to (i) identify new tools and approaches in nanomaterials and assemblies, (ii) set standards for data and reproducibility with an outlook on AI integration, (iii) address how we can bring communities together across the multidisciplinary field of 0D, 1D, and 2D nanomaterial assemblies. The mission of the workshop is to understand the community views on current research frontiers, and to identify gaps and new focus areas. The workshop will advance knowledge and understanding of collective properties in nanomaterial assemblies, as well as discuss best practices and methodologies for probing the structural, morphological, and chemical properties at the nanoscale. The workshop will devise a community-driven roadmap for instrumentation, infrastructure, guidelines for future interfaces with AI, and reproducibly in data and software. By setting standards for data and reproducibility, the workshop will contribute to the development of more efficient research methodologies. This will have far-reaching implications for the ability to translate the success of applied materials into various sectors, including electronics, healthcare, and energy, where nanomaterials are increasingly being employed. <br/><br/>The workshop aims to bring together communities from different disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration that is essential for tackling complex scientific challenges. The creation of a collaborative environment will not only accelerate the pace of discovery but also facilitate the training and mentorship of the next generation of scientists and engineers. This will help align research efforts with societal needs and ensure that the advancements in nanomaterial assemblies contribute positively toward economic development, environmental sustainability, and public health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research and development (R&D) project will embark on a comprehensive conceptual replication and adaption effort to examine the degree to which prior knowledge, in the form of pre-class adaptive learning platform (APL) lessons/learning modules, is associated with student affective and cognitive outcomes in blended active learning classrooms.   In a blended active learning classroom, students are expected to prepare before class, for example, by reviewing prior knowledge using videos and online assessments.  Five engineering core courses taught at the sophomore and junior levels will serve as classroom settings for testing adaptive learning.  This testing will be done by comparing ""one-size-fits-all"" pre-class activities delivered via the Learning Management System (LMS) with adaptive and flexible pre-class lessons delivered via an adaptive learning platform (ALP).  Courses include Statistical Testing and Regression, Linear Circuits and Systems, Fluid Systems, Engineering Fluid Mechanics, and Computational Methods.  A set of published assessments, including concept inventories, will be administered to compare students' cognitive and affective outcomes in the LMS and ALP environments. <br/><br/>This R&D project will be used to (1) develop, improve, and deploy ALP lessons as well as the comparative LMS content in addition to in-class and post-class exercises for five courses at three institutions; (2) compare cognitive outcomes (i.e., conceptual, procedural, and higher-order problem-solving) and affective outcomes (cognitive engagement and academic motivation) with adaptive learning (experimental) vs. without adaptive learning (control) for blended classroom preparation; (3) analyze ALP analytics/metrics to study student learning behaviors (such as time spent on pre-class preparation, number of quiz attempts, and early completion counts) and their relationship to the outcomes; and (4) communicate findings and best practices via open educational materials, journal/conference articles, social media, websites, and faculty workshops.  The development and research effort will be conducted through a collaboration of engineering and engineering education faculty and researchers at three institutions: the University of South Florida, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Pittsburgh.  The investigation will focus on the role and association of prior knowledge (as fostered by student participation in pre-class activities and differential levels of student preparedness) with students' cognitive and affective outcomes, such as achievement, cognitive engagement, and academic motivation.  The quantitative and qualitative mixed methods study will be framed by student background factors and student demographics (e.g., GPA, gender, ethnicity, age, Pell Grant status, transfer status), existing, published, and tested assessment instruments, and theories of and approaches to adaptive learning with AI-enhanced technology (RealizeIT).  Parametric and non-parametric statistical approaches/methods and deductive and inductive approaches/framing will guide the data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

The conference brings together experts and early career researchers across mathematics and theoretical physics around a common area of interest -- how do randomly evolving interfaces behave statistically over large periods of time? Such growth is ubiquitous, for instance coming up in models of cancer or bacteria growth, liquid crystal growth, or liquid diffusion through textiles. Methods to study random growth models come from a host of different fields such as probability theory, combinatorics, integrable systems, statistical physics, random matrix theory, and stochastic partial differential equations. Thus, one of the goals of this conference is to share ideas across these different areas as well as educate early career researchers on the state-of-the-art methods. Indeed, this award's entire purpose is supporting early career researcher participation.<br/><br/>In the area of random interface growth, some models enjoy special ""integrable"" structure whereby their statistical behavior can be described through exact formulas or relations. Studying the asymptotics of these formulas and relations leads to universal predictions of the behavior of a much wider class of models, including many that are not integrable. This workshop addresses promising methods both to find and utilize integrable structures and to prove that the resulting predictions are universal. The overall class of random growth models considered here is known as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. There has been tremendous progress in recent years both on the integrability and universality front, for instance with the construction of the KPZ fixed point, directed landscape, the study of multi-species models and description of invariant measures for models with boundaries. This conference highlights these advances and inspires a new generation of researchers. https://sites.google.com/view/universalityintegrabilityinkpz<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By reducing mechanical loss and thus thermal noise in mirror coatings, the project aims to enhance the sensitivity of Cosmic Explorer (CE), the proposed third generation gravitational wave detector. This research holds significant importance as it expands our understanding of the universe by enabling observations of cosmic events, such as the collision of remnants from the first stars. Moreover, the project has broader impacts on precision measurement technology, benefiting areas like precision timing, quantum information, low noise interferometry, and the search for deviations in the gravitational inverse-square law. The outcomes of this research can also have implications for the semiconductor, laser, and quantum computing communities, as correlations between mechanical loss and other loss mechanisms are explored. Additionally, this collaboration between materials science and gravitational wave communities promotes education and diversity, providing research opportunities for students at different education levels and advancing the participation of women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop mirror coatings that meet the mechanical and optical requirements for implementation in CE. Through extending the length of the interferometer arms from the current 4 km to 20 and/or 40 km systems, CE's observational reach will be significantly expanded. To fully utilize this infrastructure, improvements are necessary in the mirror coatings' mechanical loss and thermal noise reduction. The CCR combines groups working on coating deposition, characterization of atomic structure and macroscopic material properties, and computational modeling. These components are often performed by three diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise for accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these communities focusing on a unified research goal. Since the formation of the CCR in 2017, the collaboration has become a knowledge repository for gravitational wave detector coatings research, making significant progress on all the proposed research directions, including uncovering atomic structural motifs associated with room temperature vs cryogenic mechanical losses, using that understanding to develop Ti:GeO2 coatings that can meet the requirements for Advanced LIGO + (A+). Going forward research efforts include the development of improved amorphous coatings and crystalline AlGaAs coatings. The project will investigate atomic structural motifs associated with mechanical losses at different temperatures, aiming for at least a two-fold reduction in thermal noise compared to Advanced LIGO + coatings. CCR contributions have implications for precision measurement, impacting various fields and potentially benefiting the semiconductor, laser, and quantum computing communities. Overall, this research advances the field of gravitational wave detection, supports education at multiple levels, and promotes diversity within the physical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Food security continues to escalate as a global crisis, especially for healthy whole foods. The proposed technology impacts both wild salmon (affecting both commercial and subsistence economies) and farmed salmon by offering tools for wild salmon restoration and advanced economic/environmentally sound aquaculture practices in salmon farms, eliminating toxic chemical use and dramatically less freshwater use. This project brings a new, self-contained, portable, full-recirculation incubation system to rear salmon eggs to the emergent fry stage of salmon development without the use of toxic chemicals and decreasing the amount of freshwater used from millions to hundreds of gallons. Further, the societal value of community involvement (STEM) in reversing extinction trends in wild salmon is immeasurable.<br/><br/>Wild salmon requires embryonic development with water from their natal stream. Hence, it is now recognized that the conventional central multi-million-dollar hatchery facilities are no longer suitable as they cannot accomplish this. This SBIR Phase 1 project intends to develop an incubation technology that will preserve genetic integrity, use water from the wild salmon?s native watershed, eliminate toxic chemical use, afford the ability to track restoration progress and avoid million-dollar hatchery capital costs. It will create a new salmon egg/alevin incubator by re-engineering and combining two proven salmon incubation systems together in a compact portable size. Among other features, the system will be designed for tight temperature control, having almost no vibration, and the ability to withstand major earthquakes. The system is expected to increase the survival of young fry several-fold; using water from their indigenous source, otolith mark them with a natural mark and restock the fry back into their wild stream of origin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project also includes support for workshops in which US scientists will use the latest CPR data to understand the current state of the plankton community and its implications for the health of our oceans.<br/><br/>The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey, operational since 1958, utilizes a mechanical sampler towed by commercial ships, which is more cost effective than collecting plankton at similar spatial and temporal scales using research vessels. Samples are assessed microscopically using common standards, making the resulting data sets unique for addressing questions about long-term variability and change in ocean plankton communities. This project is continuing support for sampling in the western Atlantic from Iceland to the eastern margin of the USA. The route passes through the climate-sensitive and highly-productive subpolar gyre region, where the state of plankton communities has broad implications for fisheries and carbon sequestration in the wider North Atlantic. In addition, the investigator is forming a working group of scientists who will use data from the CPR survey to develop and pursue major research themes, as well as implement a series of additional workshops to expand CPR data utilization among the US scientific community. Topics of interest include: examining timescales of change in plankton community diversity and structure, how connected these changes are to the wider ocean, and how change in plankton communities impact ecosystem function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology and its commercialized products will benefit (1) resource-limited areas to conduct more nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) to control the spread of infectious diseases; (2) life science researchers who routinely perform NAATs in universities, government institutes, and industrial settings; (3) laboratory workers that constantly monitor nuclease and protease activities in the environment; (4) analytical chemists who provide services to analyze biological or chemical samples; and (5) pharmaceutical companies that typically rely on the expensive molecular probes for drug discovery. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of highly fluorescent silver nanocluster reporters that can transform from one cluster size (e.g., Ag13) to another (Ag10). When this transformation takes place, the silver cluster changes its emission color. This change of color can be employed as an indicator for many biological and chemical assays that rely on fluorescence for detection. Noble metal nanoclusters can be called quantum dots since they share a size-tunable fluorescence emission property with semiconductor quantum dots. Due to their strong quantum confinement effect, adding or removing one atom to or from a noble metal nanocluster can significantly change the structure of the cluster, thus altering its electronic and optical properties. Recently, a silver nanocluster probe was discovered that shows a clear green-to-red color conversion upon DNA host fragmentation by a nuclease.

While many types of malware detectors exist, this project focuses on improving those that identify malware without actually running it.  In these types of detectors, an ML model is trained on many examples of malware and of benign software to learn how to classify new examples based on patterns in the computer instructions they contain. A specific threat to the use of such ML models is that attackers might use their understanding of a model's workings to develop malware variants that are particularly hard for the model to detect.  This project seeks to develop ML models for malware detection that are reliable despite attackers' attempts to fool them, as well developing models that are more time- and space-efficient.<br/><br/>The technical innovations of this project lie in basic research on techniques to quantifiably improve the resistance of malware detectors to being fooled, with greater efficiency than has been possible to date.  These techniques include new approaches to combining multiple classifiers into ensembles; novel model architectures; leveraging methods that attribute classification outcomes to specific properties of the input; and improvements to ML training methods for the malware domain.  This project will develop principles underlying the application of these techniques to improve ML models and empirically demonstrate the improvements they yield, using datasets of malware and benign executables.  Where doing so is responsible (i.e., does not risk facilitating new attacks on operational systems), the advances of this project will be open-sourced for others to leverage in follow-on research; in other cases, the implementations will be distributed only by request to parties who are verifiable researchers or developers of anti-malware tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The detection of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes in 2015 launched the field of gravitational wave astronomy. Gravitational-wave detectors with a two-fold increase in sensitivity over Advanced LIGO would yield an order of magnitude increase in detection rate for black hole coalescences, and enable detection of fainter objects like binary neutron stars, greatly increasing their value for multi-messenger astronomy. All future detector upgrades and concepts rely on the development of new mirror coating materials to reduce thermal noise, which is the core research focus this collaborative project between Martin Fejer's group at Stanford University and Hai-Ping Cheng's group at the University of Florida. Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical loss in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with the mechanical and optical requirements for implementation in future generations of LIGO. Meeting this goal for room temperature detectors requires a solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: understanding the nature of and finding means to reduce the low-energy excitations in amorphous metal oxides. On a longer time-scale, the proposed 3G detectors' cryogenic operation broadens the possible choice of low-noise mirror materials to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors.<br/><br/>The mid-band sensitivity of the Advanced LIGO detectors is limited by thermal noise resulting from mechanical loss in the mirror coatings, and future upgrades including Advanced LIGO Plus will seek to reduce this source of noise by a factor of two or more. The Stanford-Florida partnership, alongside collaborators in the LSC Center for Coatings Research (CCR), has identified different structural motifs associated with room-temperature vs cryogenic mechanical losses, which led to synthesis of germania (GeO2) films, giving rise to the lowest-loss amorphous oxide film other than silica. Going forward, this structural guide, based on electron and x-ray scattering atomic structure data, will serve as a paradigm informing the development of high-refractive-index amorphous coatings with lower elastic loss. Atomic modeling of coating elastic loss combined with simulations of the coating deposition process will provide guidance for the selection of candidate materials, assist in interpretation of experimental structure data, and will ultimately assist in the design of synthesis experiments. Another long-standing effort at Stanford has been measurements of the absorption of low-optical-loss materials at the sub-ppm/cm level, dating back to the down select between silica and sapphire for initial LIGO test masses. The groups will continue to use the interferometric tool developed for those studies to characterize cryogenic losses in single-crystal silicon samples to evaluate their suitability for implementation in the Voyager technology demonstrator and future cryogenic detectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike transmission system state estimation which has been extensively developed, distribution system state estimation and topology identification remain open research questions due to the complexity of heterogeneous uncertainties, frequent changes in network topology, and limited real-time measurements. Therefore, many approaches developed for transmission systems are unsuitable for distribution systems.

This complex mixture plays key roles within aquatic ecosystems. DOM is a source of nutrients and food for microbes. It acts as a sunscreen in surface waters by reducing ultraviolet radiation. It can also bind trace metals, changing their bioavailability and toxicity. The chemical structure of DOM determines both its ecological roles and its environmental fate. Microbial uptake and respiration and degradation by sunlight are key processes that transform DOM, leading to its eventual oxidation to carbon dioxide. Another key factor in DOM fate is the presence of salt. Salt ions can react with sunlight; the resulting products can alter DOM structures. This project will investigate the role of salt in photochemical reactions. Experiments will be done where salt and sunlight will be added to freshwater samples with high concentrations of brown, land-derived DOM and freshwater samples with relatively clear lake-derived DOM. The study will measure DOM loss and changes in DOM chemical structure. These results will be compared with studies of the original freshwater and samples collected along a river to marine transect. Many inland waters are becoming saltier due to land use changes, road salt use, and climate change. Many coastal waters are undergoing high variability in salt levels due to major storm events like hurricanes. Results from this study will help predict DOM effects on algal growth, trace metal binding, energy for food webs, and interactions with man-made chemicals.  This project will provide training opportunities for students; results will be shared with both the scientific community and the public.<br/><br/>DOM in aquatic systems plays key environmental roles. These roles are largely a function of DOM chemical structure, with carboxyl groups in DOM being important in energy transfer in biota, trace metal chelation, and interactions with organic pollutants. The effects of salinity on photochemical changes to DOM structure, including carboxylation and decarboxylation, are, however, surprisingly unconstrained. These salinity effects are important to address now, as climate change is altering the salinity of inland and coastal marine systems. We will investigate DOM photochemistry using a freshwater transect (St. Louis River to Lake Superior) that includes sites varying in DOM source (land plants vs phytoplankton) and structure (more aromatic vs more aliphatic). These samples can be amended with salts of various concentrations and major ion compositions. Thus we can tease apart the roles of ionic strength (how much salt) from the specific effects of halide radical formation (what kinds of salts are present). We will compare these experimental results with photochemical studies on a natural freshwater to saltwater transect (Penobscot River to Gulf of Maine) at a similar latitude and with similar upstream land use patterns. Understanding salinity?s effects on DOM photochemical transformations will be a key step in predicting the effects of climate change on DOM?s environmental roles in aquatic systems. This project includes training opportunities for two graduate students and four undergraduate students. Project results will be shared through presentations and peer-reviewed publications and via Science on Deck research vessel tours and the Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such applications are revolutionizing innumerable fields, with a projected market volume of $10.3 Billion in 2024 in the U.S. Yet, in reality the potential of VR/AR/XR remains untapped due to a remarkable limitation of existing video streaming solutions: high-quality videos entail huge latencies of 30-50 seconds, while low latency is only achieved with low quality video. However, both are important factors in VR/AR/XR, since high video quality is essential to generate a truly immersive experience for users, and low latency is essential to allow for live virtual interaction. The proposed technology promises to overcome this problem and unleash the full potential of VR/AR/XR, through advanced applications in education, business, healthcare, defense, leisure, and more. This proprietary technology is the result of years of R&D, making it difficult for competitors to match its superior performance. If successful, this technology will represent a key commercial milestone for the proposing company, with forecasted annual revenues of $74.5 million by year three of commercialization, through a business model based on pay-per-use fees. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to develop a video streaming solution that can manage 360 videos with ultra-high quality (>8K at a minimum of 60 fps) at low latencies (<1 second), enabling seamlessly switching between multiple cameras and audio tracks.

This complex mixture plays key roles within aquatic ecosystems. DOM is a source of nutrients and food for microbes. It acts as a sunscreen in surface waters by reducing ultraviolet radiation. It can also bind trace metals, changing their bioavailability and toxicity. The chemical structure of DOM determines both its ecological roles and its environmental fate. Microbial uptake and respiration and degradation by sunlight are key processes that transform DOM, leading to its eventual oxidation to carbon dioxide. Another key factor in DOM fate is the presence of salt. Salt ions can react with sunlight; the resulting products can alter DOM structures. This project will investigate the role of salt in photochemical reactions. Experiments will be done where salt and sunlight will be added to freshwater samples with high concentrations of brown, land-derived DOM and freshwater samples with relatively clear lake-derived DOM. The study will measure DOM loss and changes in DOM chemical structure. These results will be compared with studies of the original freshwater and samples collected along a river to marine transect. Many inland waters are becoming saltier due to land use changes, road salt use, and climate change. Many coastal waters are undergoing high variability in salt levels due to major storm events like hurricanes. Results from this study will help predict DOM effects on algal growth, trace metal binding, energy for food webs, and interactions with man-made chemicals. This project will provide training opportunities for students; results will be shared with both the scientific community and the public.<br/><br/>DOM in aquatic systems plays key environmental roles. These roles are largely a function of DOM chemical structure, with carboxyl groups in DOM being important in energy transfer in biota, trace metal chelation, and interactions with organic pollutants. The effects of salinity on photochemical changes to DOM structure, including carboxylation and decarboxylation, are, however, surprisingly unconstrained. These salinity effects are important to address now, as climate change is altering the salinity of inland and coastal marine systems. We will investigate DOM photochemistry using a freshwater transect (St. Louis River to Lake Superior) that includes sites varying in DOM source (land plants vs phytoplankton) and structure (more aromatic vs more aliphatic). These samples can be amended with salts of various concentrations and major ion compositions. Thus we can tease apart the roles of ionic strength (how much salt) from the specific effects of halide radical formation (what kinds of salts are present). We will compare these experimental results with photochemical studies on a natural freshwater to saltwater transect (Penobscot River to Gulf of Maine) at a similar latitude and with similar upstream land use patterns. Understanding salinity?s effects on DOM photochemical transformations will be a key step in predicting the effects of climate change on DOM?s environmental roles in aquatic systems. This project includes training opportunities for two graduate students and four undergraduate students. Project results will be shared through presentations and peer-reviewed publications and via Science on Deck research vessel tours and the Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long term goal of this project is to generate a predictive theoretical framework that relates chemical structure to reactivity in the excited state for heterolytic bond scission. Heterolytic bond cleavage represents one of the two possible ways in which a chemical bond can break, with both of the two electrons in the bond being given to one of the atoms in the bond.  This work is focused on studying how this bond breaking can occur when a molecule is irradiated.  Photoheterolysis reactions are important in biological, materials, and environmental chemistry applications. Understanding the mechanistic principles for a simple archetypal bond-breaking photoreaction will contribute to the broader problem of understanding the guiding mechanistic principles that direct photochemical reactions.  Professor Winter will also be involved with a Freshman Research Initiative that involves first-year college students in an early multidisciplinary research experience. He will continue to recruit undergraduates and students from underrepresented groups into his lab. <br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Winter and his team seek to advance from static computations of excited state barriers and conical intersections and move toward dynamic excited state trajectories. Non-adiabatic trajectories begin from the initial light absorption event, evolve on the excited state surface, and hop to the ground state ion pair photoproduct. These simulations and experiments will answer key questions, including: (i) Are photoheterolysis reactions governed by transition state control or by the presence of productive conical intersections (CI?s) near the ion pair; (ii) Does the Hammond postulate apply for S1 and T1 as it does for thermal (S0) SN1 reactions? (iii) How does the topography of the CI and the CI seam influence the branching ratios of photoheterolysis reactions at funnels? (iv) How important is the minimum energy crossing point, and the surrounding topology, of the CI for understanding the mechanisms of non-adiabatic surface crossings? (iv) How does spin state and solvent alter the mechanism?  High level, excited state trajectory simulations in combination with ultrafast laser flash photolysis experiments will jointly provide a powerful approach for answering these fascinating questions of broad photochemical relevance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current techniques utilize RNA sequencing or microscopy. However, these methods lack single cell resolution of RNA transcripts and/or unbiased transcript detection.  The proposed technology addresses these deficiencies by developing a spatial single cell sequencing assay that generates next generation sequencing (NGS) libraries without the need for a complex instrument. This reduces the time required to process a single tissue section as compared with imaging-based platforms.  This technology may provide a new tool to assist scientists in the study of the role of cellular organization and communication in medical research and therapeutic development.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the proposed technology. It is based on the previous development of a spatial sequencing assay.  In this assay, called the XYZeq assay, tissue slices are deposited on top of microwell arrays. Each well in the array contains a unique spatial label that encodes each cell with a unique sequence that encodes their initial spatial location. After dissociation, single cells are extracted from the array and processed for single cell sequencing using next generation sequencing (NGS). This method is an unbiased sequencing assay that can detect any transcript and generates single cell sequencing data.  In addition, the assay is not restricted by pre-designed panels and generates additional information such as cell genotype, presence of mutations, and potentially immune repertoire information.  With a focus on localizing cells and easy integration with existing single-cell NGS workflows, high-quality, multi-modal data (including RNA and protein profiles and chromatin accessibility) are generated while providing cell locations for the same cells in a single assay, enabling the research community to utilize spatial genomics to its full potential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is because most renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are intermittent, requiring storage during times of high production to ensure availability during times of low production. Hydrogen is an excellent medium for storage, but very large volumes will be required. Surface facilities and underground salt caverns provide some capacity, but not enough for what is needed. Deep geologic formations comprised of porous rocks are a promising solution because they offer large capacity with demonstrated success in storing other fluids (e.g., carbon dioxide). What is not well understood is how much of the hydrogen injected during summertime can be recovered during winter and how hydrogen purity is impacted by the presence of a co-injected fluid, called cushion gas. The seasonal injection-withdrawal cycles will likely generate and trap many hydrogen and cushion-gas bubbles in the rock that subsequently exchange mass with each other through a process known as Ostwald ripening. Both can contribute to the loss and purity degradation of hydrogen. This award aims to understand the basic mechanisms controlling entrapment and ripening of multicomponent bubbles relevant to hydrogen storage. This understanding will help select suitable geologic storage sites and compatible cushion-gasses.<br/><br/>Hydrogen is widely regarded as a key pillar for decarbonizing the global energy system. To buffer the intermittency burden of wind and solar at scale, vast quantities of hydrogen must be stored seasonally. Existing solutions (e.g., tanks and salt caverns) do not provide nearly enough capacity for what is needed. Geologic hydrogen storage in deep formations meets the demand, but very little is understood about how hydrogen interacts with pre-existing and co-injected fluids, called cushion gas. The goal of this award is to understand how cyclically injected multicomponent gases become trapped within a porous microstructure and how they evolve through diffusive mass exchange, or Ostwald ripening. An integrated experimental and modeling plan is proposed to gain fundamental insights into: (1) the factors that control the spatial distribution of trapped bubbles during cyclic injections and withdrawals; (2) how bubble sizes, shapes, and compositions evolve due to ripening; and (3) how collective bubble equilibration impacts the macroscopic storage capacity and flow resistance of the porous medium.

This broad generic treatment also results in non-responsiveness and adverse effects for individual patients/patient groups. Current biomarkers are primarily based on output from less than 3% of the human genome, with the remainder being considered dark matter - untapped genomic sequences that provide a vast resource of patient-specific information.

Biomarkers are typically developed from proteins involved in or associated with disease processes. These proteins are produced from a very small proportion of human genomic sequence. This means that a vast portion of the human genome, considered dark matter, remains untapped from a biomedical and biotechnological perspective. Using underutilized sequences identified by computational approaches, the goal is to increase the number of candidates entering the biomarker development pipeline, and significantly expand the biomarker candidate pool. This expansion may support precision medicine approaches through the identification and development patient-specific biomarkers and disease-specific therapies.

A specific threat to the use of such ML models is that attackers might use their understanding of a model's workings to develop malware variants that are particularly hard for the model to detect.  This project seeks to develop ML models for malware detection that are reliable despite attackers' attempts to fool them, as well developing models that are more time- and space-efficient.<br/><br/>The technical innovations of this project lie in basic research on techniques to quantifiably improve the resistance of malware detectors to being fooled, with greater efficiency than has been possible to date.  These techniques include new approaches to combining multiple classifiers into ensembles; novel model architectures; leveraging methods that attribute classification outcomes to specific properties of the input; and improvements to ML training methods for the malware domain.  This project will develop principles underlying the application of these techniques to improve ML models and empirically demonstrate the improvements they yield, using datasets of malware and benign executables.

The science objectives of this project are: (1) to characterize the evolution of compressible fluctuations with radial distance and in different types of turbulent solar wind; (2) to determine what phase-space dynamics leads to proton heating and to quantify the heating rate in different types of turbulence (balanced vs. imbalanced); (3) to incorporate kinetic compressible effects into a global wave-driven solar wind model. To achieve our science objectives, we will (1) analyze the radial evolution of fluctuations from Parker Solar Probe, Helios, and Wind data, (2) perform hybrid-PIC numerical simulations and (3) develop a novel global solar wind model based on knowledge-based machine learning methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the DIW printing process, multi-phase ink, which combines solid-, liquid-, and gas-phase ingredients, introduces complex fluid dynamics to allow for the fabrication of parts with enhanced properties. Potential applications include electronics, aerospace, and biotechnology. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award supports a comprehensive research effort to link the DIW process parameters with ink property. If successful, the project will provide new understanding of the rheological behavior of multi-phase inks used for extrusion-based 3D printing in general. The impact will extend beyond the research outcomes and empower valuable education for graduate, undergraduate, and underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The outreach activities will promote broader participation and inspire students to pursue careers in advanced manufacturing. <br/><br/>This research project aims to unravel the shear-thinning flow mechanism of multi-phase inks in the DIW process. The current understanding of multi-phase ink primarily relies on macroscopic rheological properties, resulting in a gap between macroscopic understanding and microscopic fluid dynamics. The effort seeks to fill in this gap by discovering the fundamental knowledge of the interaction between ink shear-thinning rheological properties and DIW processing parameters via three research tasks. Task 1 focuses on establishing and implementing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation for multi-phase inks. Task 2 uses the established model to evaluate rheology properties. A key research question to be addressed is how to accurately simulate the interactions among various ink components and predict rheological properties. Task 3 develops In-situ sensing for experimental verification. Simulation models will be validated using in-situ sensing and post-manufacturing characterization. The fluid dynamics data, including the flow trajectory, ink velocity, and shear rate, will be collected using a particle imaging velocimetry (PIV)-based setup. The comparison between CFD simulations and experiments could provide new insights into process control. The new knowledge to be discovered from this research will facilitate broader adoption of the DIW technology and impact the other fields of engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the first and central topics in the research of number theory is to study the distribution of prime numbers. In 1853, Chebyshev observed that there seems to be more primes taking the form of a multiple of four plus three than a multiple of four plus one. This phenomenon is now referred to as Chebyshev's bias and its study led to a new branch of number theory, comparative prime number theory. As a subfield of analytic number theory, research in this area focuses on examining how prime counting functions and other arithmetic functions compare to one another. This field has witnessed significant growth and activity in the last three decades, especially after the publication of the influential article on Chebyshev's bias by Rubinstein and Sarnak in 1994.  The primary goal of this award will be to provide participant support and fund US-based early career researchers to attend this unique event, giving them the opportunity to discuss new ideas, advance research projects, and interact with established researchers.<br/><br/>The symposium will bring together many leading and early-career researchers with expertise and interest in comparative prime number theory to present and discuss various aspects of current research in the field, with special emphasis on results pertaining to the distribution of counting functions in number theory and zeros of L-functions, consequences of quantitative Linear Independence, oscillations of the Mertens sum, and the frequency of sign changes. Through this symposium, we will advertise the recently disseminated survey ""An Annotated Bibliography for Comparative Prime Number Theory"" by Martin et al which aims to record every publication within the topic of comparative prime number theory, together with a summary of results, and presenting a unified system of notation and terminology for referring to the quantities and hypotheses that are the main objects of study. Another important outcome of the symposium will be compiling and publicizing a problem list, with the hope of stimulating future research and providing young researchers with potential projects.

The structural scaffold of a blood clot is a mesh of fibers, composed of a biomaterial called fibrin. These fibers trap blood cells and other blood components during the clotting process. When wound healing is complete, the fibers must be digested by enzymes in the blood in order to prevent significant risks from a blocked blood vessel such as strokes and heart attacks. During the digestion process, flowing blood and blood cells subject the fibers to significant tension. However, it is not well understood how these forces on fibrin impact the digestion process. The aim of this research is to test several hypotheses about how tension could regulate the breakdown of blood clots. Results from this research will yield a deeper understanding of the causes that lead to increased risk of strokes and/or heart attacks due to improper blood clot digestion, providing avenues for improved national health. In addition, studying the blood clotting and breakdown processes involves collaborative research in biochemistry, medicine, engineering, mathematics, and physics, thus providing a robust training atmosphere for student researchers. This project will support a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate researchers at three different institutions, providing them with a multidisciplinary training environment. Moreover, the lead investigators will develop curricular materials to teach principles about tension and blood clot digestion to elementary school students using LEGO during a 1-week STEM summer camp.  <br/><br/>During blood clot formation, fibrin polymerizes into a 3-dimensional gel wherein the fibers have inherent tension. After polymerization, clots are subject to applied tension, which originates from numerous sources including platelet contraction and blood hemodynamics. The fibrin network must withstand vascular forces during wound healing but then, to avoid blood vessel occlusion, must be dissolved through a process called fibrinolysis. A key knowledge gap lies in understanding the extent to which, and the mechanisms by which, inherent and applied tension regulate the fibrinolytic process. This project extends initial findings that inherent tension accelerates lysis while applied tension hinders lysis to perform the first multiscale study correlating amounts of fiber and clot tension with fibrinolytic rates. Each aim of this project centers on testing one hypothesized mechanism of how tension affects lysis: 1) causing structural rearrangements in the gel prior to lysis, shrinking the volume and expelling lytic enzymes; 2) altering the binding kinetics of enzymes to fibrin; and 3) causing structural rearrangements within the fibers and network structure during lysis, thereby clearing the fibrin more rapidly from the clot volume. Each hypothesis will be tested using a multidisciplinary research approach across three different institutions involving tensile testing, time-resolved microscopy, and mathematical modeling. This work will result in a combinatorial multiscale mathematical and experimental model that can predict lytic outcomes as a function of mechanical forces. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is desirable to minimize the negative consequences associated with power systems undergoing these extreme events, while maintaining system objectives/targets during normal operating times. However, standard mathematical tools and computational methods cannot be applied in such scenarios with acceptable guarantees of accuracy and robustness. Motivated by this, the PIs seek to develop a novel theoretical and numerical toolkit with the following broad aims in mind: (i) it is suitable for analysis, design, control, and optimization of dynamic systems that exhibit irregular behavior such as but not limited to modern power systems; and (ii) it is accurate, robust, and user-friendly. The developed tools will be tested through application to modern wind turbine power systems, with goals of maximizing power generation and minimizing extreme behavior effects for the power delivered to the grid. Additional broader impacts of this multidisciplinary research include its usefulness/relevance to many fields of systems control and its overlap with issues in emerging technological and implementation challenges found in green energy, sustainability, and global warming. Moreover, this project will train graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented populations, in STEM fields.<br/> <br/> <br/>Recent advances in generalized derivatives theory now allow for a computationally-relevant sensitivity theory for nonsmooth modeling frameworks, including nonsmooth ordinary-differential equations (ODEs) and differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). This sensitivity theory is practically implementable and provides first-order generalized derivative information that may be supplied to dedicated numerical methods with guaranteed convergence rates. Moreover, it allows for the development of tools for system analysis, control, and optimization. Other approaches, such as smoothing approximations, necessarily introduce user-defined parameters and numerical error and do not typically come with guarantees of recovering the true behavior of the system in the limit. Since nonsmooth ODEs and DAEs are an appropriate modeling framework for many systems, such as but not limited to modern wind turbine power systems (WTPSs), that exhibit nonsmoothness due to uncontrollable conditions and/or transitions between operating conditions, this nonsmooth ODE and DAE theory is relevant to this project, which has three broad goals: First, the PIs aim to develop a dynamic sensitivity theory for nonsmooth/discontinuous ODE and DAE systems that is computationally relevant and applicable to a wide class of systems. This includes extending existing smooth sensitivity-based dynamic and control system analysis methods to the nonsmooth and/or discontinuous setting. Second, they seek to extend the theory and application of control theory and methods for a wide class of nonsmooth and/or discontinuous ODE and DAE systems. Third, the project apply the developed theory and tools to improve the analysis and control capabilities of WTPSs, in order to increase the resilience of WTPSs, which are quite different from traditional power systems, and the power grid. That is, the application goal will be minimizing, or suppressing, negative consequences resulting from WTPSs exposed to extreme situations and maintaining system objectives/targets desirable in normal times as much as possible (i.e., with the least possible disruption due to extreme events).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its mission is to perform pre-competitive, industry-oriented research to additively manufacture heterogeneous products with diverse functionality via integration of novel materials across all material classes, complex structures, and cutting-edge processes. SHAP3D?s industrial partners represent all sectors of the additive manufacturing (AM) supply chain, including materials, machines and processes, designers, and end users in commercial sectors such as aerospace, defense, and consumer products. SHAP3D will tackle real-world problems and help educate the future workforce. The SHAP3D Center will advance fundamental understanding and create economic value for industry by: (a) enabling the rational design, creation, and use of new materials, geometries, processes, and performance associated with additively manufactured products; (b) generating this knowledge through close collaboration between university and industry/government partners; (c) establishing a synergistic network of excellence in AM knowledge, experience, and facilities of added value to each partner; and (d) training students as the next generation of industry leaders in AM.  The Arizona State University (ASU) site will contribute its expertise in sustainable materials design for end-of-life, multi-material and multi-modality printing of polymers, materials synthesis with a focus on engineering polymers, and polymer characterization tools for additive manufacturing including rheology, mechanical, and thermal analyses.<br/><br/>SHAP3D will perform essential research providing the fundamental knowledge for heterogeneous AM that integrates multiple engineering materials to enhance structure and functionality. SHAP3D will develop critical insight into the structure-processing-property relationships to predict, control, and create new materials and processes for heterogeneous 3D printing. The vision is to provide industrial participants with new, validated capabilities with tunable properties and superior functionality for use in real-world designs. The Center?s research activities aim to accelerate expansion and competitiveness of the domestic AM industry and its customers by addressing two critical market needs: (1) the growth of AM into more complex topologies, heterogeneous materials, and multi-functional applications commanding high margins commensurate with increased performance; and (2) the expansion of AM into lower margin industries via order-of-magnitude improvements in throughput, material-per-performance cost reductions, and ease-of-use and design rules. Industry members view these market needs from three economic drivers: (1) design concepts for integrating dissimilar materials into heterogeneous products for multi-functional components/products enabling new products and industries, (2) reduction in processing costs via optimized and parallel processes to additively manufacture products more quickly with higher resolution, and (3) use of complex geometries, high performance materials, and improved quality enabling  diverse and lighter weight products to minimize total life cycle costs and environmental footprint.  The key areas of the research strategy are: (1) the ability to print heterogenous parts using mixed printing techniques, (2) printing multiple materials by designing and structuring interfaces, (3) prediction of properties and the processes that will produce those properties, (4) enabling greater functionality, complexity and the ability to make things that cannot otherwise be made, and (4) improving sustainability and recyclability through AM. The ASU site will leverage shared facilities, which includes lithographic, extrusion (FFF combined with filament extrusion), and UV-assisted direct ink write printing platforms together with scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, melt and solution rheology, dynamic mechanical analysis, tensile testing, thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, computational modeling, and chromatographic analysis (high-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC, and size exclusion chromatography, SEC).

Due to the limitation of computation resources, it is hard to numerically resolve all-size vortices. Scientists have found that small-scale vortices have similarities although large-scale vortices are quite different. Large eddy simulation only resolves large-scale vortices and leaves sub-grid scales for modeling. Therefore, the accuracy of large eddy simulations is determined by the sub-grid models. The concept of eddy viscosity is still adopted in most practical turbulent flow simulations. However, most of the existing sub-grid models still use the resolved shear to calculate the eddy viscosity, which is inconsistent with the physics, especially in the shear-dominated regions like the laminar sublayer in turbulent boundary layers, where vorticity/shear is large, but eddy viscosity is zero. The inconsistency is caused by the misunderstanding that vortex strength is measured by vorticity. The remedy of using a wall function or artificial adjustment near the wall region cannot solve the consistency problem. Liutex is a new physical quantity exactly representing the direction and strength of a vortex or eddy. Previous direct numerical simulation has shown that Liutex has similarity in the dissipation subregion of the turbulent boundary layer, which paves the foundation for constructing a new sub-grid model by using Liutex.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a reliable and efficient Liutex-based sub-grid model for the large eddy simulation community. Liutex is a rigorous mathematical definition of vortex that correctly distinguishes fluid rotation and shear. The introduction of Liutex to extract the rigid rotation from the fluid velocity gradient is groundbreaking work in turbulence research. So, modeling small-scale vortices using Liutex instead of shear is very reasonable as eddy is vortex and vortex is Liutex. This project plans to (1) develop a new Liutex-based sub-grid model, (2) develop a new dynamic Liutex-based sub-grid model, (3) test new models in a variety of computational fluid dynamics cases such as backward step flow, S-duct flow, and flow around an airfoil, (4) evaluate the effect of new Liutex-based sub-grid model and compare it with other existing sub-grid models. The code of the new model will be provided to the community through GitHub. As large eddy simulation becomes one of the major tools of computational fluid dynamics, a breakthrough in the development of the sub-grid models will benefit almost all fluid-related research areas and engineering applications in multi-disciplinary research areas including aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, meteorology (hurricanes and tornadoes for example), bio-flow (blood flow and respiratory flow for example), astronomy (sun storm for example), etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This new understanding will result in better predictions of ice formation at the coastline, which varies significantly in space and time. The project will use observations obtained from instruments deployed on the seafloor and from ships to watch how freeze-up occurs over a section of the coastal Alaskan Arctic. We will introduce new ways of making measurements in the Arctic, that are both cheaper and better-adapted to the harsh environment, which can be incorporated into future work. These observations will be compared with seasonal and prior datasets to understand how the freeze-up may vary in different years.

The proposed work will address fundamental feedbacks and connections of physical processes on the Alaskan Arctic shelf during fall freeze-up. This new understanding will enable better predictions of seasonal and decadal changes in landfast ice formation, which has a high amount of variability on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Analysis will also improve our understanding of the sediment pathways during the stormy fall period. The field experiment will use moorings, autonomous systems, and seafloor cables to capture the spatial and temporal variability in freeze-up processes over a region on the Alaskan Beaufort shelf. The research will take a nested approach, utilizing seasonal observations and pre-existing inter-annual time series to capture the roles of offshore forcing, local hydrodynamic processes, and air-sea exchange. Measurements will be made using novel integration of multiple new low-cost telemetered sensors, amphibious drones, seafloor cables, and Arctic-hardened moorings, building capacity for future autonomous observing and monitoring systems adapted for the coastal Arctic. Outreach efforts during the project will engage regional high school students, as well as students who have never experienced the Arctic. We will continue building on a ?Coastal Oceanography? unit developed over the past four years for high schoolers in an Alaskan Arctic village, expanded to include the middle school, and incorporating virtual lessons with annual in-person activities to deploy small student-built instruments. Additionally, we will establish ongoing engagement with middle school science classes in three locations with in-person visits prior to the fieldwork, live-stream events during the cruise, and follow-up visits afterwards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed activity seeks to conduct research and development (R&D) to demonstrate technical feasibility of continuous power generation from the quantum field for terrestrial and space applications. The research activity will advance knowledge and understanding of quantum field theory and the nature of the quantum vacuum for the purpose of power generation and commercialization. This is expected to enable a continuous baseload renewable type power source in environments where other renewables are often not readily present.  In so doing, the research will also enable new pathways for novel forms of radiation generation and detection, thereby enhancing space sensing and providing new communication capabilities making use of novel forms of radiation.  This product may also benefit from high throughput scalable in-space manufacturing advances going forward, and serve as a reliable, light weight and abundant power source for the acceleration and growth of the large scale in-space economy.

With this enhancement, the custom Casimir cavity structure establishes an electrostatic potential between the pillars along the midplane and the cavity walls. The goals and scope of the research are: prediction of tunneling current magnitude for given metal-insulator-metal combination; and optimal selection of combinations of materials and insulator thicknesses. The methods to accomplish validation of software analysis tools are as follows: fabricate numerous metal-insulator-metal samples; conduct laboratory tests to quantify tunneling current performance; update analysis tools with measured performance data.

It is desirable to minimize the negative consequences associated with power systems undergoing these extreme events, while maintaining system objectives/targets during normal operating times. However, standard mathematical tools and computational methods cannot be applied in such scenarios with acceptable guarantees of accuracy and robustness. Motivated by this, the PIs seek to develop a novel theoretical and numerical toolkit with the following broad aims in mind: (i) it is suitable for analysis, design, control, and optimization of dynamic systems that exhibit irregular behavior such as but not limited to modern power systems; and (ii) it is accurate, robust, and user-friendly. The developed tools will be tested through application to modern wind turbine power systems, with goals of maximizing power generation and minimizing extreme behavior effects for the power delivered to the grid. Additional broader impacts of this multidisciplinary research include its usefulness/relevance to many fields of systems control and its overlap with issues in emerging technological and implementation challenges found in green energy, sustainability, and global warming. Moreover, this project will aim to train graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented populations, in STEM fields.<br/> <br/> <br/>Recent advances in generalized derivatives theory now allow for a computationally-relevant sensitivity theory for nonsmooth modeling frameworks, including nonsmooth ordinary-differential equations (ODEs) and differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). This sensitivity theory is practically implementable and provides first-order generalized derivative information that may be supplied to dedicated numerical methods with guaranteed convergence rates. Moreover, it allows for the development of tools for system analysis, control, and optimization. Other approaches, such as smoothing approximations, necessarily introduce user-defined parameters and numerical error and do not typically come with guarantees of recovering the true behavior of the system in the limit. Since nonsmooth ODEs and DAEs are an appropriate modeling framework for many systems, such as but not limited to modern wind turbine power systems (WTPSs), that exhibit nonsmoothness due to uncontrollable conditions and/or transitions between operating conditions, this nonsmooth ODE and DAE theory is relevant to this project, which has three broad goals: First, the PIs aim to develop a dynamic sensitivity theory for nonsmooth/discontinuous ODE and DAE systems that is computationally relevant and applicable to a wide class of systems. This includes extending existing smooth sensitivity-based dynamic and control system analysis methods to the nonsmooth and/or discontinuous setting. Second, they seek to extend the theory and application of control theory and methods for a wide class of nonsmooth and/or discontinuous ODE and DAE systems. Third, the project apply the developed theory and tools to improve the analysis and control capabilities of WTPSs, in order to increase the resilience of WTPSs, which are quite different from traditional power systems, and the power grid. That is, the application goal will be minimizing, or suppressing, negative consequences resulting from WTPSs exposed to extreme situations and maintaining system objectives/targets desirable in normal times as much as possible (i.e., with the least possible disruption due to extreme events).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ICN is the official meeting of the International Society for Neuroethology. Neuroethology is a branch of neuroscience focused on the neural mechanisms underlying natural behavior. Research in this multidisciplinary field seeks to bridge the gap between neural mechanisms and behavior in the context of evolutionary processes. The complexity of this task necessitates combining various levels of analysis, from molecular and genetic to computational, across invertebrate and vertebrate species. By emphasizing comparisons between behavioral adaptations and neural mechanisms across species, neuroethologists can exploit natural solutions to biological problems to investigate the brain?behavior relationship. This comparative approach facilitates the identification of common brain organization principles as well as detection mechanisms that enhance behavioral performance, which can subsequently be implemented computationally or technologically. The inclusive scientific nature of neuroethology and the relatively small size of the ICN provide a unique opportunity for cross-fertilization among different research approaches that are often viewed as separate realms at large conferences. In addition, neuroethology is an ideal discipline for identifying animal models with specializations that may facilitate future scientific breakthroughs.<br/><br/>This is the first time since a highly successful meeting in 1989 that the ICN will take place in Berlin, Germany. To ensure that the ICN is successful, the Local Organizing Committee has secured the Henry Ford Building, belonging to the Freie Universita?t Berlin, which has a large lecture hall and ample additional space that is suitable for this meeting. The Program Committee, which consists of a diverse team of researchers, is committed to promoting the unique neuroethological approach and the highly interactive and diverse nature of the International Society for Neuroethology. As the major scientific meeting of this Society, the ICN provides a critical venue for international students and scientists at different professional ranks to meet informally and discuss research, theory, and techniques in neuroethology. Its comparative, interdisciplinary, and collaborative focus makes the ICN an essential scientific platform for sharing novel insights into brain function and behavior across the animal kingdom. Previous neuroethological research has been integral for fundamental discoveries in neuroscience and revolutionary technologies. The main goal of this meeting is to disseminate and discuss new scientific ideas and data in the field of neuroethology. The conference program promotes this theme through plenary sessions, symposia, poster sessions, and workshops.<br/><br/>This project is funded jointly by the Behavioral and the Neural Systems Clusters in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems of the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, existing crowdsensing solutions are mainly built on a cloud-centric approach that raises significant security and privacy challenges. For example, accurate and real-time situational awareness of flooding and wildfires is important for incident commanders and residents to fight these natural hazards, and mobile crowdsensing can provide large-scale monitoring of hazards by pictures and/or input provided by mobile users. Although most users are willing to help, they may hesitate to participate in such a crowdsensing task due to privacy concerns, as their private information including GPS locations may be leaked during the transmissions to a cloud server or from the storage on the server. This project investigates a hardware and software architecture for aggregation-free and privacy-aware mobile crowdsensing by integrating software and hardware design, edge computing, distributed spatiotemporal optimization, and machine-learning-based privacy protection. Without aggregating raw sensor data to a central server, this project passes latent representations of user data among edge servers until they recover the data of all areas by spatiotemporal interpolation.

Adequate managing of risk is critical for a viable insurance industry. Most insurance, re-insurance, catastrophe modeling, and data services firms have concluded that climate risk poses unique challenges that are holding back this sector of the economy. Challenges include the non-linear and interconnected nature of climate risks, the uncertainty of global climate scenarios, and the paucity of critical actuarial data. As a result, insurance markets are struggling to balance consumers? interests for access to affordable insurance against the insurers? need to remain solvent. The proposed formation of an industry-university cooperative research center (ICURC), the Center for Innovation in Risk-analysis for Climate Adaptation and Decision-making (CIRCAD), and funding of its full Center planning process, will address the need for more science-based research on the systemic challenges posed by climate risk the creation of novel new insurance strategies and products. The proposed Center consists of two university Sites (University of Georgia and Duke University). It will engage a diverse collection of interested parties as Center members who represent the insurance sector and its value chain. Members of the Center pay a membership fee to join. This industry money is then used to fund university-faculty proposed projects that address the highest priority sector needs that are collectively determined by Center members. The proposed Center will undertake interdisciplinary, high-impact, pre-competitive research that seeks to both improve climate risk modeling as well as foster broader, sector-wide innovations in risk distribution and assessment that align with industry products and practices now impacted by the unpredictability brought on by climate change. Broader impacts of the work include providing solutions to ensure financial protection in times of crisis, as well as incentivizing societal risk reduction, safeguarding vulnerable communities, and catalyzing the development and deployment of climate solutions for other sectors of the economy that require synergistic risk signaling and management capabilities. Other broader impacts include recruiting, mentoring, and developing a diverse, highly-trained, climate-ready workforce.<br/><br/>The proposed Center for Innovation in Risk-analysis for Climate Adaptation and Decision-making (CIRCAD) will focus on tackling the present insurance crisis. It is motivated by developing creative and implementable solutions for the insurance industry whose losses are being driven by climate change. This will take place through cutting-edge research and cross-sector collaboration. It will also address regulatory issues and the need to create a climate-resilient society by overcoming a lack of balance in the industry which creates market inefficiencies in the form of obscured price signals and misaligned incentives which discourages public and private investment in climate-friendly projects. The proposed Center will focus on advancing insurance solutions at a systems level. Realization of the vision requires interdisciplinary, high-impact research that integrates data science and modeling, risk assessment and decision theory, and economics and policy. These element must be brought together to create and evaluate innovative and actionable climate risk management strategies, products, and practices. The proposed Center will consist of 25 or more faculty and senior researchers at Duke and the University of Georgia in the fields of engineering, climate science, public policy, decision science, economics, law, statistics, and computing. The faculty team is poised to engage with the insurance industry and other interested parties to develop a portfolio of sector, high-priority, high-impact projects. Anticipated intellectual advances include: identification of analytical and governance strategies for effective and equitable management of climate-related financial risk; improved understanding of subjective climate risk perceptions and their effect on risk management decisions; determination of the link between extreme heat and health outcomes; development of national-scale Bayesian probabilistic methods for multi-hazard characterization; and development of resilience metrics to inform planning, protection, and investment. Such advances will not only support the needs of the insurance sector, but, by disseminating the knowledge and tools produced by this research to communities, policymakers, and non-governmental organizations, will enhance climate decision-making and resilience on a national scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People who work outside or who do not have adequate air conditioning are increasingly suffering from heat exposure in the summer months. In addition, extreme weather such as convective storms, flooding, and tornadoes can cause injuries and death. Floods from extreme rain events can also lead to exposure to things such as harmful algae blooms and sewage contamination of surface, well, and civic water supplies. There is also an increasing awareness of how petrochemical compounds being released, unintentionally or intentionally, into ground and surface water impact human health. This was recently illustrated by the train derailment and release of dangerous organic compounds from derailed tank cars in East Palestine, Ohio. In all of these and in similar cases, there is an opportunity for geoscientists (those who study the Earth and climate systems) and health scientists (those who study the effects of exposure to environmental triggers on people) to better communicate and work together. In this conference, the first of its kind in the Midwest,  geoscientists and medical/health researchers and their students will be brought together to increase collaboration between the two fields. Anticipated results of such collaborations include better understanding of environmental triggers of health problems and a reduction in the negative impacts of climate change on human health and its disproportionate impact on minority and vulnerable communities. Broader impacts include plans to develop training for geoscience students and expand possible job opportunities for them in the health/medical arena. Mentors and role models at the conference will include members of underrepresented groups, policymakers, community members, and policymakers from the region. A further goal will be to engage early career researchers, students, and members from groups underrepresented in the sciences in the proceedings to bring their perspectives and knowledge to the table and increase their participation in climate/human health activities and research. <br/><br/>Climate change is one of the most significant threats to human health this century. Addressing this challenge will take a concerted effort requiring many disciplines in the scientific community to work together. This conference connects two critical fields in this area: geoscience and health science, and their researchers and practitioners. These two fields work on related, but different, aspects of the climate crisis; and collaboration between them is needed so holistic approaches can be developed that accelerate understandings and mitigation of climate-driven health problems. The conference is the first of its kind in the Midwest/Ohio Valley region. It is focused on addressing threats of climate and environmental change to human health; and involves sessions on the largest geo-health issues in the Ohio Valley, which includes parts of Pennsylvania and the states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. Topics addressed include (1) human health impacts of increased levels of contaminants in the environment; (2) impacts of extreme heat; (3) toxic, harmful algal blooms, and (4) impacts of flooding on water quality and contamination due to sewer overflow. Conference outcomes include developing new collaborations between researchers in the Earth, social, and health sciences; outlining and fostering development of new undergraduate and graduate courses at the intersection of geoscience and human health; panel discussions on science communication, community-engaged research, and careers in the environmental health sciences; and political advocacy for a healthier environment. Discussions will take place on future directions and new initiatives in the area, such as what needs to be done in the future versus what is being done now and how Earth and health scientists can better collaborate to accelerate solutions to environmentally triggered health problems. The urgency of the convening stems from the fact that the targeted region of the country, over the last few years, has experienced dramatic, climate, geo-health related incidents and problems highlighting the urgent need for closer collaboration between the geoscience and health/medical communities to protect public health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Engineering undergraduate populations are becoming more diverse in terms of sociocultural identity, exposure to technology and preferences for teaching approaches. This IUSE Level 2 Engaged Student Learning project proposes Universal-Design Learning (UDL)-based curricular changes to undergraduate mechanical and aerospace engineering courses. The UDL framework emphasizes learning experiences that are accessible and effective for all learners, regardless of their individual differences, by considering students? individual strengths, weaknesses, motivational factors and curricular preferences. The project will explore how laboratory curriculum design and student assessments (rooted in student strengths) can be made flexible and designed to ignite learner interest thus enhancing the quality and quantity of time students spend learning engineering concepts. The broader impact of the work is to establish a foundation for STEM instructors to create more inclusive learning environments that resonate with diverse students.<br/><br/>UDL, defined in the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 as a ?scientifically valid framework for guiding educational practice,? puts the burden of change on the curriculum. By facilitating the design and implementation of a flexible, responsive curriculum, UDL offers options for how information is presented, how students respond or demonstrate their knowledge and skills, how learning is assessed and how students are engaged in learning. The goal of the project is to explore and assess student perceptions, engagement, and learning outcomes that result from modifying, using the UDL framework, three undergraduate courses within the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at Rutgers University. Investigators will also acquire insights on how the educational infrastructure of the department is transformed due to those changes. Sophomore, junior, and senior level classes will be adapted to include labs developed from a prior project that focused on development and assessment of virtual labs for a senior lab course. Research questions are posited to be investigated by a sequential mixed method and exploratory research approach. Findings will be disseminated to engineering education researchers, STEM educators, and high school students via engineering experiential learning activities, publications, presentations, and professional development workshops. This project offers a roadmap for transforming conventional engineering educational philosophy and has the potential to significantly improve access and quality of learning for diverse engineering student communities.

Prototyping PCBAs is a key element in the innovation process for all electronics from consumer goods to medical devices, but current PCBA prototyping services are limited by manual steps and supply chain shortages. The artificial intelligence innovation of this project will save the customers time through strategic automation, shortening innovation timelines, and bringing new products to market faster. Currently, other countries are still dominating the PCBA market share, serving many customers from the United States. There is an opportunity to provide high-quality, cost-competitive manufacturing in the United States to better serve the market and meet the rising demand for PCBAs. Additionally, investment in domestic manufacturing will strengthen electronic manufacturing capabilities, reduce dependence on foreign markets, and protect intellectual property.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create a service that provides customers with a rapid PCBA prototyping service. The project employs computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques to ensure the manufacturability of customers? designs and find components to satisfy the customers? designs while ensuring the designs can be manufactured in a blistering three days. The project will automate many of the manual steps associated with quoting and manufacturing a PCBA. One of the most time-consuming steps of quoting a PCBA is determining a set of components that will satisfy a customer?s design and which can be sourced within the manufacturing time frame. Building on the component selection algorithm developed in the SBIR Phase I project, which reads the property text from the customer?s designs to find components that satisfy the customer?s specifications, will build a system for matching components to a footprint (the copper landing pad on the board onto which a component is soldered). This will allow for rapid quoting, component substitution, and manufacturability checks, all of which will make PCBA prototyping fast and easy for the customer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mental healthcare costs in the U.S. ($280 billion per annum) and this tool may improve the efficiency and efficacy of clinician/patient meetings. This platform has important potential impacts as poor mental health is disabling, distressing, and expensive for the individuals affected, their families and communities, and society at large. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a digital front door to the mental health system. The solution is a mobile triage, treatment planning, and monitoring tool that combines a video interface with an internal Electronic Medical Record interface. This tool improves access to care, increases patient and provider flexibility and efficiency, presents patients a choice of interviewers, produces perfect fidelity interviews that include a searchable verbatim record in video and text forms, and creates video records of patients' mental states. In previous technical iterations, the tool was found to be clinically effective in diagnosing and recommending treatment plans. There is no other mental health triaging tool available that makes use of recorded videos for timely, efficient mental health diagnosis and treatment. Prior research has demonstrated the feasibility and clinical outcomes of this approach, while also demonstrating that the solution improves the efficiency and well-being of providers by reducing the time for a clinician to assess a patient from 60 minutes to 30 minutes while maintaining the quality of the assessment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both conditions decrease quality of life and contribute to a substantial economic burden. Current intranasal sprays do not account for differences in nasal anatomy.  We know that the shape of the noses changes as we age and is different between ethnicities; however, we do not know if these differences decrease the benefits of nasal sprays. The goal of this project is to investigate the differences in drug deposition from nasal sprays among diverse groups using experimental and computing models. By studying how nasal sprays are absorbed in individuals with diverse ethnic backgrounds, genders, and ages, this research seeks to improve nasal spray delivery.  The broader impacts of this project include improving drug delivery methods for other nasal conditions, potential applications in nasal vaccine development, and fostering diversity in STEM education and research by providing opportunities for underrepresented students.<br/><br/>This project will employ particle image velocimetry (PIV) testing, subject-specific model development from CT scans, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to investigate intranasal corticosteroid spray (INCS) deposition patterns in diverse nasal cavities. Through the integration of experimental measurements and computational simulations, the project aims to develop accurate prediction tools for INCS drug deposition with three research tasks: (i) PIV measurements of the flow field near the exit of the nozzle in the drug spray for the three most-widely used over the counter (OTC) INCS to serve as the initial condition for the CFD modeling; (ii) CFD model development to investigate the drug deposition process in INCS; and (iii) Analysis of drug deposition difference among diverse groups  using CFD model validated by measurements in 3D printed models reconstructed from CT scans. The successful completion of this research will not only provide insights into drug delivery mechanisms, but will also contribute to the development of more effective nasal drug delivery systems. Additionally, this project will enhance undergraduate and graduate STEM education by integrating research findings into coursework and providing research opportunities for underrepresented students. Overall, this project has the potential to significantly impact both scientific knowledge and societal well-being by improving drug delivery methods and promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the project will create a paid, faculty-mentored summer research program for undergraduate students early in their collegiate experience. The transition between the first and second year of college is a crucial time for students deciding whether to pursue further study in STEM. Summer research experiences are widely available at multiple institutions but may not be accessible to students early in their course of study, especially before they have foundational laboratory and research experience, and at a time when they have high potential to leave the sciences. Additionally, students at Regis University are increasingly first-generation, Latine, working, and may have additional demands on their time such as family commitments. Creating paid opportunities for students to participate in research through a faculty-mentored summer research experience has the potential to remove barriers for students to explore scientific research.  Students who need summer employment will be able to support themselves financially while building important career-relevant skills that may be difficult to achieve during a regular semester.<br/><br/>This program aims to increase retention and success of undergraduates in the life sciences by: 1) decreasing barriers to participation in an authentic research experience with faculty; 2) guiding students through mentored research at a critical transition point between the first and second year of undergraduate study; 3) providing professional development and a cohort model to better prepare students for further education or careers in STEM and strengthen their feelings of belonging in STEM; 4) building an educational environment in which faculty mentors learn from students about their needs and how best to support them. The project will use previously validated tools to measure changes in scientific skills, self-confidence, and well-being. These assessments will allow for an assessment of which project interventions impacted student retention and will capture how students were most impacted.

But the ability to understand how iron availability in the ocean impacts phytoplankton productivity and carbon drawdown is constrained by a limited understanding of the reservoirs of iron in the marine environment. This research into phytoplankton iron storage mechanisms provides new insights into the production of biogenic molecules by phytoplankton which help maintain iron in the well-lit upper layers of the ocean. The study characterizes the mechanism of a novel protein ? a copper-based ferritin ? and explores how this environmentally abundant class of proteins may provide an ecological advantage to some marine phytoplankton and help explain the maintenance of dissolved iron in the water column. It advances the understanding of how iron limitation affects marine ecosystems and their capacity to draw down carbon. Furthermore, the project supports the development of a K-8 educational module using hands-on tidepool chemistry and ecology to teach children broader concepts in biogeochemical cycling. This educational effort targets 600 seventh-grade students from a middle school serving underserved populations in Southeastern San Diego. The educational module is to be made broadly available via marine science educational websites.    <br/><br/>This project is guided by mechanistic, phenotypic, and biogeochemical hypotheses.

Glaciers that end in water often thin and retreat faster than those ending on land because they lose  ice through melt below the waterline and through the breaking off of icebergs. While many  past researchers have studied the workings of glaciers ending in the ocean, very few have  focused on glaciers that end in lakes and how these two types of glaciers might function  differently. In our project, we will study a set of three glaciers that end in lakes;  collecting information about the glaciers themselves, the lakes they end in, and the  sediment moving between the glacier and lake. The investigators will work with students from two different programs in Alaska to identify how much extra ice is being lost due to these lakes and how much that ice loss matters for how the glaciers will change over the coming decades.<br/><br/>Globally, lakes at the end of glaciers have grown rapidly over the past decades. However, it remains unclear whether lakes are growing as a passive response to glacier retreat that is  largely driven by changing atmospheric conditions (warming air temperature and/or declining  winter snowfall), or whether the lakes themselves are driving this retreat by enabling extra ice loss. Our team brings together a glaciologist, an oceanographer, and an Arctic earth  system modeler to quantify the amount of ice lost through iceberg production and underwater  melt on three large glaciers draining the Juneau Icefield that end in lakes. The investigators will collect both short- and long-term observations of conditions in the lake (depth,  temperature, suspended sediment concentration) using a sonar system and probes cast from a  boat, as well as buoy-mounted instruments. The investigators will also measure glacier ice thickness and  speed using ground-based radar, GPS systems, and satellite observations. These datasets will be fed into computer models to estimate how much additional ice is being lost due to the  lake, how this will change in the future, and how much the lake?s presence will alter the  glacier?s overall ice loss over the 21st century. This information will help us understand how fast glaciers across the world will change over the coming decades, which will enable better management of downstream ecosystems and water  resources, as well as promoting climate change resilience. In addition to the science objectives, the project will strengthen the STEM workforce by partnering with undergraduate programs to develop computational workshops and broaden representation within the earth science community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The timing and location of ice formation in the fall also affects how sediment moves through the region. The proposed work will explore how waves, storms, and sediment interact during fall in the Alaskan Arctic. This new understanding will result in better predictions of ice formation at the coastline, which varies significantly in space and time. The project will use observations obtained from instruments deployed on the seafloor and from ships to watch how freeze-up occurs over a section of the coastal Alaskan Arctic. We will introduce new ways of making measurements in the Arctic, that are both cheaper and better-adapted to the harsh environment, which can be incorporated into future work. These observations will be compared with seasonal and prior datasets to understand how the freeze-up may vary in different years. Scientists will engage with middle and high school students both locally (in the Arctic) and from the continental US. This work will focus on developing a coastal ocean unit, which teaches students about the science and walks them through building and deploying small instruments.<br/><br/>The rapid decline in landfast ice in the coastal Arctic is increasing the duration of wave exposure and strength of wave energy reaching the coast each year. Because landfast ice forms in shallow water, sediment entrainment into the ice also plays a key role in mediating export. The proposed work will address fundamental feedbacks and connections of physical processes on the Alaskan Arctic shelf during fall freeze-up. This new understanding will enable better predictions of seasonal and decadal changes in landfast ice formation, which has a high amount of variability on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Analysis will also improve our understanding of the sediment pathways during the stormy fall period. The field experiment will use moorings, autonomous systems, and seafloor cables to capture the spatial and temporal variability in freeze-up processes over a region on the Alaskan Beaufort shelf. The research will take a nested approach, utilizing seasonal observations and pre-existing inter-annual time series to capture the roles of offshore forcing, local hydrodynamic processes, and air-sea exchange. Measurements will be made using novel integration of multiple new low-cost telemetered sensors, amphibious drones, seafloor cables, and Arctic-hardened moorings, building capacity for future autonomous observing and monitoring systems adapted for the coastal Arctic.

The structural scaffold of a blood clot is a mesh of fibers, composed of a biomaterial called fibrin. These fibers trap blood cells and other blood components during the clotting process. When wound healing is complete, the fibers must be digested by enzymes in the blood in order to prevent significant risks from a blocked blood vessel such as strokes and heart attacks. During the digestion process, flowing blood and blood cells subject the fibers to significant tension. However, it is not well understood how these forces on fibrin impact the digestion process. The aim of this research is to test several hypotheses about how tension could regulate the breakdown of blood clots. Results from this research will yield a deeper understanding of the causes that lead to increased risk of strokes and/or heart attacks due to improper blood clot digestion, providing avenues for improved national health. In addition, studying the blood clotting and breakdown processes involves collaborative research in biochemistry, medicine, engineering, mathematics, and physics, thus providing a robust training atmosphere for student researchers. This project will support a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate researchers at three different institutions, providing them with a multidisciplinary training environment. Moreover, the lead investigators will develop curricular materials to teach principles about tension and blood clot digestion to elementary school students using LEGOs during a 1-week STEM summer camp.  <br/><br/>During blood clot formation, fibrin polymerizes into a 3-dimensional gel wherein the fibers have inherent tension. After polymerization, clots are subject to applied tension, which originates from numerous sources including platelet contraction and blood hemodynamics. The fibrin network must withstand vascular forces during wound healing but then, to avoid blood vessel occlusion, must be dissolved through a process called fibrinolysis. A key knowledge gap lies in understanding the extent to which, and the mechanisms by which, inherent and applied tension regulate the fibrinolytic process. This project extends initial findings that inherent tension accelerates lysis while applied tension hinders lysis to perform the first multiscale study correlating amounts of fiber and clot tension with fibrinolytic rates. Each aim of this project centers on testing one hypothesized mechanism of how tension affects lysis: 1) causing structural rearrangements in the gel prior to lysis, shrinking the volume and expelling lytic enzymes; 2) altering the binding kinetics of enzymes to fibrin; and 3) causing structural rearrangements within the fibers and network structure during lysis, thereby clearing the fibrin more rapidly from the clot volume. Each hypothesis will be tested using a multidisciplinary research approach across three different institutions involving tensile testing, time-resolved microscopy, and mathematical modeling. This work will result in a combinatorial multiscale mathematical and experimental model that can predict lytic outcomes as a function of mechanical forces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A growing trend in the field is the utilization of biomaterial scaffolds that aim to achieve controlled delivery of growth factors to cells during tissue regeneration. However, the resulting growth factor concentration profiles to which cells are ultimately exposed to during delivery can be difficult to predict because they are influenced by a complex array of biochemical interactions in the tissue between growth factors and scaffold material, extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents, and cell receptors. The primary research goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program project is to develop a new approach for assessment and optimization of emerging growth factor delivery scaffolds. The project utilizes computational models to predict cell exposure profiles of administered growth factors for different biomaterial scaffold designs. The project tests the hypothesis that scaffolds that are predicted to achieve optimal growth factor exposure profiles to cells will yield improved tissue regeneration outcomes. The successful completion of this research project can lead to a paradigm shift in the field of growth factor delivery, whereby scaffolds can be designed and evaluated based on computational model predictions. Further, this project develops educational activities to introduce K-12 students to fundamental concepts of molecular transport and the field of tissue engineering. The project also develops undergraduate training and lab-based graduate coursework to train the next generation of tissue engineers in growth factor transport phenomena.<br/><br/>The primary research goal is examined through a cartilage tissue engineering model system consisting of the delivery of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) to chondrocyte-seeded constructs. TGF-beta is delivered via slow release from scaffold-conjugated heparin affinity domains. Reaction-diffusion models are developed to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of free TGF-beta in constructs for different scaffold design parameters, varied by factors of heparin concentration, heparin affinity, and TGF-beta loaded dose. Models account for the salient chemical reactions that act on TGF-beta in the construct extracellular milieu, including reversible binding/release to scaffold affinity domains, binding to cell deposited ECM, and cell-mediated internalization. Models further incorporate non-linear chemical reaction kinetics, using a Brunauer?Emmett?Teller (BET) multilayer absorption model to account for TGF-beta aggregation at binding sites and Michaelis-Menten kinetics to account for saturating rates of cell-internalization. Through model predictions, the project tests the hypothesis that scaffolds that promote optimal exposure doses of TGF-beta to chondrocytes will yield constructs that better recapitulate the composition, structure, and functional properties of native hyaline cartilage, marked by native matched mechanical properties, while mitigating features detrimental to hyaline cartilage tissue function (type-I collagen, cell hypertrophy, and chondrocyte clustering).

Glaciers that end in water often thin and retreat faster than those ending on land because they lose  ice through melt below the waterline and through the breaking off of icebergs. While many  past researchers have studied the workings of glaciers ending in the ocean, very few have  focused on glaciers that end in lakes and how these two types of glaciers might function  differently. In our project, we will study a set of three glaciers that end in lakes;  collecting information about the glaciers themselves, the lakes they end in, and the  sediment moving between the glacier and lake. The investigators will work with students from the Alaska  Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) as well as the Juneau Icefield Research Program  (JIRP) to identify how much extra ice is being lost due to these lakes and how much that ice loss matters for how the glaciers will change over the coming decades.<br/><br/>Globally, lakes at the end of glaciers have grown rapidly over the past decades. However, it remains unclear whether lakes are growing as a passive response to glacier retreat that is  largely driven by changing atmospheric conditions (warming air temperature and/or declining  winter snowfall), or whether the lakes themselves are driving this retreat by enabling extra ice loss. Our team brings together a glaciologist, an oceanographer, and an Arctic earth  system modeler to quantify the amount of ice lost through iceberg production and underwater  melt on three large glaciers draining the Juneau Icefield that end in lakes. The investigators will collect both short- and long-term observations of conditions in the lake (depth,  temperature, suspended sediment concentration) using a sonar system and probes cast from a  boat, as well as buoy-mounted instruments. The investigators will also measure glacier ice thickness and  speed using ground-based radar, GPS systems, and satellite observations. These datasets will be fed into computer models to estimate how much additional ice is being lost due to the  lake, how this will change in the future, and how much the lake?s presence will alter the  glacier?s overall ice loss over the 21st century. This information will help us understand how fast glaciers across the world will change over the coming decades, which will enable better management of downstream ecosystems and water  resources, as well as promoting climate change resilience. In addition to the science objectives, the project will strengthen the STEM workforce by partnering with undergraduate programs to develop computational workshops and broaden representation within the earth science community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The leading green steelmaking process, green hydrogen direct reduction and electric arc furnace (H2 DR-EAF) is expensive, energy-intensive, and requires high-grade iron ore as a starting material, which accounts for only 3% of global iron ore resources. This project develops on a sustainable, low emissions, and energy-efficient laser heating method to convert low-grade iron ore into molten iron metal and steel. This approach lowers costs by 1) enabling the use of the low-grade feedstocks that make up 97% of the world?s iron ore supply and 2) implementing an energy-efficient and thermo-kinetically optimized heating approach. The commercialization of this technology would deliver a sustainable steelmaking process that is more cost-efficient than current green steel technologies and has a lower carbon footprint than any existing steelmaking approach, helping the United States steel industry secure a competitive advantage over other global producers of green steel. This approach has the potential to yield a market-disrupting technology poised to supplant carbon-intense, resource-demanding iron and steel production processes, resulting in an economically viable pathway to green steelmaking.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a laser furnace that thermally decomposes iron oxide while reducing the amount of hydrogen required to produce green iron and steel, using blue laser diodes to rapidly heat iron ore to temperatures needed for thermal decomposition.

In Objective 1, decomposition of low-grade iron ore, which contains <67% iron and higher amounts of impurities, into wstite will be pursued by exploring the relationship between ore composition, laser heating parameters, and purity of the partially reduced ore. The thermal decomposition reaction mechanism and degree of decomposition will be evaluated. Objective 2 focuses on reducing wstite from low-grade ore to iron metal, leveraging unprecedented temperatures enabled by laser heating, and investigating methods and process conditions to minimize hydrogen demand.

Specifically, agricultural IoT acts as a conduit between traditional weather-dependent agricultural decision-making and data-driven computational intelligence by facilitating cost-effective and energy-efficient data collection in outdoor environments. Long Range, or LoRa, emerges as a wide-area IoT framework poised to empower agricultural IoT. Nonetheless, deploying LoRa for next-generation agricultural IoT encounters obstacles due to the varied deployment settings, limited power resources, and absence of connectivity infrastructure in rural locales. This project endeavors to lay the groundwork for a space-air-ground integrated agricultural IoT design. The research endeavors to establish a novel LoRa-based network architecture to foster a reliable, sustainable, and ubiquitous agricultural IoT network. The project promises to furnish granular field data to propel advancements in irrigation, disease mitigation, and climate management. Furthermore, it furnishes educational materials on agricultural IoT development for undergraduate and graduate studies. Additionally, it provides research training opportunities for underrepresented students across diverse demographics.<br/><br/>To achieve its objectives, the project develops a new framework for cross-soil, ultra-low-energy, and large-scale IoT deployment in agricultural settings, with the overarching aim of establishing a reliable, sustainable, and ubiquitous IoT infrastructure for precision agriculture. The project encompasses three primary components: (i) Design of novel antenna configurations to bolster the reliability of cross-soil communication for subterranean sensors. (ii) The development of battery-free, high-throughput backscatter LoRa tags and the utilization of drones as mobile power sources to mitigate energy consumption at sensor nodes. (iii) Development of an alternative backhaul for LoRa gateways in rural regions that leverage the global coverage capability of Low-Earth-Orbit satellites to. Through collaboration with academic and industrial partners, this project explores diverse applications of the proposed agricultural IoT, including irrigation systems, water quality management, disease control, and greenhouse gas reduction.

For example, when hammering a nail, one hand must stabilize the nail while the other swings the hammer. When opening a jar, the hands need to exert pressure in different directions and our grip adjusts based on the size and texture of the surface that is gripped. Both these activities require the hands to have different responsibilities and movements, but the hands must cooperate to accomplish the task. This project explores how cooperative bimanual control is learned and how the coordination adjusts when the requirements change. The findings should be informative for rehabilitation after stroke, especially for the many activities of daily living that rely on bimanual asymmetric movements, as well as for optimal design of human-machine interfaces.  In addition, planned classroom demonstrations and workshops provide local elementary school students with robotics experiences during the school year and in the summer.<br/> <br/>Bimanual tasks typically involve an unequal distribution of control, with the two limbs having complementary responsibilities and motor functions. Although there is a growing literature on the neural processes involved when learning new motor patterns using one limb, there is a substantial gap in our understanding of how the two hands coordinate control in accomplishing a single task, particularly when the required motor functions are not the same. The investigators use a novel motor coordination task that requires the two limbs to control different aspects of a single virtual object. This allows them to explore how perturbations of one feature of the coordinated task influence the behavior of the other, unperturbed limb. Other conditions probe the relationships between motor actions and the perception of coordinated control (i.e., the sense of agency). By quantifying these changes in behavior, these studies provide a deeper understanding of how we accomplish daily activities that require different, but synchronized motor functions from the two hands (e.g., chopping food, fastening buttons, etc.) and will provide a foundation for studying how the brain controls bimanual actions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SafeInsights is a national R&D infrastructure that will support transformational learning research by coordinating research across an initial set of more than a dozen securely connected digital learning platforms (DLPs). SafeInsights' privacy model keeps student information secure while allowing researchers to leverage learning data from individuals across multiple DLPs. Such data may span years and multiple educational institutions, thus enabling researchers to undertake longitudinal studies to investigate, for example, how conceptual understanding develops over time. With its unique privacy-protecting approach, its large scale, and its emphasis on students, educators, and researchers from various backgrounds, SafeInsights will unlock discoveries about learning that lead to predictors of academic success and persistence. Such findings will eventually benefit tens of millions of students across all educational levels in the United States, as more DLPs are connected. This infrastructure is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for STEM Education through the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-2 Program. <br/> <br/>SafeInsights will enable secure data analysis and controlled research studies within authentic learning environments and will leverage learner data from different types of platforms to address scientific inquiries with greater depth and breadth than previously achievable. To support scientists, educators, educational institutions, state and local education agencies, and edtech companies in answering important questions about STEM learning, this pioneering scientific cyberinfrastructure will build shared technical and logistical capabilities as well as secure enclave infrastructure deployed inside its collaborating DLPs. By enabling the combination of individual outcome and performance data from multiple DLPs with additional information (e.g., profile data, past and current course performance, enrollment, and completion pathways) provided by Student Information Systems (SISs), the envisioned research infrastructure enables education researchers to initiate large cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of student learning and achievement across a range of content areas and contexts. Enclaves unlock profound insights into learning by enabling researchers to conduct sophisticated analyses of rich, large-scale datasets from real-world applications, thereby revealing complex patterns and relationships. SafeInsights aims to lower the cost and expand the scale and scope of learning research, increase its agility, accelerate research-to-practice conversion, and provide access to STEM research opportunities to everyone. As SafeInsights uncovers advanced understandings of human learning, educators will be able to respond through new personalized programs, pedagogies, and policies with the goal of providing each learner with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to succeed in today?s classroom and tomorrow?s workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tokenization represents a new frontier in finance that was originally pioneered in blockchain and cryptocurrency, and has many commercial applications to make payments and securities settlement faster, more transparent, and more reliable in the current regulatory environment. FBDAs are not blockchain based and can improve upon existing global payment solutions in making systems more scalable, easier to integrate with other payment systems, and more privacy-enhancing for institutions and consumers. The platform also allows for open sourcing and increased financial inclusion through the digital identity solution which gives the ability to move assets without friction globally. The commercial potential of FBDAs is significant, and tokenization products can be sold to domestic and international commercial and central banks, and allow third-party providers to build out their own financial products. This project will explore the technical market for FBDA-based tokenization and gain user feedback to improve the technology?s commercialization potential. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to research and create a production-ready (99.999% availability with defined RPO/RTOs) File-Based Digital Assets (FBDAs) product, a novel tokenization scheme applicable to not only currencies and tokenized deposits, but also to securities and other assets. FBDAs improve upon many of the issues that Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and traditional database systems have, particularly in the realms of scalability, interoperability, privacy, and programmability. FBDAs utilize a flexible fixed-denomination asset design that is simpler and more robust than Unspent Transaction Output UTXO-based systems while beating the performance of Account-based systems. In addition, FBDAs allow for a disaggregation of the asset layer from the transaction layer, thereby allowing for easier separation of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and from programmability rules for specific transactions. The Phase I project proposes to further explore different design choices of FBDAs and get technical and customer validation on achieving scalability, interoperability and privacy prior to large scale commercialization. The Phase I project will include a sandbox environment to test out different architectural setups, modeling of different financial instruments to expand tokenization potential, and to receive customer feedback from real-world financial institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goals of these meeting are to (a) share the most current and impactful research in plant vascular biology at a range of scales, which includes everything from gene networks and proteins to global climate change models; and (b) build a representative, inclusive and equitable scientific community to ensure that research in this field continues to advance for the benefit of society as a whole. Because plants serve as a critical link between the earth's soils and our atmosphere, an understanding of plant vascular biology underpins some of the most urgent societal and environmental challenges of the 21st century. These include improved global food security, reduced agricultural water consumption, increased bioenergy production, enhanced carbon storage in natural ecosystems, and bioremediation (i.e., decontamination) of contaminated soils. The two-day GRS that precedes the full GRC is restricted to very early career scientists (i.e., doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers) and includes a career mentoring panel. Thus, one of the primary expected outcomes of this conference is to develop a more diverse (i.e., demographically-representative), inclusive and equitable workforce in plant biology who are prepared professionally to tackle these challenges. The open sharing of current scientific results at these meetings is expected to lead to new directions and productive collaborations.<br/><br/>Themes for the 2024 GRC and GRS Multiscale Plant Vascular Biology are Plant Vasculature and the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum and Plant Resilience to Stress, respectively. The 2024 GRC program includes 31 speakers and discussion leaders organized in sessions on plant vascular development; stomatal control and regulation; the role of the root microbiome and mutualisms on the ability of plants to tolerate abiotic stress; computational and imaging techniques for improved plant phenotyping; the role of vascular biology in sustainable cropping systems; hydraulics from the rhizosphere to landscape; phloem transport and within-plant carbon dynamics; and plant vascular function in a changing climate. Special emphases this year include the transfer of carbon compounds as well as water, including bidirectional transfer (e.g., into the soil vs. soil-to-atmosphere); the importance of the soil-root biotic interface; and greater representation of work in agricultural and intensively-managed systems. GRC/GRS structure includes ample time for discussion, all of which occurs under an ?off-the-record? policy in order to foster the most up-to-date and forward-looking exchange of ideas. It is expected that multiple collaborations will develop from these meetings that will meaningfully advance the field. Collectively, attendees will identify the most pressing gaps in our understanding of plant vascular biology and thus the highest priorities for research, as well as the most effective and promising techniques to address them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Glaciers that end in water often thin and retreat faster than those ending on land because they lose  ice through melt below the waterline and through the breaking off of icebergs. While many  past researchers have studied the workings of glaciers ending in the ocean, very few have  focused on glaciers that end in lakes and how these two types of glaciers might function  differently. In our project, we will study a set of three glaciers that end in lakes;  collecting information about the glaciers themselves, the lakes they end in, and the  sediment moving between the glacier and lake. The investigators will work with students from the Alaska  Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) as well as the Juneau Icefield Research Program  (JIRP) to identify how much extra ice is being lost due to these lakes and how much that ice loss matters for how the glaciers will change over the coming decades.<br/><br/>Globally, lakes at the end of glaciers have grown rapidly over the past decades. However, it remains unclear whether lakes are growing as a passive response to glacier retreat that is  largely driven by changing atmospheric conditions (warming air temperature and/or declining  winter snowfall), or whether the lakes themselves are driving this retreat by enabling extra ice loss. Our team brings together a glaciologist, an oceanographer, and an Arctic earth  system modeler to quantify the amount of ice lost through iceberg production and underwater  melt on three large glaciers draining the Juneau Icefield that end in lakes. The investigators will collect both short- and long-term observations of conditions in the lake (depth,  temperature, suspended sediment concentration) using a sonar system and probes cast from a  boat, as well as buoy-mounted instruments. The investigators will also measure glacier ice thickness and  speed using ground-based radar, GPS systems, and satellite observations. These datasets will be fed into computer models to estimate how much additional ice is being lost due to the  lake, how this will change in the future, and how much the lake?s presence will alter the  glacier?s overall ice loss over the 21st century. This information will help us understand how fast glaciers across the world will change over the coming decades, which will enable better management of downstream ecosystems and water  resources, as well as promoting climate change resilience. In addition to the science objectives, the project will strengthen the STEM workforce by partnering with undergraduate programs to develop computational workshops and broaden representation within the earth science community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The sizes of large DLRMs are dominated by their embedding tables, which may be of 10s or even 100s of gigabytes, making it an appealing choice to save such tables in cloud servers. Unfortunately, querying the embedding tables on cloud servers demands sending in clients' private data and thus may leak their sensitive information. The privacy issue has become a major challenge when deploying large DLRMs in the cloud. Adopting traditional tree-based oblivious memory protocols can provide highly robust privacy protection, but suffer from significant performance degradation and low memory space utilization. This project focuses on developing a hardware-software co-design framework to address the performance and space issues of privacy protection for cloud-based DLRMs. The project?s outcomes will have significant societal impact by servicing personalized recommendations securely in the clouds. The investigators will actively recruit and train undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups, and provide research and education opportunities for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The project centers around three innovative approaches: (1) A hardware-software co-design for significant performance improvement; (2) The effective integration of non-volatile memory for significant memory space utilization improvement; (3) The exploration of distinct DLRM access behaviors for secure protocol designs. In particular, the project exploits the on-chip trusted computing hardware on modern processors and the distinguishing characteristics of DLRMs such that secure operations can be partitioned among clients and trusted processors for effective privacy protection with low overhead. The project contains concrete steps to develop schemes for one security group of users accessing one cloud server as well as for multiple security groups of users accessing multiple cloud servers. Successfully addressing the performance and space issues of privacy protection can advance the modern computing paradigm in the AI era, i.e., how the large DLRMs as well as modern AI models are deployed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All students recruited at the freshman level will receive a four-year scholarship, and sophomore students will receive three years of scholarship funding. This program will support the advancement of scholars through the establishment of a Scholar Success Mentoring Network, and optional participation in a variety of program activities, including undergraduate research experiences, monthly professional development workshops, networking opportunities, formal summer internships/externships, and a variety of cohort-building activities. As part of this program, scholars can opt to be trained in an ambassador's program that teaches the students how to assemble, stock, and maintain a mobile touch tank, and transport them to rural areas across the state to teach youth about marine life and careers in the marine sciences. This program gives scholars valuable practice in leadership, facilitation, and professional communication skills, and instills positive perceptions of STEM to students, parents, teachers, and the public at large.

Complementing these advances is the significant progress in decentralized optimization software that enables the basic functionalities of such distributed networked systems, including cooperative control, network information fusion, network coordination, and distributed data mining/learning. However, information sharing over such large networks creates vulnerabilities and concerns about privacy, which can be especially acute in privacy-sensitive applications such as smart metering and connected vehicle networks. Differential privacy is the most widely used protective mechanism for privacy due to its simplicity, scalability, and strong resilience against attempts to recover sensitive information from post-processed data. However, all existing differential-privacy solutions for decentralized optimization face the dilemma of how to achieve data privacy protection by compromising the optimizer's speed of convergence rather than its accuracy. This project leverages on the PI?s recent discovery that it is possible to achieve differential privacy guarantees without compromising utility by leveraging on the optimizer's speed of convergence rather than its accuracy. Specifically, the project will establish theoretical and algorithmic foundations for the problem of ensuring differential privacy in decentralized optimization without losing provable optimality. In addition to broadly enabling more effective privacy protections for decentralized networks, the project will impact education by enriching the current curriculum on control and networked systems, and training undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary information privacy research and its applications. <br/><br/><br/>This project will establish theoretical and algorithmic foundations for ensuring differential privacy in decentralized optimization algorithms without losing provable optimality.

The coating thermal noise is reduced, primarily, by lowering the mechanical (elastic) loss of the mirror materials. The core research focus of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) Center for Coatings Research (CCR) is the development of mirror coatings with low mechanical and optical losses for use in A+ and 3rd generation detectors. The research mission of the CCR includes: understanding and reducing mechanical loss in amorphous metal-oxides, the most widely-used materials in mirror coatings; and developing and testing crystalline (AlGaAs) coatings, which have demonstrated low losses for small mirrors. On a longer time-scale, the CCR is developing mirrors compatible with the proposed 3G detectors? cryogenic operation. <br/><br/>The residual noise visible in the time-domain gravitational waveforms of black hole mergers first recorded by Advanced LIGO is mostly due to quantum noise of the light and thermal noise due to the mirror coatings. Since that first discovery much progress has been made in reducing quantum noise and the coupling from seismic, scatter and jitter noise, leaving coating thermal noise as the dominant barrier limiting gravitational-wave astronomy in the most sensitive observation band. Reducing this noise source for future generations of detectors requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses, and forms the main goal of the CCR. The CCR combines groups working on computational modeling, coating deposition, and characterization of atomic structure and macroscopic material properties. These components are often performed by four diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these communities focused on a unified research goal. In its first two years of operation, research in the CCR has identified different structural motifs associated with room-temperature vs cryogenic mechanical losses, which led to synthesis of germania (GeO2) films giving rise to the lowest-loss amorphous oxide film other than silica. Going forward, this structural guide will serve as a paradigm informing the development of high-refractive index amorphous coatings with lower elastic loss. In addition, thermo-optically-optimized AlGaAs crystalline coatings have demonstrated a coating thermal noise well below the requirements for A+, and the CCR has generated a development schedule to scale up these coatings to LIGO mirror sizes and will continue investigations into these materials. Other research paths include: exploring deposition techniques to produce ?ultrastable glasses? using amorphous metal-oxides; and stabilizing amorphous coatings against crystallization in order to allow elastic loss reduction via high temperature annealing either with nano-layering or with different doping materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research proposes the development of advanced sensor technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable an inexpensive hardware infrastructure to control indoor space conditions autonomously. This concept will foster broader adoption of advanced automation technologies among buildings, especially multi-dwelling and residential buildings. One main benefit of indoor automation is its deep energy savings. The Department of Energy estimates that if all residential units deploy energy-saving features offered by building automation solutions, 1-3 quadrillion units of energy will be saved yearly. This can reduce the nation's annual energy budget by $18-$36 billion and eliminate the release of 60-120 metric tons of CO2 emissions. Alongside energy efficiency, the associated societal benefits of the proposed project can potentially save lives. The proposed solution integrates a higher level of security protection in residential spaces in addition to its ability to monitor occupants' health in real time. These life-saving features can significantly limit the impacts of intrusion events and medical emergencies.<br/><br/>The proposed project will advance the scientific knowledge required to approach full autonomous control in indoor spaces. Today?s building automation solutions utilize a primitive sensor infrastructure, which has high deployment costs and limits the solution benefits. This leads to a diminished value proposition and a small adoption rate. This project proposes the utilization of advanced perception sensors in buildings. The rich data stream these sensors offer allows for a compact hardware infrastructure to autonomously control indoor spaces and improve the living experience within buildings. Advances in sensing technologies were fundamental to the recent exponential growth in the autonomous driving industry and the realization of a generation-old dream. This research project aims to instigate a similar technological evolution in the autonomous control of indoor spaces. An upgraded implementation of the Phase I evaluation study will be developed to mitigate Phase I learnings. The project also aims to develop a production-ready implementation of the developed sensor technology to prepare it for commercialization and market introduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Giessen of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor is investigating the structure and function of peptide-modifying enzyme filaments found in both bacteria and archaea. Filament formation by non-cytoskeletal enzymes represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to control the activity or localization of metabolic enzymes inside cells. Filamentous enzymes have only recently begun to be characterized in detail, largely due to the historic difficulties in their biochemical and biophysical analysis. The proposed work will generate new insights into the structure and molecular mechanisms that govern the self-assembly and catalytic activity of enzyme filaments. These newly generated insights could lay the groundwork for using peptide-modifying enzyme filaments in sustainable biocatalysis and chemoenzymatic synthesis applications. This proposal will enable undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows to acquire specialized training in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and the biochemical and biophysical analysis of protein filaments. This project will also support the undergraduate Michigan Synthetic Biology Team.<br/><br/>There is a need in modern enzymology and biocatalysts research to establish better and more generalizable methods for expressing, purifying, characterizing and more fully developing filamentous proteins. This research project seeks to explore the ability of diverse cyclodipeptide oxidase (CDO)-like enzymes to form filaments, determine their high-resolution structures, and investigate CDO-like enzyme catalysis and substrate range. Diverse protein biochemical and biophysical techniques will be used to study filament self-assembly. Single particle cryo-EM will be carried out to determine high-resolution structures of CDO-like enzyme filaments. Substrate screens of cyclic dipeptides, amino acids, and related small molecules will be employed to explore the substrate range and catalytic properties of CDO-like enzyme filaments. Information from this study could provide new molecular level insight into the structural determinants of CDO-like enzyme filament formation, substrate selectivity, and catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the major challenges still facing the modern power systems are their vulnerability to large-scale disruptions, failures, or even outages. Large-scale disruptions in power systems follow a sequence of less severe anomalous events that gradually stress the system over time. System operators are often unaware of these gradual changes since such changes often either appear insignificant or are not even detectable when they fall within a normal range of noisy variations. As a result, the system operators remain oblivious to the emerging anomalies that lead to a progressively less secure system state and a sequence of disruptions that gradually become more severe. The objective of this project is to develop theoretically-principled and efficient algorithms that can predict and rectify large-scale disruptions based the gradual anomalous changes .<br/><br/>This research program addresses the following research questions. Question 1: How can we quickly and reliably determine whether there are ambient-level anomalies in the system and distinguish them from random noise? Question 2: If the system is deemed to contain anomalies, how can we quickly localize them? Question 3: When the existing anomalies are localized, how can we determine their subsequent risks to the system? Do the localized anomalies have locally-contained risks, or can they lead to anomalies of larger scales and risks?  Our approach to developing provably correct algorithms that recognize all the complex constraints of power system dynamics involves advancing the existing theories in change-point detection, active sensing, probabilistic graphical models, and graphical neural networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A basic problem in dynamics is to understand how quickly a deterministic process, for example particles in a gas sampled at regularly spaced intervals, randomizes. The regular spacing amounts to sampling the system at the integers. Answering the subtler questions in this area often requires a non-trivial understanding of the properties of the integers. Conversely, a basic problem in number theory is to show that fundamental properties of the integers (e.g their prime factorization) randomize, and here techniques from dynamics can be useful. As for probability, questions from mathematical physics led to the development of techniques for the study of interacting systems, for example the macroscopic properties of a gas of electrons constrained to a surface. It has been recently understood that these techniques are applicable in a number theoretic context, for example in the study of the Riemann zeta-function, a basic function governing the finer properties of the integers. A second objective of this proposal is to develop such techniques further in a number theoretic context. The PI will continue training graduate students and mentor postdocs on topics related to this research.<br/><br/>In dynamics the focus of this project is to understand the convergence of dynamical systems over sparse sets (primes, squares) at every point in the space, with a particular focus on horocycle flow. A second goal is to reexamine the work of Elkies-McMullen on the gap distribution of square-roots of integers modulo one from the perspective of the circle method. In probability theory, the focus is on developing further connections with branching random walks and statistical mechanics, specifically by focusing on the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture and its other avatars.

Examples include anomaly detection using video streams, line-outage detection in power grids, onset detection of a pandemic, and detection of cyber-attacks. While traditional techniques assume that probability distributions for both before and after the change are known or can be found, this assumption is unrealistic in most scenarios of practical interest. As an alternative to such traditional change-detection approaches, this project considers the use of deep neural networks to effectuate change detection. However, rather than attempting to learn probability distributions directly, the project leverages the recently-demonstrated ability of deep neural networks to learn the ""score"" (i.e., the gradient of logarithm of the probability density) from the data and aims to develop score-based algorithms for change detection. These scores can be learned for a large class of high-dimensional data models using modern tools of artificial intelligence and rendering the developed algorithms applicable to a broad class of change-detection problems. Fundamental mathematical theories will be developed in the project to establish the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed methods, and the developed algorithms will be validated on several publicly available machine-learning and anomaly-detection datasets. Broader-impact aspects of the project include providing algorithms to the wider community for solving change- and anomaly-detection problems across multiple, disparate fields as well as activities centered on integrating research into graduate coursework and providing opportunities for underrepresented students to participate in the project.<br/>  <br/>The algorithms developed in the project will be based on the score of the data; this score can be explicitly derived for known unnormalized models or can be learned using score matching using an artificial neural network, and developed algorithms will be optimized to detect the changes with the minimum possible delay while avoiding false alarms. The project is divided into four technical thrusts. The first thrust will develop the fundamental theory for score-based quickest change detection for independent and identically distributed single-stream data under Bayesian, generalized Bayesian, and minimax problem formulations. While the performance of classical change-detection methods depends on the Kullback-Leibler distance between the distributions before and after the change, it will be established that the performance of the score-based methods depends on the Fisher distance between distributions. The second thrust will develop robust methods for detecting changes under modeling uncertainty, using the Fisher distance between the elements of the uncertainty classes. The third thrust will define the notion of scores for dependent data sequences and obtain optimal algorithms for detecting changes, with the scores in this case being based on the gradient of the logarithm of the conditional densities. The fourth and final thrust will develop algorithms for distributed change detection wherein multiple agents may have partial knowledge of the distributions and may only communicate with their neighbors in a geographical area.?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to be a part of the answer this call by pairing two goals in one initiative. The first goal is to train and guide PhD students in inclusive mentoring and leadership by pairing them one-on-one with rising high school seniors in individual summer research projects and guiding the mentoring process between graduate researchers and students. The second goal is to bring hands-on research experience to local high-school students, prioritizing those from underrepresented backgrounds, so that they can learn about the range of opportunities in geoscience and its value and relevance as a STEM discipline and so that they have an easier transition into college.  <br/><br/>Training future geoscience professionals in inclusive mentoring and leadership of a diverse group of talented pre-college students will help participating individuals at both levels to not only remain in or intentionally choose a geoscience career, but to thrive and positively impact society for a sustainable relationship with a myriad of Earth and environmental systems. This project applies a two-pronged approach that targets students at distinct critical junctures in geoscience talent pathways: 1) professional development of graduate students working towards academic and non-academic careers in geoscience, and 2) providing paid, multi-week summer internships to high-school students deciding on colleges and majors. The two main goals of this program are 1) to solidify graduate students' attitudes and identities as geoscience leaders and lifelong mentors, and 2) to provide mentored research experiences to incentivize the diverse college-bound high school students to intentionally choose geoscience as a major. Each high-school summer intern completes an individual Earth or environmental science project under supervision and mentorship from a graduate student mentor, in conjunction with organized and cohort-based exposure to computing and data science, field work and instrumentation, and communication. The graduate student mentors are formally trained to support cross-cultural relationship and advised in the practice of mentoring via a series of workshops and individual feedback sessions administered by a faculty mentoring expert. The interns' projects are guided by project proposals written by the graduate students and revised with coaching from the faculty project leaders.<br/><br/>This proposal was funded through support from the Directorate for STEM Education's IUSE Program and will be managed by the Directorate for Geoscience's GEOPAths Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hispanic students at Southern Adventist University have higher attrition in STEM than other racial/ethnic groups, but the university currently lacks an understanding of the attrition points and causes and the knowledge and skills needed to plan evidence-based solutions. To gain this understanding and knowledge, this project will (1) document STEM student attrition related to campus climate; academic, social, and financial supports; curriculum and pedagogical strategies; and career awareness; (2) identify evidence-based practices to improve retention of students in STEM; and (3) train faculty and staff to implement identified strategies in a future Track 2 Implementation and Evaluation Project. These activities will contribute to improved outcomes for retention and success and lead to better outcomes for all students. As STEM careers pay well and are in high demand, retaining and graduating more STEM majors helps the communities and industries in need and supports young professionals aspiring to increase their social mobility. The results will be relevant to other institutions and will contribute to the body of knowledge, with special relevance to religious-based institutions and small southeastern universities. Faculty training will have lasting benefits at the university as faculty apply their learnings in future classrooms and contribute to a more inclusive campus climate and strong STEM culture.<br/><br/>The Planning Project will result in a comprehensive needs assessment and identification of evidence-based strategies to improve student retention in STEM programs at a small university that is the only HSI in Tennessee. The specific aims of the project are to (1) collect and analyze institutional and student data to identify causes of attrition and perceived needs related to sense of belonging, self-efficacy, cultural inclusion, campus climate, financial or mental health support, social support, and knowledge of career pathways; (2) identify a ranked list of strategies from a literature review to address the identified needs and learn about these strategies from the literature and peer institutions; and (3) identify faculty training needs based on literature review, discussions with other institutions, and collected data and implement faculty training for at least 75% of the STEM faculty. The internal study and evaluation will generate an analysis of factors that impede or promote success in students and will identify causes of attrition or success for students in STEM, perceived student needs, institutional strategies for working with students in STEM, other institutions? use of strategies, and the training needs of STEM faculty. Results will generate the knowledge needed to develop a future Track 2 proposal and contribute to the body of knowledge related to student success in STEM.

The technology is based on a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) technology that may enable safe sharing of large volumes of private data for research and development in a variety of domains including healthcare, medicine, transportation, and social sciences. In addition, the technology may reduce the security and privacy costs for cloud systems. In the public cloud systems, the global cumulative data breach cost in 2022 was $9.26 billion. Out of the total data breaches that took place in 2022, 64% of the breaches happened while processing the data. Using this technology, the data stays encrypted even while processing, i.e., data stays private even in the event of a data breach. Public cloud service providers may save the $5.93 billion in costs associated with a data breach, and at the same time continue to process the data. This solution may reduce the impact of data breaches and the associated costs and help cloud companies provide better data privacy services.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) hardware accelerator. The technology uses novel dataflows as well as custom microarchitecture to reduce the gap between encrypted and non-encrypted processing performance down to 25x. A prototype has been tested successfully in an academic setting using Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC). In addition, testing is planned for deployment in commercial cloud systems. FHE solutions based on Central Processing Units (CPUs)/Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are 3-4 orders of magnitude slower than solutions that operate on non-encrypted data, making them impractical. Custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)-based FHE solutions are promising, but they cannot be readily deployed in the cloud and are very expensive. This novel technology may be deployed in public and private cloud environments with little modification to the existing cloud infrastructure making this solution both practical and inexpensive.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to exploit the characteristics of transition metal complexes for the development of novel catalysts and study their activity with polyvinyl chloride from both an experimental and a computational standpoint. The project lies at the nexus of organometallic chemistry, materials, and computational chemistry and the collaborative research team is, therefore, well positioned to provide students with interdisciplinary education and training. Outreach activities involving the general public and underrepresented groups will also be part of the funded project.  <br/><br/>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the third-most-produced synthetic plastic polymer worldwide, is widely used in various industries and household applications. However, traditional PVC remediation and upgrading strategies require high energy inputs and generate environmentally hazardous chemical species, such as HCl. This project aims to explore earth-abundant molecular catalysts for the conversion of PVC into environmentally friendly and value-added polymers under ambient conditions. In this research project, the research team will (i) examine a rational combination of ligands and metal centers for the hydrodechlorination of alkyl C?Cl bonds, (ii) explore C?Cl carboxylation using CO2 as the C1 feedstock, and (iii) investigate the effects of temperature and PVC configuration on electrocatalytic C?Cl activation and PVC upgrading. Preliminary results show that Ni-pincer complexes can convert alkyl chlorides into alkyl carboxylates in high yields under ambient electrochemical conditions. The proposed design principles will allow the methodical study of molecular catalysts and electrochemical conditions to facilitate the activation and conversion of PVC C?Cl bonds. This project combines molecular engineering, materials science, spectroscopy, and computation and has the potential to inform future sustainable chemistry solutions regarding polyvinyl chloride transformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Also, this area features one of the world?s most densely distributed network of refineries as well as major shipping, industrial, tourism, and medical interests. During the summer season, warm and moist air moves inland in the early afternoon as a sea breeze, which is the primary focus for the development of deep convective clouds (DCCs). These clouds are responsible for the regular occurrence of thunderstorms and heavy precipitation that impact vulnerable populations and infrastructure due to lightning strikes and flooding. Past research has shown how aerosols derived from urban and industrial areas influence the development of DCCs, which in turn, impact the severity of lightning and precipitation associated with sea breeze thunderstorm events, demonstrating the importance of cloud invigoration by elevated levels of aerosols in this region. However, an accurate assessment of the aerosol effects remains challenging, because of highly complex cloud charging and precipitation processes and the difficulty in representing the aerosol and cloud processes in atmospheric models. <br/><br/>The scientific initiative of this study takes advantage of a unique opportunity to compare and contrast the behavior of sea breeze thunderstorms which develop in polluted and clean environments along the Texas Gulf Coast region using long-term lightning, aerosol, and meteorological measurements such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and winds. The central hypothesis of this research effort is that the combination of elevated aerosol levels from various emission sources as well as favorable thermodynamic and dynamic conditions (i.e., high humidity and sea breeze lifting) renders the southeast Texas region highly susceptible to aerosol-cloud-lightning interactions. This study will address three scientific questions: (1) What are the observational evidence and mechanisms for the impacts of aerosols derived from anthropogenic (urban/industrial/vehicle) and natural sources (e.g., agriculture and wildfire smoke) on the evolution of cloud microphysics, charge structures, and precipitation patterns of lightly-forced, warm season (June-September) sea breeze convection along the Texas Gulf Coast? (2) How can the evolution of DCCs be better constrained and simulated, in model sensitivity by inclusion of detailed aerosol, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), ice nucleating particles (INP), and lightning parameterizations, to account for (a) clean vs. polluted conditions, (b) similar vs. variable dynamic/thermodynamic settings, and (c) continental vs. marine interface regimes? and (3) How can atmospheric models be improved for accurate simulation and quantification of aerosol-lightning-precipitation interactions by using the multiscale-resolution/multiplatform-observations provided by the recent NSF Experiment of Sea Breeze Convection Aerosols and Precipitation (ESCAPE) and DOE Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER) intensive observation periods, Houston Lightning Mapping Array (HLMA), stationary and mobile radar assets, aircraft, and auxiliary ground-based aerosol, cloud microphysical, meteorological, and trace gas measurements? There are four specific scientific aims in this project, including (1) climatological observation analysis of aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and lightning, (2) convective cell tracking using polarimetric radar and HLMA data, (3) assessing the impacts of CCN and INP on clouds, precipitation, and lightning using cloud-resolving models, and (4) inter-comparison between model simulations and observations with a focus on anomalous and extreme sea breeze thunderstorm cases which exhibit major lightning and flooding activity. The analysis procedures developed in this project will lay the foundation for future applications using lightning as a key measurable quantity to assess the aerosol-cloud interaction. The modeling work will establish the relative importance of the various CCN, INP, and secondary ice processes (e.g., ice splintering/multiplication) in cloud formation, charge separation, and precipitation and will improve the representation of the mixed-phase clouds and ice processes in regional and global models. <br/><br/>A better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms for the aerosol microphysical effects will contribute to accurate weather forecasting and climate prediction. Outcomes from this research will be disseminated by conference presentations, media, and published journal articles to advance science. Social media outlets will be utilized in near real-time to update municipal stakeholders on the progress of this study. Examples include highlighting lightning development and lightning safety via news/radio/internet programs, aiding first responders and emergency management officials (police/fire/rescue), and providing forensic support to areas vulnerable to rapidly changing weather and climate conditions. Moreover, the results of this research aid in supporting STEM education efforts for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, especially from communities within the study region (e.g., Houston, Galveston, and Beaumont). The students will benefit by establishing future connections with the broad academic/research communities in atmospheric, environmental, climate, and earth sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our goal is to take advantage of data sources which are becoming more common in the power domain, namely the proliferation of smart meters which record electricity consumption at 15- minute intervals. We will develop machine learning methods which predict electricity consumption at the day-ahead scale from this data. Such learning must be done with privacy guarantees for end-users who are hesitant to share information with a central authority. Due to the way power markets are structured, making these predictions more accurately than current practice allows electricity to be produced at lower cost and in a more environmentally sustainable way. We propose to train recurrent neural networks for time series prediction without sharing the full data sets from each user with the utility, but rather through repeated interactions between the utility and the consumer which preserve the privacy of consumer data. To make this vision a reality will require two scientific advances. First, we must develop effective, sample efficient, and fast methods for ""nested"" federated learning which can deal with models that are simultaneously local and global. We need a global model to capture common patterns of electricity consumption across households, but we also need a local model to capture the idiosyncratic features of each household. The second advance required is a neural architecture for learning from time series data which is capable of capturing long-term dependencies in the data. Indeed, electricity consumption exhibits long-term dependencies and human behavior is complex so that any underlying pattern is always corrupted by noise which cannot be modeled directly.<br/><br/>The development of the methods proposed here could reduce the cost of electricity throughout the United States. More indirectly, it could provide additional steam to initiatives to install smart meters which can measure electricity consumption at a higher level of granularity, while at the same time assuring consumers that their data is safe. Finally, it could make it easier to introduce weather dependent renewable generation, which creates a new set of challenges for predicting spatiotemporal electricity supply-demand equilibria associated with consumer demand response incentives designed by utilities to adapt to uncertain renewable generation forecasts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our ability in controlling and designing increasingly complicated power grids will no doubt be constrained by our understanding of the complex and nonlinear interactions among their components. The power flow equations are nonlinear equations that are ubiquitous in all power system studies. They describe the intricate balancing conditions on the active and reactive power injections, and their solutions give operating points for the underlying power network. There can be more than one potential operating point due to the inherent nonlinearity of the power flow equations. The problem of finding some or all of them has been an active research topic, and it is the focus of this project. It is well known that there is a deep connection between the connectivity structure of a network and its power flow solutions. Changes to a network naturally induce qualitative changes to its power flow solutions. Yet, a rigorous understanding of connection disturbances on power flow solutions remains elusive. This research attacks this problem from a new viewpoint. This project includes educational component and will lead to the development of software packages.<br/><br/>This project revolves around the rigorous and global analysis of the effect of ?topological disturbances? (changes in network topology) on the full set of power flow solutions. Based on the theoretical foundation and promising results established by the PIs? recent works, the proposed research aims to develop a deep understanding of the impact of topological disturbances on power networks from the viewpoint of convex geometry. This will be done through the machinery of toric deformations, which links the study of convex polytopes with power flow solutions. The concrete goals include developing theoretical underpinnings of the geometry of the full set of power flow solutions, establishing a global understanding of how these solutions are influenced by topological disturbances, and implementing new solvers for power flow equations based on this understanding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The communities of photosynthetic microbes living near sea level on coastal bay sediments form cohesive mat structures. Microbial mats are considered the oldest ecosystem, and they include microbes that are producers and consumers of organic carbon. These mats act as nature's storage units, locking away carbon and helping to regulate Earth's climate. Since microbial mats are found on nearly 128,000 square kilometers of Earth?s coastline, they are likely important contributors to the global carbon cycle. However, the chemical, geological, and biological factors that determine how effective mats are at storing carbon are not well understood. This project will investigate how well microbial mats store carbon on timescales of tens to thousands of years. To address this question, the team of scientist will conduct research on the tidal flats around Corpus Christi Bay in Texas. They will use a suite of field- and lab-based analytical methods to study mats at multiple sites. Results from this project will help improve predictions of how sea-level rise affects carbon cycling in coastal systems. The research conducted will benefit the scientific community by providing new data on carbon storage, which is a critical component of climate change research. The project will support a new collaboration between research groups at two universities, including one designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution and a Minority-Serving Institution. These groups will share resources and expertise and provide student research opportunities that will help train new scientists from diverse backgrounds. The project includes outreach activities that engage local high school and middle school students, a high proportion of whom are economically disadvantaged and from minoritized populations.<br/><br/>The fate of organic carbon in sediments is a function of the intrinsic chemical structures in organic matter and extrinsic factors related to the burial environment. The high organic carbon content of intertidal microbial mats makes them potentially important carbon sinks when mat-derived organic matter is buried, especially during periods of sea level rise when sediment accommodation space increases. The goal of this study is to quantify spatial and temporal differences in the burial rates and preservation of organic carbon in intertidal microbial mat ecosystems. This will be accomplished by assessing the effects of physiochemical parameters in the tidal flat environment on (1) the composition of bulk organic matter produced in microbial mats, (2) the controls on organic matter oxidation and decomposition in tidal flats through diel and seasonal variability of redox and light conditions, and (3) the down-core early degradation of buried mat-derived organic matter during late Holocene/anthropogenic sea level rise. The science team will make field measurements, collect sediment and pore water samples for chemical analysis, and conduct laboratory analyses of pore water chemistry, reactive oxygen species, low molecular weight organic acids, pigments, lipids, bulk organic matter characterization, 16S-rRNA metagenomic analysis, and geoluminescence dating. The project will focus on the factors that affect the oxidation state of carbon in bulk organic matter and specific molecules and how the carbon oxidation state affects organic matter decomposition. Variation in the balance between aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophy is hypothesized to affect the decomposition of specific chemical structures in organic matter. By advancing knowledge of the chemical composition of mat-derived organic matter and the factors affecting its decomposition, this work will help define the roles of microbial mat ecosystems in the global carbon cycle.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Chemical Oceanography and Marine Geology and Geophysics Programs in the Division of Ocean Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, modulating endothelial cell function at specific locations within the body without infusing drugs into the entire circulation is a major challenge. The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) proposal is to tackle this important question by developing a technology for the targeted stimulation of enendothelial cells using pulsed electric fields that can be delivered to the desired region of the body using medical devices. The project will study pulsed electric field waveforms that enable controlled and specific alteration of the endothelial cell barrier function, identify the biological pathways that mediate this response, and test this approach for enhancing drug delivery to tumors. The novel tools and knowledge gained from this proposal can enable new investigations on the role of endothelial cells in various diseases and improve treatment outcomes for millions of cancer patients. Synergistic educational and outreach activities in this proposal will develop project-based activities to create awareness in undergraduate and high school students about medical devices that use electricity as a form of therapy and to prepare them to enter the workforce or pursue higher education on the topic of medical devices.<br/>  <br/>The endothelial cells (ECs) lining blood vessels regulate the passage of ions, transmit bioelectric signals, and manifest altered barrier permeability during electrical stimulation of nerves and skeletal muscles. Despite such diverse bioelectric responses, ECs have not been conventionally considered to be electrical excitable. The research objective of this proposal is to investigate whether pulsed electric fields (PEFs) can be designed to selectively stimulate ECs to alter vascular permeability, and to elucidate the signaling pathways mediating this response. The underlying hypothesis is that PEF will trigger actin stress fiber remodeling in ECs, thereby increasing capillary barrier permeability from translocation of junction proteins with signaling along the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) ? adherens junction axis. In Aim 1, the kinetics of barrier function alteration in EC monolayers treated with PEF will be quantified. In Aim 2, the role of VEGFR ? cadherin signaling in altering barrier permeability will be evaluated, and potential angiogenic responses studied. In Aim 3, PEF parameters will be designed for selective stimulation of ECs, and then tested for augmenting chemotherapy delivery to tumors. Novel tools and mechanistic investigations that define the signaling mechanisms mediating EC responses to PEF can open several new lines of multidisciplinary investigation and enable major advances in drug delivery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite a rise in Hispanic student enrollment and graduation rates over the past few decades, Hispanic students remain underrepresented in STEM degrees and the STEM workforce. At rural HSI community colleges, many Hispanic students are unable to access required science lab coursework or engage in highly valuable undergraduate research experiences in STEM disciplines due to location constraints. Online courses in community college settings have the potential to increase access, persistence, and degree completion by removing location constraints and allowing students to continue to make progress toward their degree. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that many under-resourced institutions, such as rural HSI community colleges, faced major challenges when seeking to deliver high-quality online laboratory science courses. Similar capacity constraints limit Hispanic students' undergraduate research opportunity at rural HSI community colleges. This research will contribute to the growing body of literature on the role that online instruction and undergraduate research experiences can play in advancing equity in STEM opportunities and outcomes via evidence-based best practices designed to build stronger STEM pathways and identities among Hispanic students at a rural HSI community college.<br/><br/>The aims of this project are to (1) increase access to STEM for rural students at and HSI and (2) improve degree attainment and transfer opportunities for HSI students pursuing STEM education. To address these two areas for improvement, SFSC will partner with the University of Florida Institute of Higher Education (UF IHE) to implement evidence-based best practices that increase access to required science courses and to undergraduate research experiences. These interventions will include high-quality online courses, innovative virtual science labs, and expanded undergraduate research experiences. Expected project outcomes include increased student enrollment in laboratory science courses, increased persistence of students in STEM majors, and increased participation of students in undergraduate research experiences. The collaborative research team from SFSC and UF IHE will explore the project's influence on students' STEM course participation, success, and persistence in their major. The project team will also examine faculty records for participation in undergraduate research experiences and conduct semi-structured interviews to better understand students' engagement and experiences with intervention components. Following an independent external evaluation, results of this work will be broadly disseminated at the state, regional, and national levels, including Florida College System institutions, professional associations, higher education research networks, and peer-reviewed journals focused on higher education and STEM education. To ensure broad dissemination, the project team will also create a dedicated project website and promote deliverables through the UF IHE website.

This innovation may impact on the lithium battery industry, fostering a sustainable supply chain and responsible sourcing for clean energy manufacturing. The cathode is the positive end of a battery and represents the bulk of its cost. Current state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries are reaching their theoretical limit due to the limited lithium storage capacity of cathodes. The surge in electric vehicles and demand for lithium-ion batteries will escalate critical raw materials demand, with the extraction of metals linked to environmental and geopolitical concerns. Global energy demand for electrifying 1.3 billion light-duty vehicles using current cobalt-based cathodes requires tens of megatons of cobalt. Conversely, this nickel- and cobalt-free cathode technology brings substantial value by introducing cathodes based on the raw materials available in the U.S. This technology alleviates the strain on nickel- and cobalt-based cathodes, de-risking the battery materials supply chain in terms of cost and sustainability.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a new cathode materials through unique molecular tuning of chemical structures free using critical raw materials such as nickel and cobalt. The technology introduces cathode materials using abundant metals available in the U.S. The successful development of these new cathodes will enhance fast charging, safety and lithium storage capacity and, more importantly, strengthen domestic manufacturing of sustainable battery materials. The innovative cathode will improve into both conventional and advanced lithium batteries (lithium metal and solid-state batteries). This technology translation aims to achieve a low cost/kilowatt-hour and establish a sustainable battery material supply chain through domestic manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The timing and location of ice formation in the fall also affects how sediment moves through the region. The proposed work will explore how waves, storms, and sediment interact during fall in the Alaskan Arctic. This new understanding will result in better predictions of ice formation at the coastline, which varies significantly in space and time. The project will use observations obtained from instruments deployed on the seafloor and from ships to watch how freeze-up occurs over a section of the coastal Alaskan Arctic. We will introduce new ways of making measurements in the Arctic, that are both cheaper and better-adapted to the harsh environment, which can be incorporated into future work. These observations will be compared with seasonal and prior datasets to understand how the freeze-up may vary in different years. Scientists will engage with middle and high school students both locally (in the Arctic) and from the continental US. This work will focus on developing a coastal ocean unit, which teaches students about the science and walks them through building and deploying small instruments.<br/><br/>The rapid decline in landfast ice in the coastal Arctic is increasing the duration of wave exposure and strength of wave energy reaching the coast each year. Because landfast ice forms in shallow water, sediment entrainment into the ice also plays a key role in mediating export. The proposed work will address fundamental feedbacks and connections of physical processes on the Alaskan Arctic shelf during fall freeze-up. This new understanding will enable better predictions of seasonal and decadal changes in landfast ice formation, which has a high amount of variability on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Analysis will also improve our understanding of the sediment pathways during the stormy fall period. The field experiment will use moorings, autonomous systems, and seafloor cables to capture the spatial and temporal variability in freeze-up processes over a region on the Alaskan Beaufort shelf. The research will take a nested approach, utilizing seasonal observations and pre-existing inter-annual time series to capture the roles of offshore forcing, local hydrodynamic processes, and air-sea exchange. Measurements will be made using novel integration of multiple new low-cost telemetered sensors, amphibious drones, seafloor cables, and Arctic-hardened moorings, building capacity for future autonomous observing and monitoring systems adapted for the coastal Arctic. Outreach efforts during the project will engage regional high school students, as well as students who have never experienced the Arctic. We will continue building on a ?Coastal Oceanography? unit developed over the past four years for high schoolers in an Alaskan Arctic village, expanded to include the middle school, and incorporating virtual lessons with annual in-person activities to deploy small student-built instruments. Additionally, we will establish ongoing engagement with middle school science classes in three locations with in-person visits prior to the fieldwork, live-stream events during the cruise, and follow-up visits afterwards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Narrow-band absorber dyes provide spectral shaping, modifying light reaching the eye. The technical hurdles to be addressed is developing a fabrication method which ensures the dyes and PVA are embedded into a stable format such that they do not leach out during prolonged submersion and wear. A novel chemical process that combines dyes into a common solvent, when combined with the PVA-water solution will be integrated into a contact lens such that it permeates and impermeates the porous substrate without precipitating. Upon curing and cross-linking, this embeds less than a microgram of hydrophobic narrow-band dyes to create a thin and stable lens layer.

Inclusiveness is an important issue in these interactive narratives because on balance, their users are much more diverse than the people who design them.  Although there are methods that encourage designers to consider a wide range of potential users who are different from them, these methods often fail to account for deeper aspects of identity and representation.  This can lead to designs where both the content and form of the narrative use stereotypical, surface-level representations of people's differences, which in turn can degrade many people's experiences during use.  This project will use social theories that connect people's experiences and identities in order to develop new design methods that help narrative designers, users, and companies more deeply account for differences and create more inclusive and successful interactive narrative designs.<br/><br/>The project will start by identifying appropriate social science theories that provide useful context and guidelines for deeply engaging with identity and its effects on experience in the real world.  These theories will be used to critique and expand existing design methods used by professional interactive narrative designers, working closely with these designers through focus groups and co-design workshops to do the needed translation work from theoretical framework to design methodology.  Once candidate methods are developed, the project team will develop new pedagogical approaches and materials that will be used to teach and iterate on the methods.  This second activity will take place through a series of workshops and narrative design activities, working closely with both novice and expert designers.  Finally, the team will use content analysis and ludography to assess the results, comparing narratives designed with and without the methodology in terms of both expert-assessed quality and their potential impact on a wide range of users.  Together, the project will develop novel methods, guidelines, and frameworks for more representative narrative designs, as well as insights into how to better-use social science theories in technology design processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics have facilitated the availability of various types of genomics data and have significantly enhanced our understanding of the relationship between genomes and diseases. Additionally, the digitization of histopathology slides, has transformed pathology by enabling the identification and analysis of complex patterns and structures within tissue samples through computational methods. This project establishes a robust computational foundation by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods, especially deep learning, to integrate multiple types of molecular and pathology data. The integration of these data opens up new avenues for understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with diseases, thereby allowing for personalized prognosis, diagnosis, and treatments. The outcomes of this project contribute significantly to advancing biological sciences and improving human health by providing a means to address complex questions about the pathology and molecular mechanisms of various diseases. Furthermore, it contributes to education and training in the high-demand and multidisciplinary fields of bioinformatics, computational genomics, and medical image analysis.<br/><br/><br/>The integrative analysis of multimodal omics data poses challenges owing to its inherent complexity, encompassing issues like noise, nonlinearity, heterogeneity, correlation, high dimensionality, and multimodality. Traditional predictive methods struggle with these challenges, and while deep learning methods hold promise for handling complex data, they face limitations due to the aforementioned challenges and the relatively small sample sizes of omics data. To extend beyond conventional learning models, this project builds a precise data-driven phenotypic predictive model by developing novel methods within advanced deep learning frameworks to integrate multimodal omics data and leverage prior biological knowledge. This project  significantly advances knowledge in extracting accurate information from complex omics data by:  i) introducing an attention-based graph neural network learning algorithm to represent and integrate multimodal genomics data while incorporating prior biological knowledge; ii) developing a Transformer-based multiple instant learning algorithm to identify discriminative regions of pathology images using unannotated training images, and adapting graph neural network methodology to aggregate information from discriminative regions to represent pathology images; and iii) implementing contrastive learning for aligning features from multimodal omics data and their fusion for phenotype prediction while preserving the unique data distribution of each omic and prioritizing discriminative features and omics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ANNSIM trains students by providing access to expertise through ten tracks. In particular, cyberinfrastructure training will be provided through presentations of simulation software tools in the Annual Simulation Symposium as well as model libraries, repositories, and data formats in the Digital Twins and Cyber-Physical Systems track. Since advanced networks are important for cyberinfrastructure, ANNSIM also provides a track on telecommunication systems, which covers topics such as software defined networking, edge computing, and green and energy efficient communications. Improving the use of existing datasets and software, while supporting advances in networking, software developments, standards and certifications, will contribute to cyberinfrastructure research. In addition to these ten tracks, ANNSIM includes several in-depth tutorials, taught by international experts in their field. The ten tracks and the tutorials ensure that attendees are well-aware of advances in information technology systems through advanced software, data, networked systems, and simulation environments. By providing access to leading experts, ANNSIM ensures that the next generation of scientists has the tools, motivations, and career aspirations to contribute to cyberinfrastructure. Every NSF-funded participant will be matched with a mentor chosen among the experienced scholars in attendance, which will help build a professional network. <br/><br/>The conference includes a direct learning component providing multiple tutorials, so students can develop skills in specific software packages or apply advanced techniques relevant to research cyberinfrastructure. This research can range from software for digital twins to datasets and libraries in model-driven system design. The conference gives particular attention to students (e.g., a PhD Colloquium with presentations followed by interactive poster sessions), which helps connect with leading researchers to identify better tools and/or additional datasets for experiments. One barrier in cyberinfrastructure training for students is not just a lack of existing tools or repositories, but a lack of awareness about these tools. Keynote speakers in simulation conferences have a reputation for informing and motivating students in contributing to the cyberinfrastructure, for instance by covering methods and software for system and application performance. Attending these talks will ensure that students have specific directions to apply the tools that they have learned onto open research problems in cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, previous research has shown that these algorithmic tools can induce unfairness and cause disparities in individuals of varying race, gender, and socio-economic status. The traditional approach to this problem is to independently fix each given decision-making tool to make it fair. While valuable, this view fails to reason about the long-term impact on the complex socio-technical systems involved. This project will provide novel paradigms and foundations to adopt a long-term and in-context view of fairness within these systems. The research will take the academic study of fairness a step closer to practical issues and concerns related to educational opportunities.  This will lead to significant longer-term societal benefits. The project will support and promote education about responsible AI and machine learning and will broaden participation through workshops and mentoring activities.<br/><br/>The project combines tools from game theory, optimization, and machine learning to contribute new advancements to our scientific understanding of algorithmic fairness. It does so along three axes: First, it models how humans can strategically respond to high-stake machine learning algorithms and aims to understand the impact of such strategic behavior on fairness. Second, it proposes new modeling paradigms and approaches to fairness interventions for complex decision-making pipelines comprising many inter-connected stages. Third, it reasons about feedback loops and their long-term, inter-generational effects on disparities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The nervous system plays a key role in directing feeding behavior through the sense of taste, where specialized sensory cells detect chemicals in food and activate neural circuits that encourage animals to avoid potential toxins and consume beneficial nutrients. Taste loss is a common symptom of COVID-19 infection, and the recent pandemic highlighted the negative consequences of losing this chemical sense. However, many questions remain about how information about taste is encoded in the nervous system, even in normal conditions. Protein intake is essential in many animals, from humans to fruit flies, but protein needs change in response to internal factors such as diet and reproduction. Amino acids, the building blocks of protein, are detected by taste cells, but it is unclear whether sensitivity to amino acid taste changes based on an animal?s internal physiology. The research in this proposal will utilize the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to describe the genes, cells, and neural circuits responsible for amino acid taste, and determine if amino acid taste sensitivity is influenced by factors such as hunger and diet. By combining powerful genetic tools with simple behavioral assays, a diverse group of undergraduate students will contribute to this research through two courses and paid summer research experiences. Additional students will share scientific results and student narratives through Science Communication Internships. Overall, this project will help broaden the STEM workforce by providing accessible educational opportunities that build practical skills. <br/><br/>The sense of taste is often depicted as one cell type tuned precisely to one class of chemicals with one receptor. However, it is becoming clear from research in both Drosophila and mammals that gustation is not that simple: one tastant may activate multiple cell types or a single cell may express multiple receptors and detect many chemicals. Previously, the PI and others completed a detailed map of every taste cell across the Drosophila labellum (?tongue?), and preliminary data using in vivo calcium imaging to quantify taste cell activation revealed that at least one cell type is strongly activated by amino acids. In addition, stimulating the labellum with an amino acid mix led to a consistent proboscis extension response (PER), a simple feeding behavior that quantifies taste sensitivity. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that amino acids activate at least two classes of taste cells to drive flexible, taste-induced feeding behaviors that can change based on internal needs. The first aim will identify physiological factors that modulate the amino acid PER, while the second aim will uncover the full repertoire of cells and receptors necessary for amino acid detection combining calcium imaging and PER. The third aim will use connectomics to identify neural circuits of amino acid taste and determine if taste cell activation is modulated in response to protein needs. This research combines cutting-edge neurobiology tools with behavioral assays to ultimately uncover how taste circuits are modified at a cellular level to lead to flexible dietary choices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If a robot can reason about a child?s goals, intentions, and beliefs, then it can provide better help. Current approaches in social robotics have not used theory of mind reasoning (ToM). The goal of this research is to develop ToM algorithms, which will allow social robots to infer a child?s goals, intentions, and beliefs. The robot can then respond with more effective help. The algorithms use analogical reasoning to make each inference step. This provides transparency and explainability in the robot?s reasoning. The aim is that children and parents will see the robot as effective, helpful, and trustworthy. The outcome will contribute to more ethical applications of robots. The educational aspect of this project aims to create a more informed citizenry. The project will develop and integrate machine ethics materials across curricula. These materials will address the social and ethical implications of technology. For broader impacts, the research and educational goals of this project address the broader need in society for ethical technology. <br/><br/>From a technical perspective, there are three key goals for this research. The first is to develop algorithms for ToM reasoning. The second goal is to show that the algorithms are transparent and explainable. The third goal is to show that social robots using ToM reasoning will be more effective. The expected outcome is that people will have a more positive view of these robots. The robot needs to use ToM reasoning in two challenging situations. First, the robot may know something that the child does not know. Also, the child may know something that the robot does not know. To enable ToM reasoning, the project explores novel applications of analogical chaining. This approach uses analogies to make a series of inferences. The project lead will partner with developmental psychologists. Together, they will determine the effectiveness of the ToM reasoning. They will examine how parents and children perceive the robot. The development and evaluation of these algorithms will advance five critical research areas. First, the project will advance analogical reasoning. It will apply analogical reasoning to problems related to human-robot interaction (HRI). Second, the research will produce a novel algorithm for theory of mind reasoning for use in HRI. Third, the research will produce unique datasets featuring complex theory of mind scenarios. Fourth, researchers will provide new knowledge on how children and parents see robots. Last, the researchers will collect knowledge from experts. This knowledge will suggest how a robot should help and support children. An important broader impact of this project is the effects it will have on undergraduate students. The project aims to support the growing diversity of computer science.

Additional complexity due to magnetic frustration makes theoretical and computational study of such materials rather challenging, and many interesting questions remain unanswered. Yet, for the same reason magnetically frustrated materials feature novel physical properties, which are of both fundamental and potential technological interest. This project is aimed at achieving new advances in conceptual understanding of the microscopic physics of such materials through a combined effort of theoretical physics and computational materials science approaches. The theoretical and computational research will proceed in close collaboration with experimental groups studying the same materials.<br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's educational activities aimed at training undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral research associate in computational materials science. This training is expected to offer the students and postdoc an excellent opportunity to acquire knowledge in advanced electronic structure methods, state-of-the-art materials modeling techniques, and high-performance computing, which are essential for their future employment in academia or industry. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research on understanding quantum materials and phenomena related to frustrated magnetism. Magnetic frustration lies at the core of the notion of skyrmions and quantum spin liquids, and more often than not also triggers promising topological properties: Weyl and Dirac points, topological Hall effect, quantized anomalous Hall effect, controllable magneto-optics, and others. This project concentrates on electronic, transport and topological properties of frustrated magnets, using methods of theoretical physics and computational materials science.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to gain microscopic, materials-oriented insight into several novel classes of quantum materials with frustrated magnetism, providing a conceptual framework for design, discovery and application of relevant materials. Analytical modeling and both first principles (density functional theory and beyond) and second-principles (such as Monte-Carlo simulations utilizing first-principles-derived Hamiltonians) calculations will be employed. The research will approach the field of frustrated magnetism from both materials direction and physical effects direction. As such, the project has a potential to transform our understanding of the interplay between electronic structure, electronic topology, chemistry, crystallography and complex magnetic patterns, with an ultimate goal of providing a theoretical framework for synthesizing materials that can shape future technology and quantum information science through the emergent phenomena these materials harbor, applicable for spintronics, dissipationless electronics and quantum computing. <br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's educational activities aimed at training undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral research associate in computational materials science. This training is expected to offer the students and postdoc an excellent opportunity to acquire knowledge in advanced electronic structure methods, state-of-the-art materials modeling techniques, and high-performance computing, which are essential for their future employment in academia or industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The structural scaffold of a blood clot is a mesh of fibers, composed of a biomaterial called fibrin. These fibers trap blood cells and other blood components during the clotting process. When wound healing is complete, the fibers must be digested by enzymes in the blood in order to prevent significant risks from a blocked blood vessel such as strokes and heart attacks. During the digestion process, flowing blood and blood cells subject the fibers to significant tension. However, it is not well understood how these forces on fibrin impact the digestion process. The aim of this research is to test several hypotheses about how tension could regulate the breakdown of blood clots. Results from this research will yield a deeper understanding of the causes that lead to increased risk of strokes and/or heart attacks due to improper blood clot digestion, providing avenues for improved national health. In addition, studying the blood clotting and breakdown processes involves collaborative research in biochemistry, medicine, engineering, mathematics, and physics, thus providing a robust training atmosphere for student researchers. This project will support a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate researchers at three different institutions, providing them with a multidisciplinary training environment. Moreover, the lead investigators will develop curricular materials to teach principles about tension and blood clot digestion to elementary school students using LEGO during a 1-week STEM summer camp.  <br/><br/>During blood clot formation, fibrin polymerizes into a 3-dimensional gel wherein the fibers have inherent tension. After polymerization, clots are subject to applied tension, which originates from numerous sources including platelet contraction and blood hemodynamics. The fibrin network must withstand vascular forces during wound healing but then, to avoid blood vessel occlusion, must be dissolved through a process called fibrinolysis. A key knowledge gap lies in understanding the extent to which, and the mechanisms by which, inherent and applied tension regulate the fibrinolytic process. This project extends initial findings that inherent tension accelerates lysis while applied tension hinders lysis to perform the first multiscale study correlating amounts of fiber and clot tension with fibrinolytic rates. Each aim of this project centers on testing one hypothesized mechanism of how tension affects lysis: 1) causing structural rearrangements in the gel prior to lysis, shrinking the volume and expelling lytic enzymes; 2) altering the binding kinetics of enzymes to fibrin; and 3) causing structural rearrangements within the fibers and network structure during lysis, thereby clearing the fibrin more rapidly from the clot volume. Each hypothesis will be tested using a multidisciplinary research approach across three different institutions involving tensile testing, time-resolved microscopy, and mathematical modeling. This work will result in a combinatorial multiscale mathematical and experimental model that can predict lytic outcomes as a function of mechanical forces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such systems are integral to a myriad of emerging quantum technological applications: from building single-photon devices and storing and transmitting quantum information over long distances, to facilitating precision tests of fundamental physics. Thus, with growing efforts to miniaturize quantum systems, both with the fundamental motivation to explore quantum phenomena at nanoscales and also with the practical goal of developing modular on-chip architectures, atom-surface interactions at nanoscales become a central facet of developing novel quantum systems. However, when interfacing atoms at nanoscales from photonic structures, the ever-present quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field critically limit the ability to trap and control atoms. This work will develop ways to engineer such quantum fluctuation phenomena ? forces, dissipation and decoherence ? by leveraging the collective behavior of atomic systems and the ability to manipulate atoms with lasers. Overcoming these critical challenges in the design of nanoscale quantum systems will enable novel functionalities for quantum devices. In addition to the research goals, the PI will train a diverse undergraduate and graduate student workforce at the exciting intersection of Quantum Science and Engineering. As a part of the educational efforts, the PI will develop a multidisciplinary senior level course on Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, engaging students from a diverse array of Science and Engineering majors.<br/> <br/>This research will build a driven-dissipative Open Quantum Systems approach to engineering quantum fluctuation phenomena ?

The product will allow air-sensitive samples to be loaded into a SEM without exposing samples to atmospheric oxygen. Air-free analysis of reactive materials is required to engineer materials such as batteries and some microelectronics. The development of a low-cost, air-free sample transfer system will reduce costs for companies studying air-sensitive materials, improve the time to results, and help enable research advances critical for technology infrastructure.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a directly attached glove box which mates to the vacuum chamber of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). This innovation consists of a transparent, air-tight dome with gloves for sample manipulation. The dome is fitted with inlet valves for introducing a gas (such as argon) that creates the desired oxygen-free atmosphere inside the dome. A Bluetooth connected oxygen and water sensor is utilized inside the dome, so the user knows when it is safe to unpackage the air-reactive sample and transfer it into the SEM for analysis. During tests of the air-free transfer system prototype, it was shown that no measurable oxidation occurred on the outer surfaces of lithium metal when being shuttled in and out of the scanning electron microscope.

Damage by energetic particles degrades the sensitivity of ultraviolet photodetectors in harsh radiation environments. This project will study techniques for recovery of photodetectors based on gallium nitride (GaN). This aim will be achieved by electrical tailoring of GaN fundamental properties, the electron lifetime and diffusion length, by in-situ charge injection under applied voltage. Photodetector sensitivity will recover completely and return to the original state prior to irradiation. The project will advance the fundamental understanding of the nature of point and extended defects in GaN-based semiconductors and devices. The project will integrate research and education at the graduate and undergraduate levels and features an active industrial partner.<br/><br/>Technical: This project focuses on electrical mitigation of radiation-induced defects by charge injection into ultraviolet photodetectors based on gallium nitride (GaN). The ultimate aim is to produce radiation hard and efficient devices. The project hinges on the PI's previous findings that charge injection into p-type GaN leads to considerable changes in the material's fundamental electronic properties, particularly the carrier lifetime and diffusion length. These changes result in an order of magnitude enhancement of the photodetector response (quantum efficiency). It is therefore possible to improve performance of photodetectors, affected by radiation, using short pulses of solid-state forward-bias charge injection into GaN  p-i-n devices. The project will lead to a better understanding of the interaction between wide band gap semiconductors and highly energetic particles, including electrons, gamma-ray photons and protons, as well as of the nature of radiation-induced defects. Charge injection will result in enhanced minority electron diffusion length in the top p-type absorption layer of a photodetector, thus increasing the quantum efficiency for the device and ""healing"" the adverse impact of highly energetic particles. A unique combination of electrical and optical studies in the PI?s lab will shed light on the mechanism, which is responsible for the effect of interest. Studies of minority carrier lifetime and diffusion length will be carried out in independent experiments using ultrafast time-resolved cathodoluminescence and electron beam-induced current at various temperatures. Polychromatic continuous-wave cathodoluminescence will be employed for assessment of irradiation impact on threading dislocation density in GaN. Finally, the ultimate goal of this project is to correlate charge injection regimes (current; voltage; duration) and irradiation doses, thus proceeding towards control of photodetector performance and recovery from radiation damage by purely electrical means.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This year's symposium will highlight 16 senior invited speakers, 7 junior invited speakers, and a poster session for other junior participants, hosting a total of around 70 participants. The first major goal is to bring leading experts on stochastic processes with weak dependence and stochastic models in mathematical physics to Cincinnati; they will present their latest results. Several invited speakers are from Europe and Asia, and their presence will be much appreciated by junior probabilists in the midwest. The second major goal is to provide graduate students and postdocs in probability a platform to present their own results and establish connections with well-established scholars. All non-speaking and junior participants are encouraged to present their research results in the poster session. Last but not least, the organizing committee is committed to diversity and will ensure that conference attendees reflect the populations of graduate students and new researchers who form the primary audience of the conference.<br/><br/>The two main themes of the symposium are stochastic processes with weak dependence and stochastic models in mathematical physics. Stochastic processes with weak dependence have a long history in the development of probability theory and its applications, particularly in statistics. Recently several key techniques have found new applications in other mathematical areas, including random fields, random matrices, and random walks on groups. Such extensions will also be showcased by the talks of invited speakers. Mathematical physics has been another source of main motivations for the development of probability theory, and invited speakers will present latest results on selected models from random motions in random media and integrable probability.

However, they are less effective at learning the forms of knowledge that we as humans might communicate in language to each other, such as the rules of a game, a food recipe, or the process of filling out your taxes. These forms of knowledge are symbolic, meaning that they can be represented as sentences in language, or, alternatively, as computer code. In this project the investigator will develop new AI methods for learning symbolic knowledge represented as computer code, combining ideas from statistics, large language models such as ChatGPT, and program synthesis (how to automatically generate computer software). The scientific impact of this research will be AI systems that learn more abstract forms of knowledge, from fewer examples, and which are more understandable to humans, because the systems will describe what they know in languages we can understand. This research will also involve student researchers, especially those from underrepresented groups. It will also inform new graduate and undergraduate classes, including the new Cornell undergraduate AI class, which serves around 150 students each semester.<br/> <br/>In more detail, this work addresses the problem of learning symbolic knowledge. Symbolic representations already form the cornerstone of automated planning, proof assistants, and other important applications, but the ability to learn symbolic knowledge is less mature compared to our ability to manually encode such knowledge. The work is organized around the observation that general-purpose programming languages like Python are very effective at representing certain kinds of symbolic knowledge, and also that pretrained neural language models are adept at generating such code. Based on these observations, the project adopts a framing that combines symbolic knowledge, Bayesian learning for uncertainty estimation, program synthesis, and neural language models for code generation and efficient probabilistic inference. The proposed work could ultimately benefit planning and model-based sequential decision-making, help us better understand human thinking and learning in computational terms, and take steps toward further automating software engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research introduces small quantities of active nanofillers and quantifies the potentially improved performance of these metals, which would allow them to survive and thrive in extreme corrosive environments, thus transforming the engineering practicality and reliability of these metals. The scientific understanding of additively manufactured metal nanocomposites could revolutionize 3D printing technologies and revitalize the manufacturing competitiveness of the United States. The research will expose graduate students and female/minority undergraduate students to cutting-edge research at the intersections of materials design, mechanics of materials, as well as multiscale experiments and computations.

The research exploits the reinforcing potential of boron nitride nanotubes as active fillers in additively manufactured aluminum nanocomposites via the formation of strong nanotube-metal oxide interfaces in corrosive environments. The complementary experiments and simulations will provide direct and quantitative multiscale understanding of the hypothesized self-strengthening mechanism for these nanotube-metal nanocomposites fabricated by laser additively manufactured techniques, and elucidate how the mechanical properties of these nanocomposites respond to environmental changes (temperature, moisture content, etc.). The nanomechanical experiments of pulling out individual nanotubes from the additively manufactured metal matrix to directly measure the interfacial strength properties allow quantification of the interaction between the resultant oxide layer along the tube-metal interface and the porous microstructures. In turn, the interfacial load transfer characteristics are quantified to account for bulk mechanical performance improvement of the additively manufactured metal nanocomposite. The multiscale experiments and computations will elucidate the complex interplay of metal passivation, local interfacial load transfer, and microstructural changes, which ultimately control the stiffness, strength, and toughness of the bulk additively manufactured composite in a corrosive environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many natural product chemicals with broad potential uses have been discovered through traditional bioprospecting methods. However, the Achilles heel for commercial development of products based on these discoveries is that many of the compounds are difficult, expensive, or impossible to produce at scale. Further, many potent biochemicals are not typically produced under laboratory conditions, and therefore remain concealed within their host genomes. By associating known and new commercially-relevant metabolites with the genes responsible for their synthesis, this platform will open new opportunities for accessing the powerful chemistry found in fungi through modern synthetic biology and genomics. <br/><br/>The proposed project will enable discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding bioactive metabolites from a large private collection of Ascomycetes. The mature platform will contain thousands of annotated genome sequences from this large group of relatively unstudied fungi that have high potential for producing new drugs and crop protection molecules, in addition to uncovering enzymes that can be applied to multiple industries. A set of specific targets encompassing anti-cancer molecules, insecticides, antibiotics, and novel enzymes will be used as validation guides on the route to fully developing the resources needed for novel discovery. The goals for this project are to fully annotate BGCs from 200 genomes selected from a diverse set of bioactive fungi, and design at least 15 heterologous expression constructs encoding verticillins, antimicrobials, and insecticidal compounds for a Phase 2 project.

However the latter only works well for certain use cases.  This project will enable the development of systems able to better support people not only talking at but also talking with speakers of different languages. Specifically, it will focus on the aspects of communication beyond words, including pitch and other prosodic features.  The ultimate outcome will be speech-to-speech translation systems that support deeper communication among people, both across national boundaries and within our language-diverse nation, empowering individuals and strengthening social cohesion. Further, by increasing knowledge of how prosody supports effective communication in dialog, this will ultimately enable language teachers and others to help people communicate better also when unaided by technology. In addition, better representations and methods for modeling prosody and the pragmatic aspects of language will enable artificial intelligence systems --- smart speakers, smartphones, smart cars, robots, and so on --- to better support their users, in more contexts and in more languages.<br/><br/>More technically, this project will address issues in prosody, as a major barrier to widening the utility of speech-to-speech translation.  Despite substantial research on prosody --- in speech technology, linguistics, and psycholinguistics --- the field lacks good models of how prosody works for pragmatic functions and knowledge of how it can most effectively be modeled. While prosody modeling is an active area of research, especially for speech synthesis, there are no generally useful computational models of prosody as it serves pragmatic functions. While accurately describing the prosody of various languages is also an active area of research, there are no quantitative models of how prosodic forms and functions map across languages. Accordingly, the aims of the proposed project are to advance knowledge of how prosody relates across languages and the ability to use machine learning to model this.  The driving goal will be the construction of models that take as input an utterance of one language and predict appropriate prosody for the translation in a second language, initially for Spanish and English. Supporting activities will include corpus development, development of ways to measure pragmatic fidelity, organizing a shared task, descriptive case studies of the two languages, and user studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal tool in addressing issues too intricate for conventional methods, thereby accelerating the integration of computer-aided decision-making. In high-stakes domains such as healthcare and national security, it is essential that AI systems exhibit not only efficacy but also transparency, ensuring their reasoning processes can be comprehended and audited by humans. The AI methodologies advanced in this project will enable the creation of computer systems that are not only effective and robust but also transparent. This effort will pave the way for a more reliable application of AI systems, bolstering their use in high-stakes environments with increased confidence. Additionally, the project generates an innovative teaching method to equip the next generation of computer scientists with the skills necessary to effectively develop AI systems.<br/><br/>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning is a specialized branch of AI concerned with computer systems capable of utilizing knowledge in a format that is human-readable, open to inspection and comprehension, and effectively used by computers. This project is centered on enhancing (i) Knowledge Representation languages and (ii) automated reasoning techniques for these languages. It aims to address the critical need for handling qualitative and quantitative data, key components in numerous real-world applications, while preserving the inherent human-readable characteristic of these systems, a critical factor for high-stakes applications. Existing methods have primarily concentrated on either employing high-level languages that are easily comprehensible to humans or on effectively managing quantitative data. This project aspires to bridge these two approaches by designing a methodology to develop systems that are both human-readable and effective in handling quantitative data. Furthermore, the project aims to enhance these systems with human-readable explanations, providing auditors with essential insights into the rationale behind the solutions generated by the computer systems. With those insights, auditors can ensure that provided solutions align with their values or expert expectations. The key to achieving this goal is to use a fully declarative language such as Answer Set Programming and enhance the solving capabilities of its tools with dedicated external solvers to deal with variables with large domains. Traditionally, this has been the goal of Constraint Answer Set Programming, where those dedicated external solvers are exposed as extensions to the language. To benefit from the solving performance of those extensions, application designers are required to rewrite part of the encoded knowledge using the dedicated extensions, thus obscuring the declarativeness achieved when using the original language.  This project aims to automatically connect the declarative language with the external solvers without requiring the use of dedicated extensions, thus enhancing solving performance without hindering declarativeness. To achieve this goal, the project will significantly advance the formal foundations of (Constraint) Answer Set Programming by developing grounding-independent characterizations of these languages and semantics-preserving translations that synergize the strengths of both approaches to overcome their individual limitations.  Additionally, the project is set to cultivate an innovative teaching methodology to equip the forthcoming generation of computer scientists with the skills necessary to effectively utilize this new synergy between Answer Set Programming and Constraint Answer Set Programming.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division Of Information & Intelligent Systems / Robust Intelligence (IIS/RI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research has demonstrated that bilingualism, exposure to and use of two languages, causes beneficial changes in the brain that can be seen across the lifespan, from infancy and into old age.  A bilingual person's two languages are always active, requiring a continual process of juggling to speak the intended language but also the ability to switch between languages at ease.  After a lifetime of engaging these processes older bilingual adults tend to be protected from some of the cognitive decline that marks both healthy and pathological aging. Older bilingual adults appear to preserve better cognitive function for longer than older monolingual adults. This project conducts a series of experiments that explore the reasons for this benefit of bilingualism. <br/><br/>The experiments are oriented around the finding that, while bilingualism appears to delay the onset of dementia symptoms, when bilinguals finally develop symptoms they are often not able to use their second language. Two explanations have been proposed to explain the loss of the second language.  The first explanation attributes the loss to a decline in inhibitory control, the process that controls the ability to switch between languages.  The second explanation involves a decline in the relationships between words and what they mean. This project tests these alternatives by comparing the performance on language tasks that engage these different processes.  Network analysis is used to measure how connected utterances from language production tasks are and data from word production tasks measure cognitive control and language regulation. This project develops a general protocol that will identify patterns of language and cognitive change with aging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, the high cost associated with nanomaterial manufacturing limits the use of nanofertilizers outside of research. Addressing this critical hurdle, the potential advantage of this innovation is the development of a new manufacturing platform for the production of low-cost nanofertilizers using green chemistry methods. This technology could make nanofertilizers accessible to domestic and global agriculture within the next 10 years. Overall, the broad applicability of nanofertilizers has the potential to enable high throughput manufacturing of crop-specific fertilizers. This approach could lead to mass-customization of fertilizer composition, tailored to an individual grower?s needs, to maximize efficiency using more sustainable farming practices. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of highly bioavailable nanoparticle-based fertilizers for increasing nutrient use efficiency and leverages a green chemistry approach for the scalable manufacturing of nanoparticle-based fertilizers. This innovative approach focuses on nanofertilizers, fertilizers composed of nanoparticles, which have shown potential in enhancing crop yields while significantly reducing the amount of raw material nutrient ingredients and waste. The efficacy of this innovation stems from the superior bioavailability of nanoparticles, which allows plants to uptake nutrients more efficiently than traditional fertilizers. Furthermore, nanofertilizers can be tailored through minor production chemistry changes, enabling specific benefits like crop selectivity in weed-rich areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, existing language models predominantly follow the auto-regressive paradigm, which trains models to predict the next word given the left-side context. Then, they generate sentences word-by-word, left-to-right. The simplicity of this paradigm is attractive but it has several limitations, including inefficiency in generation, lack of reliable control for human-machine collaboration, and more importantly, it significantly deviates from how humans interpret and compose sentences. The proposed research explores a fundamentally distinct paradigm of language modeling --- insertion-based models. Such models formulate the generation process as iteratively inserting words into an incomplete context, offering significantly more flexibility and controllability compared to the auto-regressive models. The insertion-based formulation better mimics human writing behaviors and thus provides a tool for computational linguistics and cognitive science to study the structure of languages. The controllability of the model will benefit communication researchers, content creators, and creative composers for applications such as creative content generation, tailored communication, and personalized user experiences. The research results will be integrated in teaching materials to disseminate generative artificial intelligence (AI) for K-12 and undergraduate. <br/><br/>This project aims to advance our understandings of the benefits and capability of insertion-based LMs. The proposed research will explore different generation orders supported by the flexibility of the insertion-based formulation, with the goal to discover optimal insertion orders guided by linguistic theories. Additionally, the project will introduce a novel model architecture for a variation of insertion-based LMs that incorporates deletion operations, enabling the models to rectify previous generation errors. This enhancement brings added flexibility and controllability to insertion-based LMs. Furthermore, an ambitious goal of this research is to investigate the scaling law and scale up the pretraining of insertion-based LMs. The success of these explorations has the potential to lead to a family of large language models that exhibit enhanced flexibility, controllability, and inference efficiency surpassing the auto-regressive LMs, resulting in benefits for a wide range of natural language generation and general NLP tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It utilizes the history of The Magic School Bus (MSB), one of the most successful informal science initiatives of the past forty years, to study the relationship between education reform, children's media, and public-private partnerships from the 1980s to the present. It compares how different media (books, TV series, video games, etc.) introduced children to scientific inquiry in formal and informal settings. The project will generate scholarly and popular articles, online media, a science education roundtable, a book, and the groundwork for a future feature-length documentary. <br/><br/>The research team members will use their different disciplinary skills and knowledge to combine archival research, oral history interviews, and media content analysis to address the following questions. Why and how did MSB take shape as an informal science innovation? How did MSB's scientific storytellers work together to pursue their goals? How did MSB use media-specific affordances to represent science? What were MSB's immediate and long-term impacts? In addressing these questions, the project will study the role of animation as a tool for representing scientific phenomena for children and as a medium for increasing participation of girls and minority children in STEM. It will also study the motivations, tensions, and impacts of public-private partnerships in science education; it will analyze how private companies, including Scholastic and Microsoft, collaborated with NSF and other government agencies in the dual pursuit of profit and scientific literacy.

However, the rapid expansion of AI comes with risks as the potential environmental-sustainability benefits are countered by the impacts from the computing of the AI solutions themselves; these include increased energy, materials, and water consumption due to substantial computing demands. Meanwhile, environmental sustainability is multi-dimensional and current challenges include climate change, water scarcity, and multiple threats to biodiversity. Recognizing this complexity, this project comprises a workshop focused on a holistic AI computing framework composed of two aspects: (1) assessing environmental impact globally, encompassing water, biodiversity, and climate (carbon emissions); and (2) examining both the positive and negative impacts of AI on these outcomes. Broader-impacts aspects of the the workshop include the further developing of research capacity through cross-institutional collaborations seeded among the participants as well as student training in environmentally-sustainable AI computing.<br/><br/>The workshop aims to empower participants to address the grand challenges in sustainable AI computing, including new metrics and models for sustainability, integrating sustainability as an optimization criterion, hardware architectural design for sustainability, and sustainability-aware software-systems design. As tackling these challenges necessitates a quantitative methodology for environmental impacts, discussions will focus on applying life-cycle assessment (LCA), with an emphasis on anticipatory LCA, to AI computing. Anticipatory LCA models earlier stage technologies, enhancing the ability to make modifications that benefit environmental sustainability.

Through the Track 2 ATE project, Pennsylvania College of Technology (Penn College), seeks to redesign its plastics/polymer technology program (PPT) to reach a broader population of potential and current technicians, including new graduates and incumbent workers. Through the project, this team aims to create new certificate, AAS, and AAS-to-BS program pathways that are predominantly asynchronous, online courses, paired with intensive summer and weekend hands-on labs. These pathways are likely to provide a low-barrier, rapid on-ramp opportunities that broaden access for new and incumbent workers to enter well-paying careers in polymer technology industries. Additionally, the project seeks to advance understanding about reaching populations that are currently underrepresented in plastics fields. Ultimately, this project has the potential for far-reaching applicability for other technical education institutions, with relevance for a wide range of employers in the plastics manufacturing sector.<br/><br/>The project has four primary objectives: (1) redesign the first year of the AAS program to establish two hybrid, asynchronous for-credit certificate programs; (2) recruit adult learners into the redesigned PPT AAS and certificate programs through outreach to local technical employers; (3) introduce at least 300 high school students to PPT educational and career pathways through classroom activities and dual enrollment programs; and (4) provide a PPT Educator Externship to support high school educators to integrate polymer technology topics into high school STEM classes. The project team also plans to investigate how to efficiently implement an asynchronous multi-pathway training program that engages a wide range of learners, including current high school students completing an early college program, new graduates interested in entering the field as technicians, and incumbent workers who seek to increase their skills. Project evaluation efforts seek to advance understanding about whether students who live outside of the College?s nearby region can meaningfully complete a PPT certificate with substantially reduced on-campus time, and how to give incumbent workers training that adds value for both the student and employer. Project findings are proposed to be shared with a wide range of stakeholders, including other ATE program grantees, technical colleges, institutions of higher education, and industry partners.

In many cases, one can assume that the light electrons adapt themselves instantly to the positions of the much heavier atomic nuclei as the molecule changes shape (the ?Born-Oppenheimer approximation?), but this is only approximately true.  The electrons, which exhibit both wave and particle aspects, can interfere with each other.  The resulting electron wavepackets can oscillate rapidly compared to the motion of the atomic nuclei.  Such ?electron coherences? are thought to be important in chemical and biological processes such as vision but have been difficult to study due to the extremely short timescales on which they evolve (a few attoseconds, where one attosecond = 0.000000000000000001 seconds).  This extremely fast electron motion will be affected by the comparatively slower motion of the atomic nuclei.   The PI and her research team will use state-of-the-art lasers and photon sources on the campus of the University of Central Florida to study the evolution of these electron coherences and their coupling to the underlying nuclear motions. Ultimately such studies may advance our ability to engineer reaction products and optimize energy harvesting.  This CAREER award supports undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who will be trained in the use of state-of-the-art laser systems and associated advanced spectroscopic techniques.

The effect of electron-nuclear coupling on the electronic-coherence properties, such as their lengths, strengths, and revivals, will be investigated. Femtosecond infrared/near-infrared lasers and attosecond XUV/x-ray table-top light sources will be used as the pump or the probe. Electronic coherences will be monitored through electron kinetic energy and abundance variations as a function of the pump-probe delay, using electron-ion spectroscopy of 3-dimensional momentum imaging and transient absorption spectroscopy. Simultaneous measurement of electrons and ions in the momentum space will be used to show the correlation between the evolution of electron dynamics and ion motion. This project will advance our understanding of charge dynamics and photoenergy transformation and transfer mechanisms in molecules and pave a path to photocontrol schemes for directing energy flows.

There has been a continued interest worldwide in generating and isolating examples of such transition metal complexes capable of these organic group transfers, with the goal of improving catalytic efficiency and selectivity for reactions of importance to renewable energy, chemical industry, and pharmaceutical development. However, such complexes are often difficult to isolate and characterize due to their very high reactivity. In this research, the Anderson group will address this challenge by designing and synthesizing a robust new ligand scaffold which will not engage in degradation, but which will still support highly reactive intermediates, thus facilitating the study of these highly reactive species. Dr. Anderson will institute an integrated plan to recruit and support talented scholars from underrepresented groups in the sciences. He will pursue efforts with outreach to local elementary schools on the south side of Chicago, as well as in providing research-based internships for high school students. He will also work to establish and sustain an undergraduate research program for first-generation college students. <br/><br/>Under this award, the Anderson group will build on their prior synthesis of a prototypical perfluoroalkyl ligand scaffold to develop a class of oxidatively robust ligand frameworks containing strongly donating carbenes that stabilize late-transition metal oxo complexes with pseudo-tetrahedral geometries.

Hartwig in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. In this program, Prof. Hartwig is developing and seeking to understand reactions that are initiated and controlled by catalysts (catalysts are chemical additives that help a reaction to occur or to proceed more rapidly) through transition-metal complexes that ultimately result in the formation of bonds to carbon atoms bearing fluorine. These studies are important because organic molecules containing fluorine are vital to materials, agricultural, and medicinal sciences. For example, over 30% of new pharmaceuticals and 25% of licensed herbicides contain fluorine. The proposed research will answer a series of questions about the impact of fluorine atoms on the metal-bound carbon atom and will assess several approaches to induce and control the reactivity of these fluoroalkyl complexes of transition metals, thereby enabling the discovery of new catalytic reactions that install fluorine-bearing carbon atoms into organic molecules. As part of the educational plan, the PI?s research team will visit K-12 classrooms to present lessons on catalysis, the PI will teach short-courses for those lacking formal training in organometallic catalysis, the PI will continue extensive mentorship of undergraduate students from Berkeley and from outside institutions who are seeking postgraduate degrees, and the PI will present seminars on catalysis to general audiences, predominantly in forums in which he reaches potential scientists of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Although a large fraction of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals contain fluorine, fluorinated molecules are largely limited to those derived from simple fluoroarenes, trifluoromethylarenes or trifluoroacetates. Methods to synthesize more diverse fluoroalkyl structures require new approaches including new methods aimed at inducing and controlling the reactivity of fluoroalkyl transition-metal complexes in catalytic reactions. The proposed research seeks to address this requirement by discovering and developing new couplings of fluorinated nucleophiles and electrophiles using complexes of palladium, nickel, and iridium. Included are enantioselective couplings of fluorinated nucleophiles and electrophiles and studies that promise to reveal the differences in structures and reactivities of fluoroallyl intermediates. While carrying out these fundamental studies, the Hartwig group will address several important challenges for the synthesis of fluorinated molecular targets including the development of fluoroalkylation reactions that utilize catalytic quantities of transition metals, the control of the configuration at fluorine-containing stereogenic centers, and the development of new reactions of aryl halides that lead to novel fluoroalkylarenes. Thus, this research will impact the synthesis of molecules that are important in materials science, medicinal chemistry, and agroscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through an interdisciplinary, student-focused educational approach that incorporates multimedia, research, and teamwork, the project seeks to nurture a future workforce in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Biomedical imaging is essential for rapid and precise clinical diagnoses, yet it struggles with achieving both deep tissue penetration and high spatial resolution. Traditional methods like MRI, CT, and ultrasound offer deep tissue screening but lack details at the cellular or organ levels, whereas optical bioimaging techniques provide high resolution at the organelle level but with limited penetration depth due to photon-tissue interactions. To address these challenges, this project introduces an innovative biophotonics approach by developing near-infrared (NIR) mechanochemical biophotonic transducers. These transducer molecules are designed to harness ultrasonic waves to trigger NIR chemiluminescence, merging the depth of ultrasound imaging with the high resolution of NIR imaging. This synergy aims to reveal molecular and sub-cellular structures in deep tissues facilitated by gas droplets to amplify imaging signals. With high-resolution, multicolored, and 3D imaging capability at unprecedented depths, this technology has the potential to enhance medical diagnostics and personalized treatments significantly. The project focuses on creating non-invasive imaging tools and pioneering new research avenues in ultrasound induced biophotonics. This advancement could facilitate affordable deep-tissue imaging techniques, significantly impacting clinical decision-making and patient care experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kinases are involved in the dysregulation of multiple cellular processes that drive the pathogenesis of various diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, and Alzheimer?s disease. Measuring kinase activities in the early stages of various kinase-driven diseases including cancers could improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Herein, kinase activity assays will be developed in an innovative, low-cost, high-sensitivity, and multiplexed format to improve kinase activity detection and quantification for cancer-related kinases. This approach offers a critically needed innovation that could overcome multiple barriers facing existing kinase assays and better arm scientists and clinicians to understand kinase function and for personalized treatment. The development of this assay has the potential to drive new discoveries and improve clinical care across many disease areas by enabling researchers and clinicians to detect kinase activities precisely. <br/><br/>The proposed project addresses the unmet need for sensitive, accurate, and cost-effective methods to quantify kinase activity in disease. Current kinase assay systems lack key features required for precise measurement of disease-related kinase activities. This Phase I project aims to develop a novel DNA-based kinase assay platform that enables multiplexed quantification of kinase activities with superior sensitivity and specificity compared to existing assays. DNA-based activity assays offer advantages, including cost-effectiveness, high multiplexing ability, and sensitivity. The assay is estimated to be 10- to 100-fold cheaper than current assays due to the low cost of DNA synthesis and multiplexing capability. Successful completion of Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing this DNA-based approach for measuring kinase activities in cancer cell lysates. Subsequent Phase II studies will validate the assay with clinical samples such as patient blood, urine, and tissues. Ultimately, this DNA-based kinase assay platform aims to enable highly sensitive kinase activity profiling that is currently unattainable. This will pave the way for assay-guided patient stratification and therapeutic development by overcoming the limitations of current kinase assays.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The lack of accessible accommodations creates roadblocks for BLV students in STEM education, leading many students to give up, even though they have equal potential as the general population for academic success. All web-based, non-decorative diagrams are required to include alternative (alt) text descriptions for use with screen readers. Current methods for making STEM visualizations accessible through alt text are not scalable or amenable for use with dynamic digital media. Visualizing STEM concepts through a linear string of text can be difficult for BLV students, because of the high cognitive load. Integrating an interactive method for querying specific information provides screen reader users a more personalized learning experience. This interactive system can be used by all students to make sense of STEM concepts, creating a use case where all users benefit from the inclusion of alt text. Commercialization will be from integration into existing learning platforms to meet accessibility requirements required of federally funded educational institutions.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will create an expandable system for generating detailed and standardized descriptions of STEM diagrams in interactive media. The goal is to provide real-time alt text generation for screen reader users (SRUs) and to create an inclusive and accessible communication method for all students in STEM courses. The alt text description engine provides a method for integrating visual information from STEM diagrams with large language models and the algorithms of current artificial intelligence (AI) platforms. The AI-driven learning assistant from this project guides SRUs in understanding complex alt text descriptions in a manner that best matches their skillsets and prior knowledge. The AI learning assistant also provides personalized contextual learning support for all users. The technical objectives include 1) Expanding the architecture to scale the alt text generation engine to other STEM subjects and readily integrate with AI platforms, 2) Implementing accessibility features to the suite of learning interactives, and 3) Developing a database of learning activities aligned to learning objectives. Usability studies with SRUs and instructors will guide iterative product development.

While offering numerous potential benefits, these advancements also introduce new challenges necessitating robust state estimation and topology identification tools to ensure secure and cost-effective operations. Unlike transmission system state estimation which has been extensively developed, distribution system state estimation and topology identification remain open research questions due to the complexity of heterogeneous uncertainties, frequent changes in network topology, and limited real-time measurements. Therefore, many approaches developed for transmission systems are unsuitable for distribution systems. To this end, this project aims to develop efficient numerical algorithms that rigorously quantify uncertainties and leverage prior information, enabling a more accurate understanding of smart distribution systems and supporting their secure and economic operations. Additionally, this project will offer abundant resources to educate and train the next-generation workforce in essential energy and mathematical concepts. Research outcomes will be integrated into both undergraduate and graduate courses, enriching students' understanding of interdisciplinary topics such as energy systems and Bayesian data analysis. Moreover, educational and research findings will be shared with the broader energy system community and the general public through various channels including conference presentations, journal publications, and public events, ensuring widespread dissemination and impact.<br/><br/>The PIs will utilize tools in Bayesian learning, optimization, and statistics to model and quantify uncertainties in measurements, state variables, and network topology within smart electricity distribution systems.

The aim of the series is to promote interaction between mathematicians inspired by problems arising in physics, and physicists searching for new mathematical tools. The meetings also serve as a unique forum for junior mathematicians from all over the United States to learn about cutting edge developments in Poisson geometry and to disseminate their own research results in the field.<br/><br/>Poisson geometry originated as the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. Its history began with classical work by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Lie, developing into a separate field in its own right around 1980 via the work of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein. Today, Poisson geometry influences and is influenced by many adjacent areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures. The theme of the 2024 conference is the immensely rich connection between Poisson geometry and representation theory, which dates back to the original works of Sophus Lie on the realization of continuous symmetry groups by canonical transformations. The conference talks will make exciting recent developments in this area more accessible to Poisson geometers and representation theorists in the United States.

In power electronics, semiconductors with larger bandgaps are important since they enable the miniaturization of transistors and diodes, thereby reducing the device?s resistance and improving efficiency. In addition, wide bandgap materials enable efficient, high-frequency operations, which may significantly reduce the size of passive circuit components, such as capacitors and inductors. This technology uses the wide bandgap material, Ga2O3, that may enable the creation of more compact, efficient, and high-performing power conversion circuits at a cost competitive with existing technologies. For the energy sector, the solution may improve efficiencies within the grid, allowing for more efficient green energy conversion and contributing to a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. For electric vehicles, the charging times may be reduced due to increased charging power realized through Ga2O3. In defense and aerospace, the miniaturization of directed-energy systems without compromising power may lead to more agile and longer-rage weapon systems. For drones and satellites, the reduction in size and weight due to Ga2O3-based components may increase capabilities and reduce launch costs.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) diodes and transistors. Gallium oxide is a new, ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor material. Its unique properties enable large electric fields, which may facilitate extreme device scaling. The bandgap of a semiconductor, which determines the energy required to free an electron enabling conduction, is critical in the field of power electronics (PE). By replacing silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC) diodes and transistors with Ga2O3 diodes and transistors, size, weight, and cost reductions may be realized while matching or improving performance metrics such as power and reliability. Within the Ga2O3 field, efficient, high-voltage switching has been demonstrated. Moreover, the availability of large-area, high-quality substrates on which Ga2O3 films can be grown enable low-defect, vertical devices to be realized. As such, vertical device topologies are of particular interest. Results have demonstrated diodes with the ability to block ~2.9 kV. Gallium oxide with its large bandgap of approximately 4.8 eV, combined with the availability of affordable, high-quality bulk substrates for film growth, is positioned as an innovative technical solution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, half of our planet's habitable land is already used for agriculture with little left for new farms. As such, food productivity must increase in order to grow more food within the land we have. Controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) offers a great potential solution ? in this type of indoor farming, plants grow in oxygenated, fertilizer-rich hydroponics rather than soil, allowing growers to optimize plant nutrition. Paired with the precise control of environmental conditions enabled by indoor cultivation, plants can exhibit enhanced productivity in hydroponic systems and can be cultivated at higher areal densities in vertical configurations. Further, agricultural digitization can help improve efficiency, resilience, and sustainability of commercial vertical farming by opening the door to implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) for automation, real-time monitoring and control, and exploitation of massive amounts of data, promising deeper fundamental understanding of both plant physiology and performance within an engineering context. In this project, AI4OPT-AG, established by Georgia Tech, will lead an exploratory multi-national research network with targeted institutions in Japan, Australia, and India to collaborate and accelerate innovations in digital agriculture and optimization, and bolster food security for our future.<br/><br/>High-fidelity digital-twin-based approaches to digitization, and further, in-silico optimization, remain nascent in agriculture and the life sciences more broadly. This cultivation modality presents a useful platform for the study of living, dynamic, cyber-physical systems, with the implementation of hydroponic rather than soil-based configurations enabling direct, near-instantaneous control of the plant growth environment. Two specific next-generation techniques, hyperspectral imaging and gas chromatography fingerprinting of plant signaling molecules, could unlock valuable fundamental insights into plant physiology, but generate massive datasets requiring efficient processing to generate actionable insights. Innovations in digital agriculture, particularly in the engineering and integration of artificial intelligence (AI), biofeedback, and robotics could accelerate both knowledge generation and technology development. The primary challenges associated with this approach arise from the massive quantity of data, and the heterogeneity in data modality, quality, resolution, frequency, and complexity. There is also an opportunity to hybridize modeling approaches beyond purely data-driven or first- principles- based approaches. Such a hybrid approach may improve capabilities beyond those of its individual components, with first principles based physiological models providing fundamental constraints, transparency, and a tether to ground truths, while data-driven approaches provide data augmentation, unparalleled fitting abilities, and efficient management of high dimensional data.

ZBLAN can unlock radical performance improvements for telecommunication products, fiber lasers, and remote sensors. However, commonplace manufacturing techniques cannot develop ZBLAN without light-scattering defects, rendering glass to applications but ineffective for many of the most important ones. Based on modern automation, robotics, and processing techniques, this project builds a path to manufacturing this fiber to limit the growth of light-scattering defects. Moreover, the manufacturing process is further enhanced when performed in space. Due to the exceptional characteristics of microgravity, it is possible to produce a ZBLAN product devoid of scattering defects, offering a transformational leap in optical transmission capabilities. After successful preliminary tests, this project will develop the necessary hardware to develop ZBLAN at scale, both on Earth and in microgravity. This project is expected to catalyze a high growth, high throughput, scalable and profitable in-space production process with meaningful societal impact.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an instrument capable of rapidly casting molten ZBLAN glass through minute-scale apertures, aiming to streamline manufacturing by eliminating bubbles and restricting defect growth. This project seeks to overcome the challenges historically hindering ZBLAN optical preform production. The approach will produce high-value products that can radically improve optical capabilities by identifying a method to create precise preform core dimensions. Currently, state-of-the-art manufacturing processes lack the accuracy and standardization required to meet ZBLAN's stringent tolerances. This project leverages extensive theoretical calculations to optimize the melting, casting, and annealing of ZBLAN, which is crucial for minimizing crystalline defects and maximizing transparency. By leveraging novel automation techniques, harnessing the unique properties of microgravity, and effectively managing heat loads, this project is pioneering the in-space manufacturing industry, as demonstrated by the company's recent ISS experiment where astronauts pulled ~10km of ZBLAN in space. The project will develop an automated ZBLAN manufacturing technology to enable scalable terrestrial and in-space ZBLAN production. It will allow the company to develop new optical products - starting with free-space mid-wave infrared optical links. This innovative approach is poised to pioneer in-space manufacturing and propel the development of high-value ZBLAN products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there are no existing technologies available to improve muscle weakness associated with dysarthric speech directly. With speech therapy alone, patients with moderate or severe dysarthria may see mild improvements using compensatory strategies but still suffer from impaired speech as oral-motor exercises used in therapy are typically unable to rebuild muscle tone or increase control over weak or paralyzed muscles. Additionally, augmentative and alternative communication devices (text-to-speech synthesizers, alphabet boards, etc.) exist to improve communication, but even when used consistently, do not restore natural speech, can be cumbersome to transport, and have functional limitations (e.g., for speaking over the phone). This technology, however, gives patients increased control over their facial and phonatory muscles and increased range-of-motion in their faces, leading to improved articulation and intelligibility of speech.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the motor thalamus brain region to enhance muscle activity and restore motor function. The solution uses existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved stimulation hardware, consisting of an electrode lead and implantable pulse generator to deliver DBS with novel stimulation settings and for the treatment of a new indication in the recovery of speech and swallowing function. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that DBS in the motor thalamus increases muscle activity in the face, arm, and hand of nonhuman primates. DBS of the motor thalamus during pilot testing allowed patients that had motor speech deficits stemming from traumatic brain injuries to generate clearer speech with improved articulation and intelligibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While progress has been made on resonant-beam based wireless charging, high-data-rate communication through the resonant-beam channel remains largely unexplored. The unique channel characteristics pose grand challenges due to the inherent nonlinearity of the lasing mechanism, and the large delay spread emerging from the oscillatory signaling operation. The project will pursue channel modelling and transceiver designs through both model-based and data-driven learning approaches and will also develop an experimental testbed for performance evaluation. Thanks to the promise of data communication through the ?wireless fiber? link, and the fact that there is no interference to and from coexisting radio devices, the technology developed in this project will find emerging ?killer applications? requiring high data rate and ultra-low-latency latency such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Advances from this project will contribute to smart homes, smart hospitals, and smart manufacturing, and will make a profound impact to the society. This project will educate undergraduate and graduate students, improve the participation of under-represented groups, and outreach to high school students.<br/><br/>The resonant beam channel is distinct from all channels investigated so far, including wireless infrared, visible light, radio channels including millimeter Wave and TeraHz. The transformative research is performed along three intertwined thrusts.  (i) Self-driven nonlinear and time-varying Volterra series along with (multi-) kernel generalizations will be explored for nonlinear channel modelling and learning, for both the downlink and the uplink between the access point and the user equipment or sensors;  (ii) Transceiver designs will start with legacy waveforms on-off-keying (OOK) and orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) for resilience to the nonlinearity and large-delay spread of the resonant beam channel.  Novel end-to-end signal designs will be further investigated through artificial-intelligence (AI) tools; and (iii) Distinct optical designs with the inclusion of an adaptive optical element such as a spatial light modulator (SLM) will be pursued, which allows the system to scale to multiple users/clients, compensate for environmental disturbances, and support information transfer.  Experimental data will be collected to support algorithm design, and performance validation. Investigation of this uncharted territory will leverage interdisciplinary approaches at the confluence of optical engineering, wireless communications, signal processing, and statistical learning.

Previous experiments fissioned natural uranium without enrichment, thereby removing nuclear proliferation as one of the roadblocks to the use of nuclear power.  The hybrid sub-critical reactor has no chain reaction and can't run away. The hybrid is cooled with helium gas which can't become radioactive.  Without cooling water, a large pressure dome isn't required reducing plant cost and site size.  The hybrid produces fusion neutrons without large lasers or enormous magnets while keeping its fuel at a billion times the fuel density of tokamaks.  The fast fusion neutrons will fission thorium and spent reactor fuel.  A good business case comes from being paid twice to fission existing nuclear waste while generating electricity.  Hybrid fuel rods can be installed in existing reactors to ""burn"" nuclear waste on-site while reducing the time between refueling cycles. The hybrid reactor makes the best use of fusion's fast neutrons and fission's high energy density without the complications of either.  A new, safer, cleaner nuclear technology can reduce carbon emissions and present environmental advantages.<br/><br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to characterize the Lattice Confinement Fusion-Fast Fission of depleted uranium through time-resolved neutron spectroscopy.  Lattice Confinement Fusion holds deuterium fuel in a metal lattice as an electron-screened, cold plasma at a billion times the plasma density of a tokamak.  Extended Electrodynamics may provide insight into the fusion driver. Earlier experiments measured the fast fission of deuterium-loaded natural uranium and thorium by high-resolution gamma (HPGe) spectroscopy, alpha/beta scintillator spectroscopy, and solid-state nuclear track detectors. Neutron energies were calculated to average 6.4 MeV.  Phase I will use these diagnostics and measure the fast neutron spectrum with multiple neutron scintillator spectrometers with 500 MHz sampling rates and 200 keV energy resolution from 300 keV to 20 MeV.  We expect to observe the 2.45 MeV Deuterium Deuterium (DD), 14.1 MeV Deuterium Tritium (DT) fusion neutrons and conventional neutron fission spectra peaking at 1 MeV, averaging 2 MeV with a Maxwellian tail past 10 MeV. Phase I control, and active experiments will be shielded against cosmogenic neutrons. Four sets of ten-day runs are planned with four simultaneous micro-reactors per run.  The neutron flux, drive currents, and voltages will determine the scaling efficacy of a fusion-fast-fission sub-critical hybrid reactor technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The effect of roughness is very challenging to simulate rigorously because the geometry and the nearby velocity field has to be reproduced with a very fine resolution, which is computationally expensive. For some applications, including wind energy, pollution dispersion, canopy flows in urban areas, the ground region is a minor, but unfortunately necessary and costly, component of the simulation. The standard approach is to bypass the complexity of the roughness layer and assume that the logarithmic mean velocity profile extends all the way to the surface, thus losing some of the variability of the near surface velocity field. A more active wall modeling strategy could be envisioned. Recently, the evolution and derivation of the logarithmic mean velocity profile, has been connected to the vertical distribution of Uniform Momentum Zones. These are large flow regions that tend to move coherently with the same velocity, tend to get thicker with the distance from the wall, and are separated by thin regions of intense gradients. The Uniform Momentum Zones, and these internal shear layers separating them, are the simplest modeling framework for wall turbulence. The outreach component of the proposal includes a summer program for undergrad students from Native American Tribal College, international collaboration with a colleague in Australia, and experimental data sharing, open to everyone in the research community. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to formulate, and validate experimentally, a Uniform Momentum Zones-based stochastic model able to reproduce the velocity field, characteristic of near-surface turbulence, preserving its variability and dynamics, all the way to the ground.  To build and test this new model, experiments are needed, on different rough surfaces, to map the Uniform Momentum Zones distribution in three dimensions and guide the stochastic model. A new interface with large scale numerical simulations will be also implemented as a new, dynamic boundary condition. This will enable researchers to replace the computationally expensive, near-surface domain with an affordable synthetic velocity field, and improve future simulations of complex atmospheric flows, or similarly high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layers, like those developing around ships or planes. The ultimate goal is to enable and test the formulation of the stochastic model based on the surface roughness geometry and on easily measurable flow variables, to ensure predictive capabilities with minimal input information.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the Standard Model successfully describes a vast range of physical phenomena, it is known that it is not a complete theory.  Searches using high precision atomic, molecular and optical physics measurement techniques, such as the one enabled by this award, are one important avenue for constraining extensions of the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The PI plans to carry out science outreach at local Boston schools, to directly engage students and parents with compelling science demonstrations, create a network with local schools, and spread science opportunities. Next, the Fellow will become one of the main organizers of the event ?Bridging Talents and Opportunities?, which will attract high school students, parents, teachers, and sponsors to the host institution, MIT. The event is focused on connecting students with research opportunities, mentors, and funding; and exposing students to captivating outreach. Finally, two students per year will be offered summer research opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the speed of computer architecture simulations has not kept up with the rapid advancements in computing technology, particularly for systems that execute applications with large computations, large memory requirements, and large communication needs. This project introduces innovative lightweight simulation techniques that focus on efficiency by selectively simulating certain aspects of chip design or using higher levels of abstraction, drastically speeding up the simulation process. This project will enable the research community with techniques that support quicker development of new computing technologies. The research outcome will make the field of computer architecture more accessible to researchers with fewer resources. Moreover, the simulation techniques derived from this project will be integrated into the computer architecture curricula, helping students, especially under-resourced students, better understand concepts related to large-scale computing.<br/> <br/>Traditional computer architecture simulators recreate cycle-by-cycle details of the hardware execution, hindering fast simulation. To improve performance, this project introduces a novel suite of simulation tools designed to support the design and optimization of next-generation, large-scale computing systems. The approach encompasses three complementary strategies: behavior modeling, sampled simulations, and data-driven simulation. Behavior modeling abstracts hardware components to focus on essential performance metrics, enabling faster simulations without significant loss of accuracy. Sampled simulations leverage the repetitive nature of applications (with a special focus on GPU applications) to predict performance by simulating only critical segments of the workload. Data-driven simulations take advantage of statistical and performance modeling techniques to further advance simulation capabilities. These strategies will be unified under the Akita simulator framework, facilitating interoperability and ease of use across different simulation schemes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Software applications and workloads, especially within the domains of High-Performance Computing (HPC), Cloud computing, and large-scale Artificial Intelligence (AI) model training, exert considerable demand on computing resources, thus contributing significantly to the overall carbon footprint. Currently, the carbon emissions attributed to the software industry rival those of the aviation sector, and this trend is projected to escalate further by 2030. This project targets the creation of sustainable and environmentally friendly software by identifying and selectively restructuring energy-draining code segments (known as code smells) and addressing coding inefficiencies. This innovative approach has the potential to yield substantial savings in energy consumption, reduce carbon emissions, and make a significant contribution to the environment. The project encompasses a comprehensive education and outreach program, featuring science projects for K-12 students, the development of new undergraduate and graduate-level courses, mentoring of minority and underrepresented students, and the dissemination of the project outcomes to the wider society.<br/><br/>This project facilitates sustainable and low-carbon software development through three significant contributions: (1) a comprehensive analysis of code smells and investigation of the impact of their refactoring on application energy consumption and carbon footprint; (2) development of novel machine-learning models tailored to intelligently and judiciously guide code smell refactoring while prioritizing energy efficiency; and (3) application of the developed models across a diverse spectrum of HPC, Cloud and AI workloads, enabling robust validation and comprehensive evaluation. The research outcomes of this project will revolutionize energy optimization in software systems by offering a holistic framework that addresses the complex challenges of code smell refactoring and energy consumption.

One of the most consequential decisions is which of many potential mates they should choose for reproduction. Birds in species that typically form male-female social pairs for mating and joint care of their offspring also frequently mate outside of the social pair bond with nearby birds. The possible costs and benefits of such extra-pair reproduction are not well understood, nor is it clear how exactly animals choose these mates. Genetic and behavioral data will be collected in a well-studied wild population of house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) to test whether females choose to mate outside of their pair bond with neighboring males that will provide them with better genes for their offspring than their social mate. This project will further investigate whether females base their choice on certain male song characteristics and how females and other males react to more- and less-attractive songs. In addition to addressing topics of fundamental interest in biology, this research will lead to the development of critical but rare genomic information for a wild population with extraordinary long-term records and fitness data. An important focus of this project will be to provide training opportunities and research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students and to introduce high school students and the young and adult public to the process of scientific research. These initiatives will contribute to recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in science and will improve the scientific literacy of the public.<br/><br/>Males of socially monogamous species gain obvious fitness benefits through extra-pair reproduction, but the benefits are less obvious for females. Several possible explanations of female extra-pair reproduction can only be tested with detailed genetic pedigree records or genomic data that are still rarely available for wild populations with fitness records. Additionally, it is unclear how females choose which males to mate with outside of the pair bond. Many birds sing to attract mates and defend territories, but it is unclear which song characteristics determine the attractiveness of song to females because individual song components are often studied in isolation, rather than simultaneously as multi-component traits. This research will test if good-genes benefits provide an ultimate explanation for female extra-pair reproduction. The genetic data will also lay the foundation for testing additional explanations and many other questions in the future. Next, it will be investigated whether song serves as a proximate signal that females use to choose their extra-pair mates. This research will determine what makes songs of potential extra-pair mates attractive to females and then synthesize songs predicted to be attractive or unattractive according to a multivariate selection analysis. Playback experiments will verify the attractiveness of these songs to females and test how males react to attractive or unattractive song to identify suspected trade-offs between song characteristics that are attractive to females and song characteristics that elicit aggressive responses from male rivals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it has been challenging to extend its principles to describe hot tenuous plasmas that exist throughout the Universe, including the solar wind, the interstellar medium, and matter around black holes.  This project will use computer simulations and new mathematical methods to explore the statistical mechanics of turbulent plasmas.  The result will be an improved capability to predict the multiscale behavior of plasmas in astrophysical, space, and laboratory systems, including potential future fusion energy reactors.

It will involve the application of new theoretical approaches for quantifying irreversible energy dissipation in nonequilibrium systems. The team will perform and analyze kinetic and hybrid-kinetic simulations of plasma turbulence in different physical regimes, including relativistic and non-relativistic cases, to determine (1) the statistical distribution of entropy production rates in turbulence, and (2) whether turbulent energy dissipation leads to generalized maximum entropy states that can be modeled analytically. The outcome will be an improved understanding of turbulent energy dissipation in collisionless plasmas, leading to new models of nonthermal particle acceleration and subsequent radiation emission. The work has direct applications to a broad range of space and astrophysical systems, including the solar wind and black-hole accretion flows.

Address translation from virtual (a virtual memory address or a file logical address) to physical (a physical location on memory or storage) is critical to the performance of both PM memory system and PM storage system. The state-of-the-art address translations, however, negatively impact the overall system performance in cloud computing because they were originally designed for dynamic random access memories (DRAM) virtualization and traditional storage systems such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs). This project aims to fundamentally change how address translation is done in the cloud environments specifically beneficial to PM memory and PM storage. The idea is to bypass and short-circuit the lengthy translation process of traditional techniques by leveraging unique observations through extensive experiments. The success of this project has potential to advance next-generation cloud computing and contribute to educational activities by integrating research outcomes into new curriculum and teaching emerging cloud computing technologies to both college and K-12 students.<br/> <br/>This project introduces XLANE, a general, effective, and scalable address translation architecture for virtualized clouds with high efficiency. The goal is to fundamentally change the traditional address translation techniques while retaining full compatibility to the default designs. XLANE includes two techniques: direct memory translation (DMT) and direct file translation (DFT). DMT enables the reduction of the number of sequential memory accesses from 24 to two in each address translation for memory virtualization. DFT achieves the first direct file mapping design for virtualizing ultra-low latency storage devices like PM with efficient direct file translation. XLANE is a general approach that benefits not only PM systems but also compute express link (CXL)-based memory systems, tiered memory systems, and many others. This project will enable modern clouds and data centers to run emerging data-intensive applications (e.g., graph computing and artificial intelligence) on virtualized PM and CXL-based memory with exceptional performance and scalability, as well as low overhead and energy consumption.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Software and Hardware Foundation (SHF) core research program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These nanoribbons are exquisitely thin strips of graphene: a sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a rigid structure that resembles chicken wire.  Graphene nanoribbons have emerged as attractive organic materials for potential applications in high speed, lightweight, flexible electronic, and spintronic devices.  In this project, physical organic chemistry knowledge will be combined with advanced tools of transition metal catalysis to develop efficient strategies for making these interesting materials.  If successful, the research will address a long-standing challenge of preparing narrow zig-zag graphene nanoribbons for studying their physical, electronical, optical, and magnetic properties.  The research team will also be actively engaged in the Chicago Pre-College Science & Engineering Program (ChiS&E) to provide early chemistry education to Chicago public middle-school students, the Collegiate Scholars Program to teach high school students, and the Leadership Alliance Summer Research Early Identification Program (SR-EIP) to offer lab research experience to undergraduate students. Integration of the project with these outreach activities has the potential to greatly encourage diverse and students from underrepresented groups to explore careers in science and engineering while learning and actively contributing to research.<br/><br/>The research project will focus on the development of efficient and scalable synthetic approaches towards atomically precise and narrow N=3-5 zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs).  The preparation and fabrication in liquid phase of well-defined pristine zGNRs are very challenging and underdeveloped.  To overcome these unmet challenges, stepwise cyclodehydrogenation approaches to access zGNRs from their more stable oxidized or reduced precursor ribbons will be devised.  The novel monomer synthesis, on the other hand, will be explored using palladium/norbornene catalysis.  Compared to the existing approaches for GNR synthesis, the merits of the new strategies have the potential to be quite significant: (i) monomers will be prepared in a streamlined manner from commercially available starting materials; (ii) the syntheses will be scalable by using in solution polymerization; (iii) air sensitive intermediates will be circumvented, easing the material transfer process; (iv) aryl?aryl cleavage defects are to be minimized by avoiding labile m-xylene-type units.  The knowledge gained from this project has the potential to advance the understanding of these graphene-like quasi-one-dimensional polymers, which in turn will further stimulate the development of other new conjugated organic semiconducting materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposal addresses a pressing concern related to the contamination of water resources by medical waste, specifically gadolinium (Gd), a toxic element that is an important component of contrast agents used in magnetic resonance imaging. This research focuses on the analysis of river, stream, and groundwater of the Middle Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico to investigate the fate of anthropogenic Gadolinium in surface and subsurface water resources of understudied arid to semiarid areas and its impact on ecologocal and human health. The research involves field observations and sampling of river and groundwaters and laboratory experimental work. A focus will be to examine and trace the sources of Gd in natural waters and determine its distribution in the environment. The impact of Gadolinium, released to water treatment facilities and ultimately to the environment via the urine of those who have under gone MRI, will be studied and its impact on human health will be determined through exposure and toxicological studies of human digestive/gastric fluids. Broader impacts of the reserach include improved understanding the consequences of medical waste on water quality and public health. The work will provide much needed data for mitigation plans and serve the national interest in promoting environmental sustainability and public welfare. It will also engage local high school students, many from Native American tribes in the area, in water projects to foster interest and to increase understanding of water issues in a region already experiencing significant water stress.<br/><br/>The proposed research will address critical research questions regarding the fate, distribution, and toxicity of Gd contamination stemming from medical waste from contrast enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fluids containing the element Gadolinium (Gd), a toxic element to humans. In MRI fluids, Gd is chelated into a compound that renders it harmless to humans. However, this fluid is excreted from the body in urine, post imaging, and enters surface and groundwater systems through sewars and sweage treatment plants. Gd aqueous species are then released into the natural environment where they experience interactions with natural materials and processes that can change the speciation allowing it to become bioavailable. This resaerch provides a study of the Gd distribution and speciation in New Mexico Rio Grande Valley surface and ground waters and addresses analytical challenges of speciating natural samples with low-concentrations of Gd. It includes investigation into the effects of gastrointestinal fluids on speciation of Gadolinium and its toxicity. Key outcomes include (1) characterizing the concentrations and species of Gd in natural waters (surface water and groundwater) and sediments along the Rio Grande between Albuquerque and Elephant Butte, (2) an assessment of human exposure pathways and potential health risks associated with Gd ingestion through drinking water sources, and (3) improved understanding of the toxicological implications of Gd exposure focusing on the gastrointestinal tract and its effects on human health.

Adequate managing of risk is critical for a viable insurance industry. Most insurance, re-insurance, catastrophe modeling, and data services firms have concluded that climate risk poses unique challenges that are holding back this sector of the economy. Challenges include the non-linear and interconnected nature of climate risks, the uncertainty of global climate scenarios, and the paucity of critical actuarial data. As a result,  insurance markets are struggling to balance consumers? interests for access to affordable insurance against the insurers? need to remain solvent. The proposed formation of an industry-university cooperative research center (ICURC), the Center for Innovation in Risk-analysis for Climate Adaptation and Decision-making (CIRCAD), and funding of its full Center planning process, will address the need for more science-based research on the systemic challenges posed by climate risk the creation of novel new insurance strategies and products. The proposed Center consists of two university Sites (Duke University and the University of Georgia). It will engage a diverse collection of interested parties as Center members who represent the insurance sector and its value chain. Members of the Center pay a membership fee to join. This industry money is then used to fund university-faculty proposed projects that address the highest priority sector needs that are collectively determined by Center members. The proposed Center will undertake interdisciplinary, high-impact, pre-competitive research that seeks to both improve climate risk modeling as well as foster broader, sector-wide innovations in risk distribution and assessment that align with industry products and practices now impacted by the unpredictability brought on by climate change. Broader impacts of the work include providing solutions to ensure financial protection in times of crisis, as well as incentivizing societal risk reduction, safeguarding vulnerable communities, and catalyzing the development and deployment of climate solutions for other sectors of the economy that require synergistic risk signaling and management capabilities. Other broader impacts include recruiting, mentoring, and developing a diverse, highly-trained, climate-ready workforce.<br/><br/>The proposed Center for Innovation in Risk-analysis for Climate Adaptation and Decision-making (CIRCAD) will focus on tackling the present insurance crisis. It is motivated by developing creative and implementable solutions for the insurance industry whose losses are being driven by climate change. This will take place through cutting-edge research and cross-sector collaboration. It will also address regulatory issues and the need to create a climate-resilient society by overcoming a lack of balance in the industry which creates market inefficiencies in the form of obscured price signals and misaligned incentives which discourages public and private investment in climate-friendly projects. The proposed Center will focus on advancing insurance solutions at a systems level. Realization of the vision requires interdisciplinary, high-impact research that integrates data science and modeling, risk assessment and decision theory, and economics and policy. These element must be brought together to create and evaluate innovative and actionable climate risk management strategies, products, and practices. The proposed Center will consist of 25 or more faculty and senior researchers at Duke and the University of Georgia in the fields of engineering, climate science, public policy, decision science, economics, law, statistics, and computing. The faculty team is poised to engage with the insurance industry and other interested parties to develop a portfolio of sector, high-priority, high-impact projects. Anticipated intellectual advances include: identification of analytical and governance strategies for effective and equitable management of climate-related financial risk; improved understanding of subjective climate risk perceptions and their effect on risk management decisions; determination of the link between extreme heat and health outcomes; development of national-scale Bayesian probabilistic methods for multi-hazard characterization; and development of resilience metrics to inform planning, protection, and investment. Such advances will not only support the needs of the insurance sector, but, by disseminating the knowledge and tools produced by this research to communities, policymakers, and non-governmental organizations, will enhance climate decision-making and resilience on a national scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most bacteria are surrounded by a carbohydrate-based polymer called peptidoglycan. This polymer defines cell shape and withstands the outward facing osmotic pressure. The metabolism of peptidoglycan is a highly complex and coordinated process between synthetic and degradative processes. While understanding of peptidoglycan biosynthesis is relatively robust, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding the degradative steps and how they are coordinated with biosynthesis. To address the lack of chemical biology methods to study peptidoglycan degradation, this proposal looks to expand on the success of the N-acetylglucosaminidase inhibitor masarimycin in the Gram-positive organism Bacillus subtilis to develop an array of masarimycin-based chemical biology reagents for the microbial glycoscience community. This work could provide new insights into the role degradative enzymes such as N-acetylglucosaminidases play in cell growth and division. This research will be conducted with a significant number of undergraduate researchers.  As such, the  Reid laboratory will continuesto contribute to the training and development of the next generation of scientists. This support will allow for the Reid laboratory to contribute to the growth and development of the chemical life science ecosystem in Rhode Island.  <br/><br/>Most bacteria are surrounded by a peptidoglycan cell wall that defines their shape and withstands the outward facing osmotic pressure. Peptidoglycan metabolism is a highly complex and coordinated process between synthetic and degradative enzymes. While understanding of the biosynthetic steps is relatively robust, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding the degradative steps and how they are coordinated with biosynthesis. To address the lack of tools to study peptidoglycan metabolism and degradative enzymes in particular, the Reid Lab at Bryant University has developed the small molecule probe, masarimycin (Mas), to inhibit the major active N-acetylglucosaminidase LytG from Bacillus subtilis. Through this proposal, the Reid lab seeks to expand this work by developing new glycosyl triazole and diamide inhibitors of N-acetylglucosaminidases against representative Gram-negative, positive, and Mycolicibacteria. Masarimycin provides a vehicle through which to study the differences in peptidoglycan metabolism and regulation in rod- and coccoid-shaped bacteria. To achieve these goals, the Reid Lab will pursue three objectives in parallel. For the first objective, studies will build on their preliminary identification of GlcNAcase diamide inhibitors in B. subtilis and S. pneumoniae to create a second-generation masarimycin inhibitor with potentially improved potency and physical-chemical properties. For the second objective, preliminary glycosyl-triazole and diamide leads against Escherichia coli and Mycolicibacterium smegmatis will be evaluated to determine if these new inhibitors disrupt cell wall metabolism in Gram-negative and acid-fast bacteria in the same manner as in Gram-positive organisms. Finally, a comparative study between B. subtilis and S. pneumoniae will be performed, using masarimycin as a probe, to investigate the differences in PG metabolism between rod- and coccoid-shaped bacteria. The proposed work could open the door for masarimycin, and diamide inhibitors in general, to serve as valuable chemical biology reagents for studying PG metabolism across key bacterial genera.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Galapagos are experiencing a period of exceptionally strong warm ocean temperatures, related to the phenomenon known as El Nio that recurs every few years. In the past, such warm conditions have resulted in widespread death of corals, followed by the erosion of those skeletons by other marine animals. The skeletons of the corals themselves are valuable for climate research: the chemistry of the skeleton reflects the conditions under which the coral grew, and the corals have persisted for several decades. This project will sample and analyze these coral skeletons for climate history before erosion can damage them. The samples from modern corals will be compared with fossil coral records from the same region to better understand how the El Nio phenomenon is responding to the warming of the global climate. Broader impacts include field experience for a graduate student, support for undergraduate research, and collaborations with a local student and Park ranger at the Galpagos National Park and Charles Darwin Research Station.<br/><br/>This RAPID project supports coral sampling in the central Galpagos archipelago, where an ongoing strong El Nio event threatens the preservation of coral-based climate records that are critical to quantify past and ongoing changes in El Nio/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. Coral cores preserve quantitatively useful information about past climate variability in the geochemistry of their aragonite (CaCO3) skeletons. The Galpagos lie in the heart of the eastern equatorial Pacific where ENSO extremes create the largest sea surface temperature anomalies. The strong ENSO events of the late 20th century triggered massive coral mortality across the archipelago, e.g. >95% in 1982-3. The corals that have regrown over the past ~40 years contain valuable records of local sea surface temperature variability that are critically important to place paleoclimate records in context. These corals are likely to be stressed and degraded beyond the point of usefulness under the exceptionally warm conditions in Galpagos that has characterized the past several months (and is still ongoing). Previous work on Galapagos corals, both fossil and modern, documents unprecedented increases in ENSO intensity in the last 40 years, relative to the past millennium. Although the recent history of sea surface temperature from instrumental and satellite measures is known, modern coral records are needed to quantify the change over time and relate directly to fossil records. This project will also explore whether central Galapagos corals preserve a signal of ocean circulation ? the isotopically distinct Equatorial Undercurrent. If detectable in coral data, this signal would add an important dynamical component to the interpretation of past change in ENSO variability. Coral paleoclimate results from the central archipelago that postdate the 1982 El Nio have never been published. The project trains a mid-career graduate student in field methods and will bring samples into a lab where undergraduates will gain experience in sampling and analyzing them. Project results in the Galpagos will be disseminated through broad channels, including public talks and Spanish-language presentations at the Galpagos National Park.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project introduces innovative lightweight simulation techniques that focus on efficiency by selectively simulating certain aspects of chip design or using higher levels of abstraction, drastically speeding up the simulation process. This project will enable the research community with techniques that support quicker development of new computing technologies. The research outcome will make the field of computer architecture more accessible to researchers with fewer resources.

To improve performance, this project introduces a novel suite of simulation tools designed to support the design and optimization of next-generation, large-scale computing systems. The approach encompasses three complementary strategies: behavior modeling, sampled simulations, and data-driven simulation. Behavior modeling abstracts hardware components to focus on essential performance metrics, enabling faster simulations without significant loss of accuracy. Sampled simulations leverage the repetitive nature of applications (with a special focus on GPU applications) to predict performance by simulating only critical segments of the workload. Data-driven simulations take advantage of statistical and performance modeling techniques to further advance simulation capabilities.

Tooth enamel cannot naturally remineralize or repair itself once eroded or damaged, and current dental restorative treatments are invasive and remove a certain amount of healthy tooth structure. Contemporary dental restorative materials differ in composition and properties from enamel and dentin, failing to integrate into the tooth structure and leading to vulnerable interfaces that contribute to recurrent tooth decay and eventual tooth loss. Tooth decay prevalence in adults has been increasing in the United States, with 96% of individuals aged 50 to 64 experiencing tooth decay. Furthermore, about 60% of American children have had a tooth decay by the age of 5 and 46% of youth aged 2-19 years have tooth decay. Overall, the broad applicability of regenerative tooth enamel has the potential to significantly improve the dental health of all Americans by offering a minimally invasive, durable treatment for patients suffering from tooth disease. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology.

Prior research established the validity of the innovation through lab testing, demonstrating the technology?s ability to generate continuous enamel growth on both enamel and dentin surfaces, as well as integrate into existing tooth structures, even in the presence of bacteria. Distinguished by its non-invasive method of restoration, this technology has the potential to conserve healthy tooth structure, minimizing the needs for drillings, extractions, crowns, and root canal treatments, thus significantly preserving natural teeth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Employing the proposed AI and laser-assisted targeted noise control technology will enable the design and implementation of quieter and lighter metal structures. Studies have exhibited a direct correlation between weight reduction and CO2 emission. Statistics have revealed that for every 1 kg of steel used, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be emitted, and every 1 kg of aluminum used, 8.25 kg of CO2 will be released. In general, reducing 1% material weight in an automobile will decrease 1.25% CO2 emission. Our preliminary test results showed that using the proposed technology, sound transmission loss through a steel panel was increased, but its overall weight reduced by 38%. Therefore, this technology is not only cost-effective in mitigating noise issues, but also ideal for sustainability by simultaneously reducing structural weight and CO2 emissions.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is expected to produce a disruptive tool for engineers to perform targeted suppression of structure-borne sound radiation and transmission with higher precision, flexibility, and control than conventional sound characterization techniques. Specifically, the proposed technologies will enable engineers to see and determine: 1) where and how much acoustic energy is radiating from a complex vibrating machine; 2) where and how much sound is transmitting through a panel structure; and 3) where and how much to suppress acoustic radiation or sound transmission to meet noise mitigation requirements. Most importantly, it enables engineer to reveal the most critical components of structural vibrations that are responsible for sound radiation and uncover the root causes of noise issues. Accordingly, engineers will be able to enhance local stiffness, viscous damping, and mass without re-engineering the entire structure or increasing its weight. These targeted treatments can greatly shorten production cycle, cut production costs, enhance competitiveness, and increase profitability for U.S. manufacturing industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include anomaly detection using video streams, line-outage detection in power grids, onset detection of a pandemic, and detection of cyber-attacks. While traditional techniques assume that probability distributions for both before and after the change are known or can be found, this assumption is unrealistic in most scenarios of practical interest. As an alternative to such traditional change-detection approaches, this project considers the use of deep neural networks to effectuate change detection. However, rather than attempting to learn probability distributions directly, the project leverages the recently-demonstrated ability of deep neural networks to learn the ""score"" (i.e., the gradient of logarithm of the probability density) from the data and aims to develop score-based algorithms for change detection. These scores can be learned for a large class of high-dimensional data models using modern tools of artificial intelligence and rendering the developed algorithms applicable to a broad class of change-detection problems. Fundamental mathematical theories will be developed in the project to establish the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed methods, and the developed algorithms will be validated on several publicly available machine-learning and anomaly-detection datasets. Broader-impact aspects of the project include providing algorithms to the wider community for solving change- and anomaly-detection problems across multiple, disparate fields as well as activities centered on integrating research into graduate coursework and providing opportunities for underrepresented students to participate in the project.<br/>  <br/>The algorithms developed in the project will be based on the score of the data; this score can be explicitly derived for known unnormalized models or can be learned using score matching using an artificial neural network, and developed algorithms will be optimized to detect the changes with the minimum possible delay while avoiding false alarms. The project is divided into four technical thrusts. The first thrust will develop the fundamental theory for score-based quickest change detection for independent and identically distributed single-stream data under Bayesian, generalized Bayesian, and minimax problem formulations. While the performance of classical change-detection methods depends on the Kullback-Leibler distance between the distributions before and after the change, it will be established that the performance of the score-based methods depends on the Fisher distance between distributions. The second thrust will develop robust methods for detecting changes under modeling uncertainty, using the Fisher distance between the elements of the uncertainty classes. The third thrust will define the notion of scores for dependent data sequences and obtain optimal algorithms for detecting changes, with the scores in this case being based on the gradient of the logarithm of the conditional densities. The fourth and final thrust will develop algorithms for distributed change detection wherein multiple agents may have partial knowledge of the distributions and may only communicate with their neighbors in a geographical area.?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most common concerns faced by the stakeholders in the food animal market are diagnostic time and the cost of the tests, limiting the number and the frequency of tests that could be performed for regulation of animal health. A magnetic particle spectroscopy-based diagnostic platform can enable rapid detection of pathogen(s) at the farm.  Such pathogen detection is essential for the efficient implementation of control strategies that curtail disease outbreaks in animal production systems. In addition, the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single test, enabled by the new detection capabilities would further aid in reducing the time of intervention, effort, and cost of production for farmers dealing with these diseases. This assay can be readily modified for the detection of different diseases, enabling the platform to be utilized for the diagnosis of both human as well as animal diseases. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology.

As the biological matrices are non-magnetic / weakly diamagnetic, magnetic particle spectroscopy has an advantage over other commonly used optical or fluorescence-based detection methods in reducing the signal to noise ratio. Thus, the magnetic particle spectroscopy-based assay is highly accurate, and capable of delivering multiplexed test results. The diagnostic feasibility of this assay was tested using influenza A virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The portability of the detection device coupled with a smartphone interface will allow testing in remote areas and under field settings, such as on a farm or in a production system.

This yields significant consequences in quantum physics. The work sponsored by this grant lies in the framework of monoidal categories, which are categories that come equipped with a way of combining objects and combining maps between objects. Several projects are earmarked for partial work by undergraduate and graduate students. Moreover, the PI will make significant progress on completing a three-volume, user-friendly textbook series on quantum algebra. The PI is also an active mentor for numerous members of underrepresented groups, particularly for those in groups to which the PI belongs (women, African-Americans, and first generation college students).<br/><br/>The first research theme of the projects sponsored by this grant is on algebras in monoidal categories. The PI will extend classical properties of algebras over a field to the monoidal context, and will also study properties that only have significant meaning in the categorical setting. In addition, the PI will examine other algebraic structures (e.g., Frobenius algebras) in monoidal categories, especially those tied to Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). Another theme of the PI's sponsored research work is on representations of certain monoidal categories that play a crucial role in 2-dimensional Conformal Field Theory (2d-CFTs), and that correspond to 3d-TQFTs. Of particular interest are representations of modular tensor categories, and the PI's work here will build on recent joint work with R. Laugwitz and M. Yakimov that constructs canonical representations of braided monoidal categories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Very-low-orbit satellite capabilities have benefits such as higher resolution for images, weight reduction, and lower cost for payloads.  However, the current ion-engine technology requires a separate neutralizer to achieve thrust. The new technology uses an air-breathing plasma thruster that ionizes and neutralizes air particles and eliminates the need for a neutralizer. It utilizes air as a propellant, eliminating fuel tanks to reduce launch weight and costs while achieving zero carbon emissions and compact design, preventing space debris accumulation, and simplifying manufacturing.  Government and private space entities may be interested in applications of this technology for rapid response launches, reconnaissance missions, and potentially spaceplane-based transportation.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The technology is based on the development of an air breathing plasma thruster that operates in very-low-earth orbits below 200 km. Very-low-earth orbit is known as a self-cleaning orbit due to fast natural orbit decay. This engine utilizes air as a propellant, eliminating fuel tanks to reduce launch weight and costs with zero carbon emissions, compact design, and simplified manufacturing. Development involved a fusion of plasma physics, space propulsion, and plasma chemistry modeling to enable accurate theoretical predictions and experimental validation. Unlike other air-breathing technologies, the self-neutralizing, air breathing plasma thruster integrates a scramjet-type inlet, actively generating air plasma without compression, thus eliminating the need for a bulky collimator. Key breakthroughs include the development of a plasma density-generating circular arc electron source, capable of operation across various pressure ranges, with the material inside exhibiting self-healing properties over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Along with social and cultural shifts, it introduced contamination by toxic elements such as lead, arsenic, and cadmium into the environment. This doctoral dissertation project investigates the impacts of the toxic elements associated with the spread of intensified metallurgical production. Archaeology is particularly well suited to monitor the impacts of metallurgy, due to its ability to examine the short and long-term impacts of pollution through time. The project offers a new theoretical approach to study technological intensification which focuses on nuanced differences in the adoption and pursuit of intensification among contemporary communities. By examining contamination from metallurgical activity, the research contributes to broader questions of how societies perceive and respond to environmental degradation. The project provides research experience in both fieldwork and laboratory methods for students from different field of studies and promotes further discussion of environmental degradation in the past and present. The results of the research are presented in peer-reviewed journals, lectures, and domestic, international, and interdisciplinary conferences, and presented to the wider public through workshops, social media, podcasts, and websites.<br/><br/>The research evaluates the contrasting modalities of metallurgical production and intensification between different time periods. Using data from six archaeological sites, the research merges archaeological evidence of metallurgical activities with methods commonly used in public health and geo-medicine to track environmental contamination. Domestic and wild animal teeth and site sediments provide direct evidence of metallurgical production from settlements and their surroundings. The diachronic and interdisciplinary nature of the research makes it possible to track the nuanced social and environmental impacts of technological intensification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the last three decades every sector has experienced a digital transformation. Despite federal regulation requiring digital assets such as websites, kiosks, or mobile apps to be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), over 96% of the million most-visited websites are not ADA compliant. For the 17% of Americans with a disability the Internet is unusable. This innovation applies novel breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence to automatically identify and remediate ADA violations in digital assets. Thus, ensuring that any platform from healthcare to public transportation to voting platforms are universally accessible. Consider the implications: an elderly citizen with deteriorating vision can seamlessly navigate an online prescription platform; a veteran with motor disabilities can effortlessly book transportation to a voting center; a K-12 STEM student with auditory challenges can access vital educational information or public service announcements without impediments. Automation of accessibility testing, and remediation leads to significant cost savings for companies, governments, and small- to medium-sized businesses that want to access the $17 trillion of spending power that disabled Americans and their families hold.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project replaces the manual testing, manual remediation, manual training, and manual auditing that software engineers or consultants use to make digital assets compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The aim is to leverage artificial intelligence, computer vision, and novel production code reassociation techniques to accurately identify 65% of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) compliance issues, significantly higher than industry leaders, and provide solutions that are both context-aware and developer-friendly directly within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), something no industry-leader today does. The research will refine a novel approach which allows frontend software to be retraceable for automated testing and fixing at the source code level, enabling engineers to pinpoint exactly where an accessibility violation is located. Existing solutions completely lose track of the relationship between production software and the original source code that generated it. Instead, resorting to screenshots or inaccurate approximations to give developers context. The core technical innovation not only detects non-compliant elements, but also provides real-time contextual developer solutions in the immediate line of code or component where the error occurs.

This project will advance the understanding of the help-seeking landscape and how students from different backgrounds seek help in computing courses.<br/><br/>The project goals are to 1) characterize the help resource landscape available in computing courses; 2) understand students? behaviors and usage of help resources; and 3) evaluate an intervention to improve students? understanding and usage of help resources to empower them with valuable self-regulated learning skills to increase their learning.  The project will use a quantitative approach to describe the current help resource landscape in computing courses. Interviews with students will clarify their help-seeking patterns and their perceived learning effectiveness. The project will create best practices for help resources and equitable computing course design, including an intervention to 1) explicitly teach students about the help resource landscape, 2) guide them to identify what help they need, and 3) empower them to consciously utilize the landscape and their self-identified help needs to be more effective in their help-seeking. The NSF IUSE:EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the regional and global numerical models cannot fully resolve OSBL processes, simplified parameterization schemes are used to approximate them. Recent evidence suggests that discrepancies between different parameterizations and other errors may result from the limited and idealized representation of physics, such as the assumption that small-scale turbulence is uniform by direction (isotropy) and location (homogeneity). OSBL turbulence is anticipated to deviate from this idealized model due to the influences of shear, stratification, and waves. This project will provide the first direct observational study of anisotropy and inhomogeneity of OSBL turbulence with measurements from acoustic instruments that drift with the water flow. These custom instruments will have acoustic beams pointing horizontally, vertically, and diagonally to carry out direct and simultaneous observations of turbulence statistics in multiple directions, encompassing scales from centimeters to tens of meters, thereby resolving their anisotropy and inhomogeneity. The observations from this project will produce both an empirical insight and a comprehensive dataset that could be used for development, refinement, and benchmarking of simulations and turbulence closures. Thus, this project will contribute to the evolution of our capacity to forecast the dynamics of the Earth's system across scales ranging from local phenomena to the broader spectrum of global climate dynamics. Understanding the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of ocean turbulence will clarify the errors, biases, and limitations associated with various techniques used to characterize turbulence and lead to the development of corrections for existing observations and better future observational practices. This project will support a number of complementary Applied Physics Laboratory outreach efforts aimed at general broadening of public awareness and participation in science. It will provide dedicated line-item support for APL STEM Development Program Coordinator to develop ongoing and future outreach projects at APL, facilitate connections to local schools as well as undergraduate students attending UW, surrounding community colleges, and technical schools.<br/><br/><br/>This project will deploy two Lagrangian floats, each equipped with a pair of customized Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) providing a total of 10 acoustic Doppler beams on each float pointing horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. These beams, used in combinations, will gather multiple directional second- and third-order statistics of velocity fluctuations, thereby estimating how turbulence energy and energy flux is partitioned across scales and directions. The observations will be conducted in a turbulent tidal channel and at the Ocean Climate Station P site (North Pacific) providing a variety of forcing conditions. The primary impact of the project will be an enhanced understanding of the extent to which ocean boundary layer turbulence deviates from the idealized model of homogeneity and isotropy. A more comprehensive description of ocean turbulence will lead to a deeper understanding of the complex processes that drive and govern turbulence in the ocean. It will help clarify the mechanisms responsible for turbulence generation, dissipation, and energy transfer, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of oceanic flows. The project will specifically address a number of outstanding scientific questions, such as: What is the extent of the isotropic inertial subrange in OSBL turbulence? What is the magnitude and distribution of anisotropy? Can anisotropy be predicted and parameterized? How does anisotropy affect the measurements and parameterization of ocean turbulence?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the past two decades, mathematicians and educators have partnered to improve the quality of mathematics courses for teachers, particularly those offered in departments of mathematics. Many departments now recognize the importance of preparing teachers in the special ways that skillful teaching harnesses mathematics knowledge. Yet recent results suggest that despite overall successes in how well teachers teach and how well students learn, there is more that the mathematics teacher education community needs to do to challenge educational inequities. This conference will convene leaders in mathematics and education across levels. Conference participants will be asked to consider how mathematics courses and sequences can be transformed to develop teachers? knowledge of the mathematical sciences while also working toward equity. The conference will aim to support program transformation toward equity in the context of evolving mathematics curriculum from kindergarten through college.<br/><br/>The goals of the conference will be to: (1) Provide resources to stakeholders to transform the mathematical education of teachers so that teachers can reach more students from historically under-served communities; (2) Articulate principles for the roles of mathematics departments in designing mathematical work for teachers so their future students from historically under-served communities have more opportunity to flourish. To do so, the conference speakers and more than 50 stakeholders, including mathematicians and mathematics teacher educators, will contribute to proposed guidelines for collaborating across different groups to design mathematics courses and sequences of courses that work toward equity in the context of the mathematical education of teachers; and proposed principles and metrics for assessing mathematical and pedagogical practices used in mathematics courses and sequences with an eye on equity. These products will be novel in scope. They will represent a synthesis of expertise and experience across grade bands and stakeholders, and they will focus simultaneously on equity and knowledge in the mathematical sciences. Findings of this conference have the potential to shape updates of guiding documents for the mathematical education of teachers such as those published by the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences and the Mathematical Association of America?s Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics.

Today, buildings are equipped with PIR sensors for occupancy detection, owing to their low cost, low energy consumption, wide field of view, and high reliability. Despite these advantages, PIR sensors only detect motion, not stationary occupancy. This long-standing limitation has hindered applications that demand high-accuracy occupancy detection. If successful, the proposed semiconductor modulator will enable novel capabilities for standard PIR sensors, including stationary occupancy detection, human infrared signal differentiation, occupancy counting, activity identification, and classification - representing the first true technological innovation in PIR sensing in over 40 years.

The GLaMP meetings are typically held over 3 days in June, with an attendance of 45-50 researchers.  The annual conference series, which began in 2016 at Michigan State, focuses on early-career mathematicians working in mathematical physics.  Each meeting features invited talks by experts in the field, a minicourse on a topic in mathematical physics, contributed talks by participants, and an interactive career development panel. The main goals of the GLaMP series are: 1) to provide a forum for early-career researchers in mathematical physics ? including advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and early-career postdoctoral scholars ? to present their research and enhance their career development; 2) to maintain communication and collaboration among scientists working in mathematical physics throughout the United States and, in particular, in the greater Midwest; 3) to encourage participation by women and underrepresented minorities in the field of mathematical physics; and 4) to raise the research profile of mathematical physics within the mathematical and scientific community of the United States. All details about the 2024 meeting and links to web pages of previous GLaMP meetings can be found at https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp/home. <br/><br/><br/>Mathematical Physics is one of the oldest scientific disciplines and is a very active field worldwide, with researchers working in both mathematics and physics departments. The roots of the field can be traced to the classical mathematics of Newton, Euler, and Gauss.  In the twentieth century, there were many developments at the boundary between mathematics and physics, for example, in scattering theory, non-relativistic quantum mechanics, constructive quantum field theory, the foundations of statistical mechanics, and applications of geometry and topology to high energy physics. The field is supported by the International Association of Mathematical Physics, which organizes an international congress every three years. Although there are many mathematical physicists working in the United States, there are few regular conferences representing the field in the US. The GLaMP meetings have evolved to be the main annual meetings focused on mathematical physics in the US.  Minicourse topics have included non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics, disordered quantum spin chains and many-body localization, non-self-adjoint operators and quantum resonances, the mathematics of aperiodic order, random matrix theory and supersymmetry techniques, quantum trajectories, and mathematical general relativity. Besides the location, we believe that the distinguishing feature of the GLaMP meeting is its emphasis on early-career researchers. The majority of contributed talks are given by early-career faculty, postdocs, and advanced graduate students. In addition to providing a forum that showcases the work of young researchers, the GLaMP meeting also offers career development opportunities, specifically through a three-hour mini-course on an active area of research given by a world-class expert and a career round table with panelists representing different career paths in mathematical physics, both in academia and in industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This workshop will focus on applications of the optimal transport problem, a mathematical problem where the goal is to minimize the total cost of transporting mass from one location to another, to problems involving physical processes that change with time. Such processes include interface motion (such as how water spreads on a surface), models for tumor growth, modeling fluid flows, multi-species population dynamics, and reconstruction of the state of the early universe. The workshop will provide a unique opportunity for early-career researchers to develop connections with and be exposed to the cutting-edge research of well-established leaders in the field. Additionally, the workshop will establish connections between mathematicians and cosmologists, to further accelerate development of the tools and theory behind computation in early universe reconstruction.  More information on the workshop may be found at https://www.birs.ca/events/2024/5-day-workshops/24w5198.<br/> <br/> <br/>The workshop will bring together experts working in optimal transport (Monge-Kantorovich) theory with connections to dynamics interpreted in a broad sense. This includes using optimal transport and related tools to analyze and model fluid flows, interface motion in evolutionary PDE, and also the use of dynamical techniques such as the theory of the parabolic Monge-Ampre PDE for computational and theoretical analysis of optimal transport itself. Optimal transport theory has also been used as a computational model for early universe reconstruction that is consistent with the Zel?dovich approximation, by cosmologists with great success. With recent developments in cosmological surveying and the availability of new data, this area is currently experiencing a revival and is a particularly timely topic. The workshop will consist of a combination of short and long talks solicited from participants, with priority given to presentations by early-career researchers (i.e., graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and pre-tenure faculty).

In addition to the strong hail impact on personal and business property, the agricultural and renewable energy sectors also suffer. Advanced polarimetric weather radars are the best instruments to remotely detect hail in the clouds, estimate its size, and produce timely warnings of impending hail if guided by the physical cloud models that predict hail growth and its fallout on the surface. However, existing methodologies for quantifying and forecasting large hail have serious limitations which will be mitigated as a result of the project. This project will capitalize on the unique observations of hail from the armored T-28 research aircraft that penetrated hail-bearing storms during multiple field campaigns in the past. Combining direct hail measurements within the cloud aloft and at the surface with cloud modeling describing its evolution on the way to the ground and the collocated polarimetric radar observations within the full depth of the storm will help to better understand the microphysical processes of hail generation and develop more advanced methodologies for its quantification and prediction / nowcasting.<br/><br/>The technical approach will involve utilization of the documented measurements of sizes, number concentrations, and shapes of hailstones aloft to initialize the cloud model. The model involves spectral bin microphysics describing the evolution of hailstones including the change of hail size and kinetic energy with height within the storm as they fall to the surface.  The output of the cloud model will be converted into the vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables which will be compared to the associated measured profiles. This will allow to retrieve size distribution of hail above the melting layer using vertical profiles of radar variables associated with melting hail within the melting layer and beneath and will serve as an observational reference for cloud models? evaluation and optimization.  Novel polarimetric radar predictors in deep convective updrafts signifying large or giant hail at the surface will be identified and explored across a wide range of thermodynamic and climatological regimes and height of the surface relative to sea level using polarimetric radar data collected by the operational WSR-88D radars in a multitude of particularly devastating hailstorms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For many of these people, managing what has happened to them and moving forward with their lives requires extensive coping efforts. However, a subset will struggle to cope, and some will experience serious mental health problems.  Surprisingly, very little is known about how this initial coping process unfolds and what predicts who will do well and who will struggle. This project tests a theory of the key biological, psychological, and social markers of effective versus ineffective coping in the early stages of traumatic injury recovery. Gaining this insight is vital to the development of future real-time interventions. Results of the research offer other societal benefits that inform healthcare policy, trauma support and disaster response, and understanding how survivors recover from other major traumas including sexual assault, war, and disasters.<br/><br/>This project breaks new scientific ground by developing and extending theory that accounts for coping dynamics following traumatic injury recovery. It focuses on Self-Regulation Shift Theory, which uses a dynamical systems framework to account for nonlinear shifts in psychological functioning. One aim is to critically test hypothesized tipping points for both adaptive and maladaptive copying dynamics. A second aim is to evaluate the possibility of detecting early warning signals for impending shifts in functioning. A final aim is to evaluate the frequency and timing of nonlinear shifts within identified recovery trajectories. The research follows 300 injury survivors using innovative multi-source data collection, including biosensor, self-report survey, daily electronic diary, and audio self-report data. Using novel methods and advanced nonlinear analytic techniques, this project advances basic knowledge of acute trauma adaptation and advances current theoretical models of traumatic stress recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to shift academic cultures in ways that can support these efforts by developing a learning ecosystem that engages early career scientists (Pathmakers) and community members in a phased curriculum that 1) offers a virtual discussion series to have broad impact for a large number of participants, 2) offers immersive institutes for early career scientists to participate in person and in community for training around ethical and equitable best practices, 3) provides support both financially and through mentoring for these new leaders to carry out co-produced research in equitable exchange working groups, 4) connects Changemakers from administrative leadership roles in an innovation incubator to pursue broad policy change and 5) cultivates a community of practice for participants to grow and communally learn from one another.<br/><br/>There is a documented tendency in the sciences to discount the experiences, knowledges, perspectives and priorities of non-dominant communities.

The overall objective is to protect public health through enhanced understanding of how climate and oceanic processes affect the intensity and distribution of toxin-producing HABs and to understand the potential health risks from exposure even to low levels of their potent neurotoxins, especially during susceptible stages of life. Three distinct research projects will explore environmental controls of bloom occurrence, create numerical models to predict the exposure of human population to toxins under changing climate conditions, and study the effects of HAB toxins on the brain. The administrative core of the Center will connect these projects, encouraging open discussion of planning, integration, communication and enhancing diverse perspectives, and providing rigorous evaluation of progress in all aspects of the program. The Center?s Community Engagement Core will facilitate integration of the research with education and engagement of resource managers and other stakeholders. The Center will improve awareness of emerging HAB issues for the public health community and develop new educational materials and interactive activities for K-12 classrooms, and for health care providers. The Center is jointly supported by NSF?s Division of Ocean Sciences and by the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).<br/><br/>The Center will focus on two key HAB taxa: Alexandrium catenella, which produces the saxitoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), and Pseudo-nitzschia spp., which produce domoic acid responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) syndrome; both are expanding geographically. Novel, targeted, efficient, and data-rich sampling approaches developed by the applicants and applied in situ in natural settings have revealed new controls of A. catenella population dynamics, and have identified possible new climate links regarding toxic Pseudo-nitzschia species. Project 1 will examine further the physiological and climatic variables affecting these HABs, which may underlie population adaptation in different habitats and different environmental regimes. Project 2 will incorporate these new and fundamental insights on bloom regulation into coupled climate-population models to predict HAB threats under future climate scenarios, a key step toward being able to quantify future risks from this recurrent public health threat. In biomedical studies with the zebrafish model, Project 3 has identified myelination in the developing brain as a target of domoic acid. This project will use transgenic zebrafish and single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the cell-specific mechanisms underlying effects of domoic acid, saxitoxin, and the cyanotoxin anatoxin-a in zebrafish embryos in vivo and will use human iPSC-derived 3D brain systems in vitro to elucidate toxin effects on neural and glial cell differentiation in human cells. Effects of different HAB toxin co-exposures will be examined in early life stages and adults. Through this multidisciplinary collaborative and integrated approach, all three projects will link oceanic processes to human exposure, helping to define the exposure of susceptible human subpopulations and predict the effects of a changing climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Every experiment, every analysis, every collaboration entails embarking on a path whose destination is uncertain and whose terminus could be a dead end. Yet, not all projects are equally risky. In choosing what to work on, scientists have the latitude to embrace or avoid.  Appropriately high risk can bring high return, while excessive caution hampers scientific progress.  Thus, scientists and the public alike have an interest in encouraging researchers to pursue suitably risky projects, yet investigators often shy away from taking the big risks that may generate the most productive science. This project unpacks the incentives that investigators face when choosing how much risk to take on in their scientific careers.  The project illuminates why researchers may shy away from the most promising but risky ideas, and asks how scientific norms and institutions can be modified to motivate researchers to pursue the most promising ideas while still protecting their livelihoods from the vicissitudes of scientific chance.  This understanding can help accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, enhancing the public?s return on its investment in scientific research.<br/><br/>The researchers develop, analyze, and communicate mathematical models of how scientists balance the competing incentives and constraints that they face when constructing and pursuing their research programs.  These models apply the tools of economics and decision theory to the practice of scientific research, and blaze new ground by focusing specifically on scientists? risk-taking and its consequences for scientific debate and the formation of scientific consensus.  One component of the research examines how scientists? tradition of preferentially publishing successful projects encourages or discourages risk-taking, and how alternative models for scientific publication might shift scientists? tolerance for risk.  A second component builds on recent mathematical developments in the theory of imprecise probability to develop a more expansive view of how scientists navigate the thick uncertainty that defines work at the scientific frontier.  The researchers engage closely with funders, research administrators, journal editors and publishers, and other stakeholders to direct the research and share its outcomes, ensuring that the discoveries that the research yields are used to promote high-risk, high-return science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These group decisions range from high stakes, e.g., who should receive a kidney; to low stakes, e.g., where should we go to dinner? In all these settings and applications, each agent arrives with their own preferences, and a mechanism (algorithm) makes a decision that is then shared by that group. This research focuses on improving mechanisms and processes for two classic settings: selection problems (e.g. voting), where a single or small set of winners must be shared by the group, and allocation problems (e.g., matching), where each agent receives a personal allocation or bundle. This research will leverage the fact that since computers mediate much of the communication between agents, large amounts of data are available to analyze, understand, and improve the decision-making process. Hence, there is a unique opportunity to  study group decision making in the complex, realistic contexts in which it takes place by leveraging human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) principles that prioritize human needs and values.<br/><br/>The formal study and application of models, algorithms, and axioms for collective decision-making are fundamental to many areas, including computational social choice, electronic commerce, and recommender systems. This award will advance techniques from human-centered artificial intelligence and computational social choice (HCAI-COMSOC) to close the gap between the abstractions for modelling and reasoning about mechanisms and the use-inspired features of human behavior. The research is organized around a Grand Challenge of building systems and developing the underlying algorithms necessary to facilitate better decisions in online, deliberative, and interactive environments in ways that align with human values and under human control. To tackle this grand challenge, the research will focus on (1) developing new data, models, and metrics of agent preferences for both outcomes and mechanisms, and (2) fundamental research to create novel algorithms and mechanisms for human-centered computational social choice, to create a use-inspired feedback loop with the broader impacts of the award. All code and data collected and developed as part of this project will be released in the unified PrefLib framework and the project will support students in service learning classes to work with local non-profit stakeholders.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division Of Information & Intelligent Systems / Robust Intelligence (IIS/RI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As one of the largest universities in the nation, UCF is among the top three institutions enrolling transfer students and is recognized as a Hispanic Serving Institution.  Over its five-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to fifty unique full-time students who are pursuing Bachelor of Science (BS) or Master of Science (MS) degrees in the artificial intelligence (AI) fields of Computer Science, Computer Vision, Computer Engineering, Data Analytics, and Statistics & Data Science. With BS+MS programs in place, many of these students will be able to complete an MS degree in just 12 months after completion of a BS degree. All scholarship recipients will enter the program as transfer students entering the university and will receive support until graduation. These students are at a critical phase in their academic careers, at a time when obstacles of many varieties have the greatest potential to cause students to reconsider their paths, becoming vulnerable to attrition.  Each program participant is given a faculty mentor, who has expertise in his/her field of study, and a peer mentor, who is near graduation for a degree in that field. The mentors serve as a personal guides for the student as he/she navigates unknown territory at a new institution and begins challenging coursework. Scholarships provide freedom to focus on studies, without the additional burden of finding ways to pay for it.  Altogether, the support of a scholarship, a mentor, and a community of like-minded students, promises to reduce the obstacles students face, keep them interested in their field of study, and motivate them to excel academically. Students will be streamlined into existing research groups or industrial internships or REUs, which will later be used to place qualified students into the workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving students with demonstrated financial need.  The specific aims of the project are to (i) ensure scholars are retained past the first year, (ii) ensure scholars persist and complete a BS degree in high-need fields of AI, and (iii) substantially increase the number of MS degrees in AI fields.  To achieve the project goals, we will (a) provide transfer students a strong sense of belonging and establish their identities as AI scholars, (b) develop scholars? proficiency in AI through mentoring and advanced coursework, with potential for research and internships, and (c) provide clear pathways to MS degree completion with financial support.  The expected outcomes are 90% retention rate past the first year, 90% participation rate in internships or research projects, and 60% acceptance rate into MS degree programs in AI fields.  To ensure the project remains on track for achieving its goals, an external evaluator will monitor the selection and recruitment process, along with graduation and retention rates, as well as student and mentor activities.  Program results will be disseminated through the program webpage, reports at conferences and article publication.  This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving such a capability in robots would have a profound impact on autonomous robotic manipulation, revolutionizing various fields like domestic services, manufacturing, and logistics. This project has the potential to advance national prosperity and welfare by enabling robots to perform intricate object manipulation using multi-fingered hands. To reach this objective, this project identified as a core challenge the design of an appropriate interface between robot's sight sense and control of the hand. This interface is riddled by uncertainty because information that can be extracted from cameras through which the robot observes the environment is not precise and incomplete. Most existing approaches to robot manipulation with multifingered hands oversimplify this interface, often relying on perfect simulation or demonstrating limited tasks on real robotic hardware that often appear brittle. In contrast, proposed research supported by this award will look to develop a novel concept for robot manipulation, that captures both object shape and appearance. By integrating both types of information, novel method that is intended to be developed, can be used for keeping track of objects, inferring manipulation strategies, and accounting for uncertainty - all at the same time. The project?s novelties are in the algorithms for dexterous manipulation. Because it aims to enable complex manipulation skills such as tool use, assembly, object inspection or dense packing, this project?s impacts are to improve domestic services, manufacturing and logistics, as well as to develop courses on robotics, and provide immersive and engaging programming activities for K-12 students. <br/><br/><br/>The primary objective of this research project is to develop a novel approach for robotic dexterous manipulation that leverages the powerful new object representation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). NeRFs have recently emerged as a new representation of photorealistic 3D scenes constructed from RGB images alone. NeRFs are able to render synthetic photorealistic RGB images of the scene from camera view points not previously seen in the data. The core hypothesis is that not only appearance, but also full object shape is accurately encoded in the NeRF representation despite not being explicitly labeled in the training images. Therefore, NeRFs can provide the basis for novel grasping and manipulation algorithms that operate on unlabelled images alone, without requiring accurate object mesh models. The challenge is that this representation is nontraditional, as it represents the object as a volumetric density field without a distinct object ""surface,"" and therefore does not immediately lend itself to use with current grasping and manipulation algorithms. In this project, it is intended that fundamentally different ways of formalizing grasping and manipulation can be utilized by manipulation robots. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the NeRF density output in fact reflects a measure of uncertainty about the location of the true object surface. A sharp density transition indicates high confidence in the surface location, while a gradual transition indicates low certainty about the surface location. Therefore, developed grasping and manipulation algorithms will aim for robustness with respect to this measure of surface uncertainty. Robustness to object shape and pose uncertainty is essential for precision robot manipulation in the wild, and is largely unsolved. Ultimately, using the NeRF as an object representation, it is intended that an algorithmic pipeline to go from pixels to grasp to manipulation trajectory will be developed and validated in the hardware.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Center is a five year effort to further our understanding of the critical risk that climate change, and resulting cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs), pose to freshwater ecosystems and human health. Increased precipitation, more powerful storm events, and warming waters all encourage the proliferation of cHABs, which now occur in all five Great Lakes. The Center is organized around several overarching themes. The first is to resolve how climate change influences the occurrence of cHABs and the transport of the toxins they produce. The second is to understand toxin production and how toxins impact health, through both airborne and waterborne exposure. The third is to develop new technologies for enhanced monitoring and forecasting. In collaboration with agency and community partners the team will integrate findings into state-of-the-art forecasts and other data products that reach a wide stakeholder audience. A Community Engagement Core (CEC) will connect Center science to relevant communities, promoting co-design of research and communication of research outcomes to stakeholders. The team will leverage the Center?s research enterprise to recruit and train the next generation of scientists in the field of oceans and human health, including support for graduate students and postdocs. The Center's research, engagement, and training activities will advance progress toward the stated goals of understanding and translating climate change effects on cHAB events and their threats to human health in the Great Lakes region. The Center is jointly supported by NSF?s Division of Ocean Sciences and by the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).<br/><br/>The Center?s research is organized around four distinct but highly integrated projects. Project 1 seeks to determine how a changing climate influences the proliferation and toxin production of cHAB taxa. This project will use a multipronged field-lab experimental approach to test the hypothesis that climate-driven episodic events (e.g., storms) affect several classes of cyanotoxins (microcystins, anatoxins, saxitoxins, and anabaenopeptins), taste and odor compounds, and phycosphere interactions. Project 2 seeks to reveal the diversity, spatial and temporal distribution, and bioactivity of known and undiscovered toxins and other secondary metabolites. This project will use a combination of approaches (including metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) to characterize the diversity of emerging toxins and bioactive compounds currently invisible to methods used in routine water quality analysis. Project 3 will study toxin release from cHAB cells, aerosolization, and transport to test the hypothesis that climate change will increase human exposure to cHAB toxins through ingestion and inhalation. A combined measurement and modeling approach will be used to evaluate the impact of climate-change driven stressors on the distribution of dissolved and particulate toxins in both water bodies and aerosols generated from cHABs, enabling predictions of toxin exposure under a changing climate. Project 4 will assess the effects of aerosolized toxins on human health with a special focus on populations that are vulnerable due to pre-existing conditions, such as asthma. Project 4 will test the overall hypothesis that exposure to aerosolized cyanotoxins induces significant inflammation in the airway epithelium and that individuals with asthma are particularly susceptible to cHAB aerosols. Combined with the results of the other three projects, this work will enable assessment of human health risks of cHAB toxins under current conditions and future climate scenarios. In summary, the Great Lakes Center for Fresh Waters and Human Health aims to understand and communicate the risks of cHABs in the face of climate change through collaborative research, engagement efforts, and training initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To avoid this issue for human learners, tremendous effort has been spent in developing user manuals, field guides, tutorials, and other training documents that provide descriptions of how complex systems function. These allow the reader to bootstrap a useful mental model of a new system before actually interacting with it. Even when this mental model is incomplete, it may still provide a useful starting point that improves the speed and safety with which the reader learns to interact with a new system. For instance, an excavator's cockpit contains a multitude of joysticks, buttons, and pedals to control the excavator itself and its bucket arm. A description of their function would inform a new operator how to begin exploring the system, even if the exact sensitivity of the controls or speed of the motion was not well specified in the text. This is especially compelling compared to an overly eager operator that learns by trial and error without first consulting a manual. This project aims to extend a similar capability to artificially intelligent (AI) systems -- allowing AI systems to more efficiently learn to interact with new systems by reading manuals written in natural language. If realized, this capability will significantly expand the capacity for AI systems to perform digital and physical labor by reducing the cost to develop capable systems for new tasks. The project integrates research with education and outreaches to different groups including underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>From a machine learning perspective, developing AI systems that learn to act in complex interactive environments to achieve high-valued outcomes is often addressed through reinforcement learning techniques. Like our overly eager operator described above, standard methods rely on trial and error to learn. This project will develop a new model-based reinforcement learning paradigm in which natural language descriptions of ?how? an environment operates can be leveraged to efficiently learn a predictive model of the environment. This language-guided world model will be capable of simulating the effect of actions and will enable more rapid behavior learning. This project will address three research challenges ? 1) developing an empirical testbed for language-guided world model learning that enables systematic investigation of language grounding for descriptive text, 2) designing language-guided world models for both fully-observable and partially-observable settings, and 3) designing mechanisms for these models to adapt to new language over time. These research directions pave the way for artificially intelligent systems to better comprehend and predict complex behaviors described in language and to leverage these descriptions to learn interactive tasks more efficiently.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the success of these language models in generating fluent and convincing-looking outputs, there has been a growing body of work indicating that these systems can generate outputs that are undesirable to users, model creators, and even society at large. This gap between the ability to create models that imitate humans and the inability to have them fulfill specific desiderata (e.g. refuse to generate incorrect information) shows a major deficiency in the ability to precisely control these systems. This project aims to build principled, transparent, and precise methods for controlling language models.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, this project views controllable generation as a viable long-term path to creating instruction-following language models that precisely follow our design goals. Controllable generation offers several benefits. First, it defines a precise statistical modeling problem on which it is possible to build principled methods and rigorous evaluations. Second, it separates the control target from the task, improving transparency by allowing users to see exactly what is being optimized by the model designers. Third, it enables much more precise controls via inference-time methods such as rejection sampling, which strictly enforces the control as a constraint. While controllable generation has major long-term benefits for language models, there also remain significant open problems that must be resolved first, including the difficulty of performing discrete search, the need for specialized training, and the lack of realistic benchmarks of control tasks in the wild. We will address these challenges through a combination of new models (such as diffusion-based models), zero-shot and decoder-based control methods, and a broad benchmark of in-the-wild control behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this critical importance, even sophisticated upper extremity prostheses for children do not provide movement feedback; they remain numb, disconnected tools prone to rejection.  This project will explore non-invasive strategies to provide pediatric prosthesis users with movement feedback, either as feelings of their missing hand moving or as vibrations on their skin. The research will investigate how best to apply these techniques for effective pediatric prosthesis control, and will afford a deeper understanding of the role kinesthesia plays in these children?s ability to learn tasks and embody their prosthetic limb.  Project outcomes will contribute interdisciplinary knowledge (in engineering, neuroscience, and pediatric care) that has important implications for developing prosthetic devices that amplify children's physical capabilities, informing treatment strategies, and providing a quantitative understanding of children's sensorimotor abilities.  The work will be tightly integrated with the education plan through various mechanisms, including engaging children with limb differences in exciting summer camp activities, broadening access to prostheses in under-served communities, providing research opportunities for historically under-represented students, and developing undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>Two non-invasive strategies to provide pediatric prosthesis users with kinesthetic (movement) feedback will be the focus of the research. The first will use a vibration-based perceptual illusion that restores the sense of missing hand movements, while the second will employ haptic buzzing (skin vibration) to encode prosthesis movement information.  The core hypothesis is that providing pediatric prosthesis users with kinesthetic feedback will improve prosthetic control, the learning of motor tasks, and device embodiment, and that these effects will be heightened when the feedback is experienced as illusory missing-hand movements.  To validate this hypothesis, vibration parameters will first be modeled and refined so that they can be tuned to effectively communicate prosthetic movement characteristics.  The effects of kinesthetic feedback (illusory and buzzing) on subjects? learning of novel prosthetic control tasks will then be characterized using a human-prosthesis co-adaptive paradigm.

While we only observe it via 2D retinal percepts, we have the remarkable ability to understand the underlying 3D structure from such 2D observations. Indeed, this ability is central to accomplishing a plethora of tasks in our day-to-day lives, e.g., we can understand the shape of the cup we are about to grasp or the width of the partially visible chair behind the table when planning to sit. The goal of this project is to develop perception systems that can similarly infer the 3D structure of generic objects or scenes from 2D images. While current computer vision methods can reconstruct accurate 3D from 2D images, they cannot do so given partial observations and typically require dense multi-view captures. In contrast, this project will enable reconstruction given a few (or just one) casually captured 2D images of objects and scenes. Such a system can immediately unlock applications across robotics and graphics, e.g., allowing robots to reason with complete 3D representations of objects they are interacting with, or enabling designers to easily virtualize and manipulate scenes from just a few images. This project will also contribute to the development of graduate and undergraduate students via research involvement and specialized courses and benefit the community at large through dissemination of research and organization of tutorials.<br/><br/>This project develops a generic framework that allows leveraging expressive generative priors for high-fidelity 3D inference. The key insight is that 3D inference can be cast as a mode seeking optimization under the likelihood induced by generative priors in conjunction with the available image observations. As a first contribution, this project will formulate mechanisms for learning novel 3D generative priors that can be leveraged in this framework. Specifically, by learning diffusions models that can co-generate multi-view images or directly synthesize 3D without requiring 3D training data, this project will capture the distribution over plausible 3D structures. Building on these, the project will develop inference mechanisms to tackle different 3D reconstruction tasks such as: (a) reconstructing generic objects from single or few views, (b) obtaining relightable 3D representations from casual captures by disentangling the materials from environmental illumination, and (c) inferring editable 3D representations of complex scenes by factoring them into independent components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different from traditional camera-based solutions, the sensing systems built on these methods work even in the dark or when the view is blocked, and they don?t invade privacy. Thus, they can lead to advanced applications such as round-the-clock monitoring for the elderly without compromising their privacy, helping rescue teams see through walls during fires, and keeping track of passengers in foggy weather. Despite the usefulness of wireless sensing systems, their prevalence is restricted by their limited performance in new environments or for new tasks. This project aims to develop generalized wireless human sensing frameworks, which will result in improved system performance in those new scenarios and reduce the deployment efforts of the systems in the real world.  The project will result in algorithms that can be broadly applicable in wireless human sensing and enable a wide range of applications in smart homes, healthcare, robotics, smart cities, entertainment, etc. Additionally, this project will provide opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds to get involved in this research area and will contribute to a new course on wireless sensing at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. <br/><br/>This research improves the generalizability of wireless sensing models by taking advantage of other modalities, which contains two thrusts.

In the second thrust, models from other modalities are leveraged to improve generalization. By aligning the wireless signal embeddings with the activity-related text or image embeddings from the pre-trained vision language models, the wireless model can conduct open-class activity recognition tasks.

(2) What are the relative contributions of primary and secondary sources to whole ecosystem oxygenated BVOC fluxes and how do they respond to changes in canopy structure and speciation? (3) To what extent do urban and agricultural landscapes contribute to BVOC emissions and can emission responses to land management practices change regional oxidant and aerosol distributions? In addition to support for a postdoctoral research, a graduate student, and undergraduate students, this team will prepare two one-hour scientific activities to introduce the fundamentals of BVOC emission measurement and modeling to middle school students and how this can be applied in managed landscapes. This program is designed to serve underrepresented groups to demonstrate STEM as a career option.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increased computing power, the availability of large digital data sets, and algorithmic advances in machine learning and Generative AI have made it possible for AI research and development to create new sectors of the economy and revitalize industries. Development of talent in AI is of utmost importance to ensure continued advancement and economic growth in AI with the potential for significant economic impact and quality-of-life improvements for all members of our society.  Yet there are limited opportunities for undergraduate students to further their education and research in Artificial Intelligence despite its recognition as a STEM field of great importance and visibility in society recently (given the rise of ChatGPT and Generative AI).   This program fills this gap by providing undergraduate students underrepresented in STEM the access to engage in meaningful Artificial Intelligence research. In particular, this project provides students from institutions across the country the opportunity to participate in AI research in WPI's Department of Computer Science and the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence programs via Research Undergraduate Experience summer sites successfully operated at WPI since 2016. The focus of this site is to tackle societal challenges in tackling bias and information integrity, advancing personalized digital health, and modeling critical resources such as renewable energy and human mobility - all interlinked concerns of national importance.  <br/><br/>This project provides a unique educational experience for undergraduate students by engaging them in vibrant research projects through which they tackle critical societal challenges via Artificial Intelligence tools and techniques. The students work in research teams, closely mentored by WPI faculty advisors and graduate students, and have ownership of a project for the duration of the summer.  Undergraduate students participating in this project are trained in the best-practices AI-modeling pipeline from data preparation, model development, model evaluation, to model deployment. Further, they design and apply these techniques to solve impactful problems.  Given the opportunity to solve pressing problems related to society and our well-being, the students are empowered to make a difference. To supplement the educational and research skill development of students, a weekly seminar series on professional development covering topics from research inquiry, ethics, communication skills to career opportunities in AI are held and networking events with industry partners are offered. Their involvement in this research program provides students the interpersonal communication, professional networking skills, and AI research skills that they would not encounter in the classroom, and thus encourages the students to find their interest and consider graduate studies. This project ultimately prepares students for AI-related professions with the potential for exciting leadership career opportunities -- thus contributing to the STEM workforce and the US economic prosperity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The critical dependence of weather and climate on heat and moisture fluxes from the ocean means that any restriction on those fluxes can have an outsized influence on the convective clouds and their large-scale effects.  Previous work by the Principal Investigators (PIs) has shown that rainwater falling on the ocean can form a ""cold lid"", also called a rain layer, that restricts air-sea fluxes.  Fresh rainwater is less dense than salty sea water, thus rain falling on the ocean stays at the surface and forms a shallow stable layer typically less than a meter thick and slightly colder than the underlying ocean.  The lower temperature of the cold lid can inhibit the onset of convection, which in turn can allow more sunlight to reach the ocean, most of which passes through the lid to warm the ocean below it.  But when convection develops it can generate strong surface winds that break up the lid and expose the warmer ocean, thus intensifying convection. <br/><br/>Work performed here explores the implications of this delay-then-intensify effect for the aggregation of individual convective clouds into broad areas of organized convection, and for the development of El Nino events.  In both cases the work focuses on the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a broad area of organized convection that forms in the Indian Ocean and propagates slowly eastward across the Pacific.  The MJO generates westerly wind bursts (WWBs), periods of strong west-to-east surface winds along the equator, which promote the development of El Nino events.  Thus the intensification of MJO convection through the cold lid mechanism could affect El Nino by intensifying WWBs.  <br/><br/>The research is carried out through comparison of model simulations in which cold lid effects are either active or disabled, some involving a regional atmospheric model (the Weather Research and Forecasting model) coupled to a regional ocean model with very high vertical resolution near the surface so that rain layers can be simulated.  Other simulations use the Community Earth System Model (CESM), a global model which simulates El Nino events but lacks the fine resolution needed to explicitly represent rain layers and the cold lid mechanism.  Instead the PIs implement a new ocean surface flux parameterization which indirectly captures the flux restriction caused by the cold lid.  Some simulations are performed with higher levels of carbon dioxide to investigate the effects of the cold lid in a warmer climate.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the substantial weather and climate impacts of the MJO and El Nino, which include changes in the frequency of landfalling hurricanes and atmospheric rivers in the US.  Models used for weather prediction and climate projections typically produce MJO events which are too weak and propagate too fast, thus the delay and intensification produced by the cold lid mechanisms could be a missing ingredient in these models.  The project has educational value as it provides support and training to a graduate student.  The PIs also serve as mentors to summer interns at the CSU Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With special sensors measuring vibrations and temperature, the investigators aim to measure where and when icebergs detach from the glacier and fall into the ocean. The investigators also want to find out where warm ocean water is melting the ice and if there is a connection to the speed at which the glacier flows into the ocean. The measurements will help us learn more about how Greenland's glaciers will change in the future and what that might mean for sea levels around the world.

To test this hypothesis, the investigators will deploy a new optical fiber instrument at the calving front of the Qajuuttap Sermia tidewater glacier in Greenland. This instrument will measure acoustic and temperature data to better understand the effect of sub-glacial melt and discharge on calving.

This work will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Washington.  The bacteria that reside in the guts of animals affect a wide range of host traits. These include their digestion, metabolism, immunity, disease, and even behavior. However, there is relatively little current understanding of what a healthy set of gut bacteria looks like. In addition, how these sets are built in each host as they grow is also not well known. Over time, bacteria have adapted to their host animal species. Lab mouse-adapted bacteria grow more easily in the gut of lab mice than bacteria that come from other mouse species. So, there is a home-site advantage for these bacteria. It is not known if the opposite is true in other mouse species. This project will generate new tools to look at host-bacteria relationships, including brand new germ-free mice that are closely related to widely-used lab mice. Competition between bacteria adapted to each mouse line will show how these animals adapt to their bacteria. Particular attention will be paid to how the host immune system responds to each set of bacteria and if non-adapted bacteria result in poorer health for the mice. Understanding how bacteria and hosts adapt to each other is vital to improving health via treatment of the gut.  This project will advance the University of Nebraska?s Gnotobiotic Mouse program's capabilities and enhance research capacity in Nebraska and the Midwest region.<br/><br/>The gut microbiota is known to exert a tremendous influence over host metabolism, immune development, behavior, and many other traits. Hosts and microbiota have adapted to each other over many years, and species have distinct bacterial population profiles. However, a lack of appropriate model organisms, including germ-free Mus species other than the laboratory strain Mus musculus domesticus, has limited the resolution at which research about adaptations and interactions between hosts and their resident microbiota can be addressed. The goal of this project is to determine host-microbiota co-adaptations that affect the assembly of microbial populations in the gut and alter host development. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 EPSCoR Research Fellows (RII Track-4) project will provide a fellowship to an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This work will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Washington. This fellowship will train the PI in germ-free mouse rederivation techniques and generate a first-of-their-kind resource, germ-free Mus spicilegus (shrew mouse) and Mus pahari (steppe mouse), two mouse species closely related to laboratory mice. It will also produce critical data on adaptations between hosts and microbes that define how microbes assemble within gut communities and how host immune responses are affected by those bacteria. The new germ-free mouse lines will be generated by sterile cesarean murine births. The new mouse models will be reconstituted with conspecific (from the same mouse species) and heterospecific (from alternate mouse species) microbiota to evaluate whether adapted bacteria outcompete non-adapted species. Host immune responses educated by those bacteria with be analyzed to determine changes in host inflammation driven by responses to those bacteria. Understanding these basic microbe-host interactions and the mechanisms underlying them provides a strong rationale for eventual therapeutic alterations of the gut microbiome.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries. Over two billion people who live along the Indian Ocean's rim are impacted by its climate. However, large uncertainty persists for how the region's climate will change in the future under sustained greenhouse forcing. This project will provide the first estimates of short-term temperature variability in the Indian Ocean during a past warm climate period. To do this, the researchers will analyze sediment in cores collected from the Indian Ocean. The analyses will help to determine changes in temperatures in the tropical?subtropical Indian Ocean during the Pliocene. These data will also be combined with climate model output to determine whether a warmer Indian Ocean had greater seasonal and year-to-year variability. Understanding the Indian Ocean during this past warm period may highlight the future climate risks for the region and beyond.

The postdoctoral scholar will help lead the project and mentor students. The students will include a high school student and a student from a Tribal College in Arizona.<br/><br/>Since 2000, surface waters in the Indian Ocean have warmed faster than in the Atlantic and Pacific basins. This has raised concerns about how the interannual Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode of variability and associated risks of extreme weather events will be affected by global warming. In this project, the researchers will investigate Indian Ocean climate variability and IOD-related dynamics during the mid-Pliocene period (~3 Ma), when global temperatures were approximately 2-3C higher than preindustrial levels. Marine sedimentary archives will be analyzed to provide detailed information on subdecadal temperature variability across the tropical?subtropical Indian Ocean during this period. In concert with these paleodata, the team will also perform climate simulations at the UK Met Office (UKESM1-HADGEM3) to determine whether a warmer Indian Ocean experienced greater seasonal to interannual variability. This research will test whether patterns of climate variability during the warm mid-Pliocene interval align with a recently proposed hypothesis that the Indian Ocean can harbor an ""El Nio-like"" equatorial mode of enhanced interannual variability, distinct from the IOD, under altered climatic states. The emergence of such a mode in a warmer-than-present interval of Earth?s history holds significant implications for future climate risk precipitated by Indian Ocean dynamics.

However, such residues are not in random nor uniform patterns, and they often appear as circular spots with a bright center and a dark rim.

Apart from its everyday relevance, the evaporation-driven deposition of solutes offers a simple, inexpensive method for assembling complex miniature structures. This method can also be used as a diagnostic tool for forensic analysis, disease examination, and biodetection.

The planned studies are coupled with a range of educational activities that involve outreach to underrepresented middle and high school students, mentorship of diverse community college and graduate students, and curriculum development.<br/><br/>This award aims to investigate the transport and aggregation of nonvolatile particles in drying colloidal sessile drops with the ultimate goal of understanding the mechanisms underlying various deposition patterns. Specifically, high-fidelity numerical simulations and theoretical analyses will be used to study the (i) role of the liquid-gas interface in the evolution of the evaporative self-assembly process, (ii) impact of shape and polydispersity on transport and deposition of solutes, and (iii) sensitivity of particle transport and deposition to droplet geometry and shielding effect. The findings of this award will narrow the gap in our current knowledge and fundamental understanding of the evaporation-induced transport, self-assembly, and deposition of particles initially suspended in a sessile drop of a simple liquid. They will also establish a transformative physics-based regime map for deposition patterns that can serve as an engineering guideline for tailoring the system parameters in order to elicit the desired self-assembled structure for a variety of high-tech applications. The map can also be utilized as a diagnostic tool for pinpointing the properties of the suspended particles and the nature of their interactions with themselves, with the liquid-gas interface, and with the substrate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The teacher shortage in combination with conditionally certified teachers has left many local secondary students without highly qualified STEM teachers. As one of the nation's largest school districts, Prince George's County Public Schools, serving a diverse student body, this is an issue of educational equity. Therefore, this project at the University of Maryland, College Park, (UMD) will recruit diverse STEM candidates from large prospective teacher pools on campus and within the local community.  The project team will continue to improve the UMD equity-focused teacher preparation pathway and provide an enhanced internship experience for recipients. The project aims to retain graduates in the field by providing induction support during their first three years of teaching. This project is expected to increase, retain, and diversify the number of highly qualified certified STEM teachers locally for the good of the public. <br/><br/>This project at the University of Maryland, College Park, includes partnerships with Prince George?s County Public Schools (PGCPS), specifically DuVal High School. Project goals include (1) enhancing and expanding the number of candidates utilizing teacher preparation pathways by providing scholarships and stipends to teacher candidates and (2) improving long-term retention in teaching by providing three years of induction support. The project aims to produce three cohorts of 10 highly qualified STEM teachers each year (approximately 30 total over the project). This includes secondary mathematics, science, and computer science teachers. The project team will enhance the equity-focused teacher preparation experience by offering one-year, renewable scholarships ($11,500 each) for undergraduates and one-year stipends ($23,000 each) for post-baccalaureates to support the completion of the teacher certification programs. Three years of induction support will be offered including online modules, virtual coaching, summer book clubs, in-person observations with feedback, and conference support. This project will evaluate the extent to which financial support increases the number of students graduating with STEM certification, with specific attention to students from groups underrepresented in STEM. Moreover, the project will evaluate to what extent the induction efforts support teacher retention. Not only will highly qualified, diverse STEM teachers benefit the local communities, but they will increase and strengthen the pool of potential STEM majors and thus benefit society more broadly. The findings of this project will be disseminated nationally with the UTeach network and other teacher preparation programs via conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

However, automation of multiple critical care treatments presents unique challenges.  Each treatment given to a patient elicits multiple physiological changes.  Thus, when multiple isolated automated treatments are given to a patient, they can conflict and drive the patient to unsafe physiological states.  Regardless, most previous work has neglected such conflicts.  To address this challenge, we will develop innovative mathematical algorithms to enable safe automated patient monitoring, treatment guidance, and reconciliation of potentially conflicting medical treatments.  We will achieve this goal by leveraging and advancing theory of control, inference, and optimization, thereby creating new knowledge in these fields.  Successful completion of this project will lead to new approaches to the coordination and mediation of complex interacting automation systems, including healthcare and medical systems.<br/><br/>This project brings together the (cyber) disciplines of data science and control theory, in support of safe and conflict-aware automated treatments in the (physical) discipline of patient therapeutics. We propose to develop a transformative universal framework that can mediate conflicts and assure patient safety in the automation of complex critical care loops in medical CPS.  We will develop (i) physiological monitoring enabled by sequential filtering to track the safety of a patient?s internal state using limited measurements; (ii) mediation of complex therapeutic loops enabled by multivariable nonlinear output-feedback control augmented by barrier certificates; and (iii) dynamic updating of treatment setpoints enabled by population-informed adaptation to determine safely reachable patient-specific treatment setpoints.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework using a complex critical care resuscitation application as a compelling case study.  The success of this project will lead to a suite of innovative technologies deployable to various medical care settings, which can drastically advance autonomy in next-generation medical CPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scholarly field for language study is linguistics, and one linguistic framework is generative linguistic theory. Important areas of study in this domain include how languages are represented in the human mind, how these mental representations are acquired by children, how the different languages of a bilingual or a second language learner influence each other, and how language acquisition proceeds in the presence of developmental disabilities. In addition to advancing a scientific understanding of how the human mind works and how learning proceeds, research on second language acquisition has practical implications for many other fields including literacy development, foreign language instruction, and the identification and treatment of language disorders.<br/><br/>This conference brings together established researchers and junior scholars who study second language acquisition and bilingualism from the generative perspective. The conference addresses core questions on how second and bilingual language acquisition proceeds and features a special session focusing on advances in psycholinguistics and computational approaches. The special session examines how second language learners and bilinguals process linguistic input and the mechanisms for second language acquisition, as well as how recent advances in computational modelling and tools have opened new research paradigms and novel insights. The convergent use of behavioral data and computational modeling can be a powerful tool to promote theory development, facilitate the interpretation of behavioral findings, and generate hypotheses for new second language research.  The conference features four invited talks by prominent researchers with expertise in bilingual and second language acquisition of grammatical phenomena, and, in the case of the two special session speakers, psycholinguistics and computational modelling.

As the moon?s shadow sweeps across the contiguous United States, it provides a natural laboratory to study the ionosphere?a partially ionized region of our atmosphere that plays a crucial role in radio communication, navigation, and space weather. During a solar eclipse, the reduction in solar radiation leads to a decrease in ionization. The investigators plan to take advantage of the upcoming solar eclipse in 2024 through coordinated multi-instruments observations of ionospheric parameters. The proposed work will deepen our understanding of the chemical and dynamical processes in the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system. Such events impact the plasma density, which adversely affects High Frequency (HF: 3-30 MHz) propagation and communication signals. While the macroscopic effects on the IT response are well understood, the detailed features controlling the ionospheric density including the transport in the F-region and topside ionosphere remain unclear. The project will strengthen collaborations with the citizen science community, support two early-career scientists and an undergraduate summer student. This project benefits society by improving communication reliability, enhancing space weather predictions, and supporting education and diversity in STEM fields.<br/><br/>One of the main objectives of the proposal is to understand and quantify the relative importance of external forces on the ionospheric density responses to the October 2023 and April 2024 solar eclipses as observed by HF sounding and compare the findings with the August 2017 solar eclipse. The proposal will focus on the following scientific topics: 1. Quantification of Eclipse-Driven Ionospheric Changes: the project seeks to understand how solar eclipses impact the ionosphere's electron density. It plans to investigate variations in the F-region height (HmF2) and the occurrence of the ionospheric G-condition (where NmF1?NmF2), (2) Identification of Controlling Factors: By analyzing data from ground-based HF facilities, the researchers will quantify the relative importance of various factors in determining the ionospheric responses, including reduced EUV Flux, thermospheric winds, photoelectron transport and heating. The proposed scientific investigation involves the use of the SuperDARN, the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter Radar (MHISR), and HamSCI HF observations. This work encourages training and education of the younger generation and facilitates capacity building through the involvement of early career scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Great Lakes are the largest surface freshwater system in the world and are a critical resource for more than 30 million people. Climate change is impacting the Great Lakes in significant ways, with warming water, decreased pH, and shifting precipitation patterns. At the same time, plastic pollution is accumulating in the lakes, with largely unknown consequences for ecosystem and human health. This Center will address critical understudied changes within the Great Lakes that have significance for human health. Because of the many unknowns about every stage of the plastic cycle, multidisciplinary systems science approaches are needed to advance understanding and inform solutions. When microplastics enter the environment, transformations occur that may impact their bioactivity. Breakdown of plastic debris depends on the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of the lake, all of which are affected by climate changes. Human exposure to microplastics may occur through ingestion, inhalation of airborne particles, and skin contact. Small microplastics are of particular concern because of their potential to enter the body, breech the epithelial barrier, and interact with cells. The Center will be built around 1) three separate but integrated research projects, 2) a common facility on materials and measurement that will serve all three projects, and 3) a Community Engagement Core focused on multidirectional engagement with community partners. The center will engage with a broad and diverse coalition of partners to both conduct community science and promote environmental health literacy.  These activities include involving residents in efforts to monitor debris flows, and developing, evaluating, and disseminating outreach materials for audiences including youth, educators, community groups, and policy makers in both urban and rural settings. The project will provide training for postdoctoral research fellows, graduate and undergraduate students. The Center is jointly supported by NSF?s Division of Ocean Sciences and by the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).<br/><br/>The Center?s research is built around the hypothesis that the interactions between climate change and freshwater plastic pollution will have increasingly negative consequences for human and environmental health. The Materials and Metrology Core will generate ?virgin? microplastics and characterize real-world microplastics samples for use by three research projects, while developing novel approaches to facilitate future microplastics and human health research. Project 1 builds on several years of work aimed at understanding the input, transport and fate of anthropogenic debris in the Lake Ontario basin in order to better predict the risk of plastic pollution in Lake Ontario. Informed by these preliminary studies, the team hypothesizes that climate-related factors will increase the delivery of post-consumer plastic to Lake Ontario through increased stormwater runoff, and that projected changes in temperature, pH, and storm intensity will (1) increase leaching and the rate of degradation and formation of secondary microplastics, (2) promote biofilm formation and abundance of pathogenic and antibiotic resistant organisms, and (3) enhance ecotoxicity. The project will measure debris accumulation in the terrestrial (mostly urban) system, measure input to waterways in stormwater, and assess the role of precipitation in debris transport across environments with different surface and population characteristics. Project 2 builds on on-going studies that demonstrate the utility of nanomembrane technology to filter water and concentrate microplastics in the retentate and to sample microplastics from air to facilitate research on the bioavailability of microplastic. The project will evaluate the presence of microplastics in size ranges that can breech epithelial barriers in Lake Ontario water that may contact skin and/or be accidentally ingested and in nearshore air samples to quantify respirable microplastics. Project 3 will leverage the amphibian Xenopus to rigorously assess microplastics biodistribution and accumulation in post-embryonic tadpole tissues, using both virgin and environmentally-derived microplastics, then evaluate the acute and long-term effects resulting from microplastics ingestion on the development of an efficient immune system and antiviral immunity under environmental conditions that mimic those projected to occur with climate change. The team will also use results to identify reliable biomarkers applicable for human studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the devices envisioned herein will simultaneously control ?phoXons? (i.e., phonons or photons) and the interactions between them to enable unique opportunities. The research and education plans proposed in this project will directly advance national priorities such as the CHIPS and Science Act and the National Quantum Initiative by revolutionizing multifunctional phoXonic microsystems. This project will develop approaches to enable enhanced functionality in radio-frequency front-end (RFFE) signal processing components that can provide a paradigm shift for system efficiency and spectrum utilization in the $20 billion global market for RFFE modules by enabling seamless integration of major components, which currently require separate modules. Likewise, distributed quantum processing through microwave-optical transducers will generate new opportunities for addressing major societal problems such as drug discovery and supply chain optimization. Given the massive proliferation of communication and computing technologies in the coming years, there is a distinct need for engineers conversant in manipulating acoustic, optical and electric fields using modern semiconductor technology. Collaborating with the highly successful Center for STEM Education at Northeastern University, the proposed educational/outreach program will also engage more than 50 students (primary school ? graduate levels) in each year of the program, through STEM field trips, high school programs, undergraduate research and a 2-course sequence on phononic integrated circuits to attract new students to the field.<br/><br/>This CAREER project is dedicated to advancing novel functionalities in RF acoustic microsystems and enabling highly reconfigurable acousto-optics. This will be implemented through the development of the Semiconductor on Nitride PhoXonic Integrated Circuit (SONIC). The core contributions of this program will involve the success of 4 major tasks: 1) demonstration of low-loss phononic devices, 2) efficient acoustic wave amplification, 3) acousto-optic system development and 4) acoustoelectrically-enhanced optomechanical structures. While these device classes have all been validated in separate demonstrations, they have never been co-integrated in this manner. Based on strong preliminary results from the PI?s laboratory, the PI hypothesizes this approach will offer significant advances to the state-of-the-art (SoA) in applications such as integrated circulators, reconfigurable time-delay synthesizers, efficient acousto-optic modulators and enhanced Brillouin effects in ultra-stable chip-scale lasers. SONIC devices will therefore provide significant impacts in producing compact systems that can concurrently serve multiple bands (0.1-20 GHz), provide a trade-off of gain with added bandwidth and enable loss-compensated delays spanning a range not accessible with CMOS or photonics alone. SONIC will also enable hybrid quantum systems using phonon buses or microwave-optical conversion for next-generation quantum networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is an urgent environmental challenge and to address it, it is essential to provide alternatives to the use of fossil fuels that generate greenhouse gases. Nearly all the jet fuel or aviation fuel in use today is made from crude oil, which is a fossil fuel. This project provides an alternative technology that makes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using only carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from waste sources, relatively small volumes of water, and renewable (e.g., solar and wind) electricity. Catalysts are one of the key components of the process that is used to produce this SAF, helping the chemical reactions that produce the fuel occur more efficiently. This project will optimize the catalysts for improved production of SAF.  <br/> <br/>This STTR Phase II project seeks to significantly improve SAF production by developing and characterizing catalysts that convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into the hydrocarbon constituents in sustainable aviation fuels using advanced characterization techniques such as x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. The process will use catalysts as mimics for photosynthesis, taking air (as a CO2 source), water (as a hydrogen source) and sunlight (as an energy source) and converting them into sustainable chemicals and transportation fuels.  The only by-products are oxygen and water. Many other related processes often rely on multiple reaction steps to target the same products. This project develops a novel family of proprietary catalysts to convert CO2 to fuels and chemicals in a single step via a direct CO2 hydrogenation process, enabling yields even greater than the theoretical maximum of legacy processes, such as Fischer-Tropsch. This new process eliminates the need for extra intermediate steps that negatively affect process energy demands, emissions, capital and operational cost, and product selling price. The successful outcome of the project will allow significant improvements in production and economics of sustainable aviation fuels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, online liquid democracy platforms allow users to vote directly on a topic or delegate their vote to a trusted proxy whom they believe is more informed and will represent their interests. These systems have allowed businesses to make collective decisions on issues ranging from product design to food offered in the corporate cafeteria. However, recent audits of algorithms used in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems have taught us that algorithmic decisions made by computers have the potential to unintentionally disadvantage individuals or groups of people. Such algorithmic bias and discrimination can be countered by designing algorithms with specific fairness guarantees built in. This project will investigate computational social choice through an algorithmic fairness lens and illuminate the theoretical limitations of achieving difficult or conflicting concepts of fairness. In addition to advancing knowledge that benefits society and the research community, topics studied in this project will be used to enrich courses at every level of the computer science curriculum with engaging real-world applications, and lessons featuring these topics will be shared with the broader computer science education community. Finally, the investigator will mentor undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups in computer science, diversifying the pipeline to graduate school. <br/><br/>Algorithms are commonly used to implement existing and proposed preference aggregation/voting systems as well as to analyze them. At the same time, algorithmic bias and discrimination has been documented in a broad range of applications from hiring to medicine to criminal justice. In many of these areas, the research community has responded by formalizing computational definitions of fairness and designing algorithms that explicitly offer fairness guarantees, especially for machine learning tasks such as classification or recommendation. At a high level, this project seeks to unite computational social choice and the recent research into algorithmic fairness and fairness, accountability, and transparency (FAccT) in automated systems more broadly. The main contributions to computer science and other disciplines will be: (1) Formulating new computational problems, objectives, and constraints for implementing and evaluating voting systems that can guide future work in algorithmic fairness that is grounded in a specific real-world application; (2) Designing and analyzing algorithms for these problems that can provide fairness guarantees; and (3) Proving impossibility results that establish which notions of fairness in these settings are incompatible with each other or intractable. A focus of (1) will be to build connections between foundational, theoretical work in algorithmic fairness and specific application areas in computational social choice. The work of (3) will echo the seminal impossibility results in the areas of both algorithmic fairness and social choice theory. Thus, (1) and (3) will inform the investigator?s own work on (2), but also pose new problems to the research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to the strong hail impact on personal and business property, the agricultural and renewable energy sectors also suffer. Advanced polarimetric weather radars are the best instruments to remotely detect hail in the clouds, estimate its size, and produce timely warnings of impending hail if guided by the physical cloud models that predict hail growth and its fallout on the surface. However, existing methodologies for quantifying and forecasting large hail have serious limitations which will be mitigated as a result of the project. This project will capitalize on the unique observations of hail from the armored T-28 research aircraft that penetrated hail-bearing storms during multiple field campaigns in the past. Combining direct hail measurements within the cloud aloft and at the surface with cloud modeling describing its evolution on the way to the ground and the collocated polarimetric radar observations within the full depth of the storm will help to better understand the microphysical processes of hail generation and develop more advanced methodologies for its quantification and prediction / nowcasting.<br/><br/>The technical approach will involve utilization of the documented measurements of sizes, number concentrations, and shapes of hailstones aloft to initialize the cloud model. The model involves spectral bin microphysics describing the evolution of hailstones including the change of hail size and kinetic energy with height within the storm as they fall to the surface.  The output of the cloud model will be converted into the vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables which will be compared to the associated measured profiles. This will allow to retrieve size distribution of hail above the melting layer using vertical profiles of radar variables associated with melting hail within the melting layer and beneath and will serve as an observational reference for cloud models? evaluation and optimization.  Novel polarimetric radar predictors in deep convective updrafts signifying large or giant hail at the surface will be identified and explored across a wide range of thermodynamic and climatological regimes and height of the surface relative to sea level using polarimetric radar data collected by the operational WSR-88D radars in a multitude of particularly devastating hailstorms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The performance of these units is often dictated by the memory system?s capacity and bandwidth. While Dual-Data Rate (DDR) has been the de facto memory interface for the last three decades, the technological landscape is changing to accommodate the increasing demands put on the memory system. After several years of competition among new interconnect technologies, Compute Express Link (CXL) is establishing itself as the winner, with widespread industry adoption. CXL is well-positioned to change the way high-performance computing systems are built and deployed, in part due to its versatility: the same interconnect technology can be used to connect processors with peripheral devices, specialized hardware accelerators, and memory expansion devices. The crucial observation driving the project?s intended research is that CXL-centric or CXL-augmented memory systems bear characteristics that cater well to the growing memory capacity and bandwidth demands of workloads prevalent in datacenter and high-performance computing environments, and therefore have transformational potential for computing systems with crucial commercial significance in modern digital economies. In addition to contributing new system designs that improve system performance and efficiency, the project?s activities will enrich educational activities, introducing the student body and future workforce to the emerging CXL technology.<br/> <br/>The project will investigate new memory system organizations enabled by CXL. The investigators will pursue opportunities in leveraging CXL?s (i) bandwidth superiority as a potential replacement for conventional DDR-attached memory in bandwidth-constrained systems; (ii) ability to enable disaggregated, selectively shareable memory across multiple hosts to develop new architectures that deliver superior performance via effective sharing of a common memory pool; and (iii) ability to multiplex memory and I/O traffic to improve the efficiency of bandwidth-intensive systems. Finally, the project will investigate new fault tolerance and data placement challenges that emerge in the presence of hybrid CXL-DDR memory systems, and develop new software and hardware techniques to address them. The project?s activities will produce methodologies to study such new memory systems, and evaluate novel CXL-enabled memory architectures that improve the performance, efficiency, and workload consolidation capability of commercially crucial systems used in datacenter and high-performance computing environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Level 2, Engaged Student Learning Track project will investigate the experiences of Black students in lower-division mathematics courses and design interventions that address barriers for student success in order to create supportive learning environments in these courses. Research shows that the use of student-centered, active learning techniques in introductory STEM courses leads to improved student outcomes. However, despite these improvements, achievement gaps still persist for racially minoritized students. This issue is highlighted for Black students attending HSIs where they may experience cultural mismatches and hostility through lack of support and minimal interaction with peers. Understanding the experiences of Black students in these courses is essential for creating support mechanisms and classroom structures that support the engagement and success of these students. This project will take place at Florida International University (FIU), a research-intensive HSI. Since 25% of all Black students in the US are enrolled at HSIs, FIU is an ideal setting for advancing the knowledge of experiences of Black students at these institutions who are enrolled in mathematics courses where they are expected to engage with their peers. The results of this project will inform classroom and instructional practices impacting more than 14,000 students enrolled each year in lower-division mathematics courses. Additionally, the investigation of Black students? experiences and the resulting knowledge will serve to support more active learning approaches and efforts for equity and inclusion in mathematics courses at FIU and other higher education institutions.<br/><br/>The project, conducted in multiple phases, will investigate Black students? experiences in active learning introductory mathematics courses and create interventions with the goal of creating supportive learning environments. The investigation of student experiences will be conducted during the first qualitative phase of the project using interviews with Black students enrolled in mathematics courses which implement high levels of active learning and peer interaction. The goal for this phase will be to explore feelings of visibility and sense of belonging among these students in order to identify themes that will be used for the next phase of co-designing interventions with students. During the second phase, the findings from the initial phase will be discussed with students and Learning Assistants during focus groups to brainstorm potential interventions. As these interventions are designed, focus groups will be used to continually gain feedback and perspectives from students to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. The final phase will pilot, test, and evaluate the interventions. Results and findings from each phase will be disseminated to the mathematics and STEM education community to inform efforts to implement inclusive practices intended to lead to Black students feeling supported, acknowledged, and engaged. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many losses are rank-based, playing a critical role in applications like information retrieval, search engines, and recommender systems. They are also valued for training robust models capable of dealing with label noise, outliers, and imbalanced data. Decomposability is a key feature of these losses, allowing them to be broken down into individual components for efficiency and distributed computing. As a bridge between training data and the model, rank-based decomposable loss plays a vital role in machine learning, highlighting the need for thorough study. The project will explore rank-based decomposable loss from two perspectives: aggregate and individual losses. The aggregate loss is the loss over all training data and is constructed from the individual loss of the model for each data sample. The project will concentrate on several key inquiries: What are the general abstract formulations of the rank-based decomposable aggregate and individual losses for machine learning? How to efficiently optimize learning objectives formed based upon them while ensuring convergence? How can these losses be customized or modified to suit different machine learning problems? And what are the statistical behaviors of machine learning algorithms using these losses? The outcomes of this project will unearth new insights into established robust machine learning techniques and give the loss a new twist to consider ranks and decomposability.<br/><br/>This project will be conducted in two interrelated thrusts. The first thrust explores a novel and general rank-based aggregate loss for supervised learning. The focus will encompass efficient algorithms that can optimize this loss with guaranteed convergence, along with streamlined techniques to determine relevant hyperparameters. The developed loss will be connected with distributionally robust optimization to gain insights into its sample-level robustness and the development of new types of rank-based aggregate losses. Additionally, theoretical guarantees will be established for rank-based aggregate losses, including classification calibration, classification consistency, and generalization properties. The second thrust aims to study a general formulation of rank-based individual loss with theoretical analysis, bolstering label-level robustness in multi-class and multi-label learning scenarios. Furthermore, the use of rank-based individual loss will be expanded to tackle fairness learning challenges and investigate the resilience of models trained with this loss against adversarial threats, including verification and defense mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The GLaMP meetings are typically held over 3 days in June, with an attendance of 45-50 researchers.  The annual conference series, which began in 2016 at Michigan State, focuses on early-career mathematicians working in mathematical physics.  Each meeting features invited talks by experts in the field, a minicourse on a topic in mathematical physics, contributed talks by participants, and an interactive career development panel. The main goals of the GLaMP series are: 1) to provide a forum for early-career researchers in mathematical physics ? including advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and early-career postdoctoral scholars ? to present their research and enhance their career development; 2) to maintain communication and collaboration among scientists working in mathematical physics throughout the United States and, in particular, in the greater Midwest; 3) to encourage participation by women and underrepresented minorities in the field of mathematical physics; and 4) to raise the research profile of mathematical physics within the mathematical and scientific community of the United States. All details about the 2024 meeting and links to web pages of previous GLaMP meetings can be found at https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp/home. <br/><br/><br/>Mathematical Physics is one of the oldest scientific disciplines and is a very active field worldwide, with researchers working in both mathematics and physics departments. The roots of the field can be traced to the classical mathematics of Newton, Euler, and Gauss.  In the twentieth century, there were many developments at the boundary between mathematics and physics, for example, in scattering theory, non-relativistic quantum mechanics, constructive quantum field theory, the foundations of statistical mechanics, and applications of geometry and topology to high energy physics. The field is supported by the International Association of Mathematical Physics, which organizes an international congress every three years. Although there are many mathematical physicists working in the United States, there are few regular conferences representing the field in the US. The GLaMP meetings have evolved to be the main annual meetings focused on mathematical physics in the US.  Minicourse topics have included non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics, disordered quantum spin chains and many-body localization, non-self-adjoint operators and quantum resonances, the mathematics of aperiodic order, random matrix theory and supersymmetry techniques, quantum trajectories, and mathematical general relativity. Besides the location, we believe that the distinguishing feature of the GLaMP meeting is its emphasis on early-career researchers. The majority of contributed talks are given by early-career faculty, postdocs, and advanced graduate students. In addition to providing a forum that showcases the work of young researchers, the GLaMP meeting also offers career development opportunities, specifically through a three-hour mini-course on an active area of research given by a world-class expert and a career round table with panelists representing different career paths in mathematical physics, both in academia and in industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An essential requirement of radio astronomy service (RAS) is access to a spectrum devoid of radio frequency interference (RFI) from other sources. RFI can obscure faint astronomical objects, create false signals, reduce the sensitivity of radio telescopes, and lead to significant loss of data and bandwidth limitation. Traditionally, RAS operates in secluded regions, using the surrounding terrain to shield it from populated areas, or inside a radio quiet zone that enforces strict regulations on human-generated RFI. While these measures are effective in mitigating terrestrial RFI, such as TV/radio stations, mobile phones, and WiFi networks, they are unable to protect RAS against RFI originating from satellites in space. With an increasing number of mega-constellation satellites being launched into space by companies like SpaceX, satellite RFI presents a grave threat to RAS. On the one hand, it is imperative for satellite operators to cooperate, avoiding illuminating ground RAS receivers and minimizing the RFI. On the other, the RAS will have to strengthen its ability to operate amidst strong unavoidable RFI. By leveraging a novel modulo sampling approach, this project aims to develop cutting-edge circuit designs and signal processing algorithms that will bolster the resilience of radio telescopes against RFI. It holds great potential for optimizing the collection and processing of RAS data, while also fostering the coexistence of satellite communications and scientific research in the radio spectrum. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to enhance the operational capabilities of radio astronomy service (RAS) in the presence of strong radio frequency interference (RFI) arising from satellite transmitters that cannot be avoided geographically. To protect RAS systems electronically, a crucial step is to ensure the linearity of RAS receivers. Nonlinearity or saturation in receivers generates intermodulation products that can wipe out the entire observing band. It is costly to use conventional technologies, e.g., high-dynamic range (HDR) low-noise amplifiers and high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for amplification and digitization, to enhance the linearity of RAS receivers. This is because such enhancements can result in an avalanche of RAS data, which is known for its very large size. The proposed research takes a modulo sampling-based approach to operate radio interferometry robustly against RFI. Specifically, modulo sampling folds the out-of-range input signal to within the dynamic range before taking samples using a regular-resolution ADC. This allows the recovery of HDR information from low-dynamic range (LDR) measurements. Building on the modulo sampling approach, the proposed research encompasses three thrusts: (1) a signal processing framework for robust and super-resolution radio interferometry, which enables the receiver to operate without being limited by a fixed dynamic range; (2) scalable modulo ADC design for demonstration of unlimited interferometry capability in the presence of RFI; and (3) experimentation incorporating the modulo ADCs for comprehensive testing and evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately 20 rising juniors and seniors attending college/university in Washington, DC, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, many of whom are under-represented minorities, attend the Institute. The PSI has four overarching practical objectives: providing accessible and engaging overviews of the subfields and methods of the political science discipline; encouraging participants to conduct research and envision themselves as researchers; demystifying the processes of applying to graduate programs and pursuing a graduate degree; and elucidating the career paths open to graduates of doctoral programs in political science. In pursuing these practical objectives, PSI aims to accomplish two broader goals: empowering diverse cohorts of participants studying myriad pressing political topics to advance innovative research in new sites, using new methods, developing new theories, and generating actionable findings; and enhancing the diversity of the backgrounds and perspectives of the student population in political science graduate education, thereby contributing to creating a more diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. <br/><br/>PSI supports student participants to successfully apply to graduate school and provides them with the tools to excel in their graduate programs. The Institute thus contributes to broadening, deepening, and strengthening the pool of students applying to graduate programs, to boosting the acceptance rate of underrepresented students, and to augmenting the participation of historically underrepresented groups in STEM ? thereby fostering intellectual progress. Moreover, the systematic evaluation of the program allows advances in knowledge about key barriers to graduate education for students from historically underrepresented backgrounds; and the development of strategies and best practices for supporting students from these backgrounds, and for designing and scaling such initiatives across institutions, regions, and disciplines. This knowledge, in turn, will form a robust foundation for the development of evidence-led interventions aimed at enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the academy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematics behind origami, however, is not yet fully understood. In particular, some origami models can be folded and unfolded in such a way that we could make the crease lines be hinges and the paper between them stiff like sheet metal. Such models are called rigidly flexible origami and have applications that span the physical and biological sciences, ranging from unfolding solar sails to collapsible heart stents. This project will add mathematical tools that allow industrial applications to employ cutting-edge research, from large-scale architectural structures to nano-scale robotics driven by origami mechanics. The tools from this project will help design self-foldable structures. Currently self-folding designs in engineering, architecture, and the biological sciences involve building physical models in a trial-and-error approach, wasting time and resources. The self-folding research provided by this project will allow designers to avoid pitfalls and tighten the design-to-realization process significantly. In addition to the research component, the PI shall organize a diverse range of educational activities including in-service teacher training and education, undergraduate mentoring and preparation for graduate school; high-school and undergraduate classes on the mathematics of folding; for the public, general-audience articles, lectures, and exhibitions. This will increase interest in STEM fields through the fun, hands-on nature of origami while simultaneously disseminating project results.<br/><br/>The methods of this project involve a blend of practical experimentation with theory. Programmed self-foldability of structures will be achieved by trimming away undesired paths from the configuration space of all possible rigid foldings. One approach is to transform a given rigid folding of a crease pattern into a kinematically equivalent rigid folding with fewer degrees of freedom. The PI has proposed such a transform and will develop others. Key to all of this, however, is gaining a better understanding of rigid origami configuration spaces, which are algebraically complicated and not well understood. The project seeks to understand, and exploit, local-to-global behavior that is present in many known examples of rigid origami. In these examples approximating the configuration space near the origin (the unfolded state) leads to exact equations for the global configuration space. Formulating rigid origami configuration spaces in this way will add insight into the general field of flexible polyhedral surfaces, as well as provide the data needed to prove the feasibility of origami crease pattern transforms and design reliably self-foldable origami mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and ranks second in cancer death. In 2020, the estimated incidences of colorectal cancer were 1.9 million, and these are expected to increase 60% by 2030. Most colon cancer patients receive post-surgery chemotherapy (adjuvant therapy) to prevent cancer recurrence. Oxaliplatin is the most widely used chemotherapy agent in colorectal cancers to prevent recurrence, accounting for around 10% of all cancer patients. However, more than half of the patients do not benefit from oxaliplatin. Instead, oxaliplatin leads to disabling and lasting neuropathy that deteriorates the patient's quality of life and results in substantial financial burdens ($18,000 per patient per year) due to treatments for unnecessary side effects. Accurately predicting oxaliplatin benefits may enable oncologists to choose among Food and Drug Administration-approved regimens to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects by limiting oxaliplatin to patients who likely will benefit. This solution may improve the outcomes for colon cancer patients receiving post-surgery adjuvant therapy worldwide.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a machine learning model using the colon cancer transcriptome as an input feature to predict the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of colon cancer. Patients with resected high-risk stage II/III colon cancer usually receive a curative adjuvant chemotherapy to prevent recurrence. However, the chemotherapy, oxaliplatin, may lead to acute and chronic disabling peripheral neurotoxicity. The machine learning model was developed to predict the cancer cells? drug sensitivity based on patient?s individualized transcriptomic data. In an effort to de-escalate chemotherapy and avoid unnecessary side effects, clinical trials were conducted to examine whether a shorter duration can maintain efficacy and yet reduce oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity. The model, referred to as the colon oxaliplatin signature model, was shown to be predictive of oxaliplatin benefits in the colon cancer adjuvant setting in a double-blinded clinical trial of 1,065 colon cancer patients with both transcriptomic data and survival outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project continues work to understand geoscience boundary spanners who ?have a foot in both worlds? of mainstream geoscience and community. The project pursues a theory of change that place-based, community-based research, co-produced with boundary spanners, becomes a catalyst for cultural transformation in both the Geosciences and in community collaborations. Research questions examine the core leadership competencies that contribute to the application of leadership theory to boundary spanning work, and determine how a two-cohort Pathmaker and Changemaker model can actively engage power structures in mainstream science to effect meaningful institutional change.

It becomes increasingly essential to ensure fairness in AI algorithms to avoid amplifying inequalities and reinforcing existing prejudice. Although fairness algorithms have achieved great progress recently, when deployed in the real world, they still face practical generalization, privacy and robustness challenges. First, the fairness performance can be significantly degraded under distribution shifts such as domain and temporal shifts. Second, most previous fairness algorithms require direct access to the exact demographic attributes, which is usually infeasible due to people's awareness and legal regulations on privacy. Moreover, research indicates that addressing fairness may increase privacy leakage risks. Third, malicious actors can amplify the demographic bias of AI algorithms by injecting poisoning samples in the training stage or manipulating the data in the inference stage. The goal of this project is to investigate the impact of the aforementioned issues on fairness and develop effective solutions to ensure fairness under generalization, privacy and robustness challenges.<br/><br/>To achieve the research goal, the project systematically investigates the key directions of fairness under domain and temporal shifts, fairness faced with privacy mechanism enforcement and privacy leakage risks, bias amplification attack and defense methods. The project outcomes help advance state-of-the-art research on fair AI and introduce: (1) fairness in domain adaptation from an information-theoretical perspective and a meta-learning framework to ensure temporal-invariant fairness; (2) algorithms improving fairness performance under local differential privacy mechanism and achieving fair graph learning while minimizing the privacy leakage; and (3) poisoning and evasion attacks on fairness properties, as well as model-centric and data-centric defense methods for such attacks accordingly. More broadly, this project will have an immediate and strong impact on improving fairness algorithms in practices, enabling the responsible data analysis with advanced trustworthy AI paradigms in the real world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High entropy alloys (HEAs) are emerging as promising high strength and radiation-resistant materials as HEAs contain a mix of many elements that disrupt the chemical ordering. The focus of this research is to gain fundamental understanding at the atomic level on how the complexity of chemical disorder interferes with the formation and evolution of undesirable defects that weakens the material.  To gain these insights, state of the art analytical and imaging techniques will be used to reveal how an atomic sized defect in the material evolves and how the chemical disorder interferes and halts this undesirable process.  Such insights are needed to develop the optimal alloys with high radiation resistance, high strength and high stability that would not only enable new advanced power generating technologies with high efficiency and low or zero carbon emission but more generally, could transform many technical fields related to energy and space. Students working on the project will develop in-depth understanding on chemistry and physics of materials and defects in solids and gain experience in important techniques in material science. International student exchange and national internship opportunities are offered to the graduate students involved in the project. A wide range of research opportunities and outreach activities are provided to undergraduates and high school students throughout the period of the project where participation of underrepresented groups are actively encouraged. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>High entropy alloys (HEAs) are emerging as an outstanding class of materials due to their excellent mechanical properties and high radiation tolerance as a result of their unique electronic structure. Chemical disorder and compositional fluctuations in these alloys have large effects on energy dissipation and response to irradiation. While previous transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and other studies showed that damage accumulation was suppressed by increasing chemical disorder, they could not reveal vacancy clusters below 2 nm leaving critical gap in understanding defect formation and buildup in these alloys.  The proposed research aims to experimentally monitor defect formation on atomistic scale and their buildup to large clusters and voids by combining in-situ and ex-situ positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) with in-situ and ex-situ TEM to capture isolated vacancies, small vacancy clusters, larger clusters and voids, thus bridge the gap between the atomic scale and mesoscale characterization of radiation induced defects in HEAs. The use of In-situ PAS and In-situ TEM measurements both coupled with ion irradiation offers a picture of the defect dynamics including production, annihilation and evolution, on atomic scale (for PAS) and mesoscale (for TEM). The proposed research is expected to reveal the effects of chemical disorder on defect formation, migration and evolution in a radiation environment and reveal the damage and annealing mechanisms in Single -Phase Concentrated Solid Solution alloys (SP-CSAs) and HEAs through the study of defect production from collision cascades on an atomic and mesoscale level in alloys with increasing chemical complexity from one to five constituents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This digital convergence has opened new avenues for advanced analytics, providing valuable insights into various aspects of society, including a holistic understanding of crime dynamics. However, traditional crime analytics methods fall short in keeping up with the complexities of modern criminal activities. These methods are limited by their isolation and reliance on similar types of data and resources, making it difficult to adapt to our fast-moving, interconnected society. In response, our project presents a novel and comprehensive approach that transcends these barriers. By ensuring the protection of data and optimizing the efficiency of crime analytics processes, this project captures valuable information from diverse data sources, thereby facilitating a more robust understanding of crime patterns. The developed technologies from this research can be applied to many other fields such as healthcare, finance, and environmental monitoring. The project will integrate research with education and outreach to different groups including unrepresentative and minority students.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to enhance AI-driven crime analytics through the development of a federated meta-learning framework. This framework will facilitate efficient, private, and secure model training using multi-modal data. The initial research thrust focuses on creating a novel data labeling and rebalancing algorithm to promote fair model training across interconnected nodes, thereby advancing fairness in AI systems, while the integration of meta-learning during local model training tailors a proactive approach to alleviating computational burdens on individual devices, promoting practical efficiency. Building upon these foundations, the second research thrust emphasizes the handling of multi-modal data, showcasing the project's capability to navigate complexities within interdependent networks and effectively integrate diverse data sources.

About 40 million people in the United States rely on private well water for drinking and household uses. Often, this water is not monitored or treated like water distributed through public supply systems leaving private well users at an increased risk of exposure to chemical or microbial components that can trigger or exacerbate health problems. The changing climate happening across the US can negatively influence water quality for private well users. It is, thus, important to understand how climate and water-contaminating factors work together to result in well water that is unsafe to drink with the potential for serious health consequences. A location particularly hard hit by this phenomenon is the US Gulf Coast. To address the climate/well water safety problem, a broad network of scientists, health/medical professionals, and other stakeholders in the Gulf Coast have created a Private Water Well Research Coordination Network. This network connects researchers and stakeholders across the well water ecosystem to enable a multi-pronged concerted effort to identify problems and possible solutions/interventions needed by those relying on private wells for drinking water. Goals are to help well owners and others understand the causes, health implications, and risks of consuming contaminated water and how to know if well water is compromised. The network will create public education and outreach materials; devise well water mitigation and improvement strategies; and develop means for alerting well users of declines in water quality due to climate-driven events such as salt water intrusion, flooding, and sewage/animal waste pond overflows. The network will create and disseminate best practices in water quality monitoring to help keep private well water safe. To accomplish these goals, the network holds regular virtual meetings that include strategy sessions, collaboration discussions, and planning of research agendas that include participation by geoscientists, health/medical professionals, and community/civic entities. The network is focused on actionable results, ones that align with high priority water-well user needs. Broader impacts include improved quality and safety of private water wells, production of educational materials to help better ensure safe well-derived drinking water, improved health of those relying on private well water, and means by which well owners can determine whether their water is safe to drink. Additional impacts include developing connections between geoscientists and health/medical practitioners, as well as addressing a serious problem in a number of EPSCoR states (Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi) across the South.<br/><br/>Access to safe and sustainable drinking water is paramount for human health and well-being. Approximately 15% of the US population relies on private drinking water wells that do not adhere to approved drinking water standards or require monitoring and treatment that is done for municipal supplies. Private well users must act as their own water utility, assuming the responsibility for maintaining a safe water supply. Climate change, including salt water intrusion into coastal aquifers and water wells, drought that increases the concentration of toxic metals and/or organic/biological agents in groundwater, and flooding which can contaminate well water with bacteria and microbes from sewer outflows or livestock manure containment ponds. All have the potential to seriously impact the health of private well users. However, there is limited information for this segment of the population on how to understand and monitor water safety from phenomena driven by climate change at the timescale on which water safety is defined. The Private Water Well Research Coordination Network serves this pressing need and provides a coordinated and holistic joint geological and medical research effort to understand the interplay of social, demographic, and environmental factors that lead to and can compound negative health effects of drinking water from private wells. While this challenge is not limited to the US Gulf Coast, the focus of this network is on that region due to is particular vulnerability to climate change and growing population. The network involves development of a long lasting, dedicated network of geoscientists, medical/health professionals, state geological surveys, universities, land grant university extension agents, and other stakeholders. The network is broad and covers a geographic region that spans from Arkansas, across the southern Gulf Coast states to the Atlantic Ocean. Committed network members meet regularly, form teams around specific perils to Gulf Coast well water users, develop joint projects for funding by various entities, and work with community and civic organizations to prepare educational materials that disseminate information on practices that can help to ensure safety or private wells used for drinking water. They also devise means that can alert users when their well water could be compromised to help prevent serious health issues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conversely, they are less likely to entrust an AI with tasks that require intuitive and emotional intelligence, perceiving the technology to be very limited in those aspects. While machines have their shortcomings, humans do as well. Studies reveal that human novices and experts are both susceptible to judgment weaknesses, such as attentional and confirmation biases, that result in inconsistent decisions. Consequently there is a move towards building human-AI collaborations that can improve decision-making. Achieving higher utility with human-AI collaborations than with AI or humans alone is challenging. This project addresses several of the challenges by aligning the goals and activities of the human and AI participants through a shared mental model of the task.   This will foster more accurately calibrated trust, and thus enable sound augmenting of human judgment in risky settings.  The principals and methods developed will be applied to financial fraud risk assessment. The project aligns with the goal of enabling human-technology partnerships that augment performance. It includes outreach activities to foster an interest in science and technology research among undergraduate students. It also involves auditors and forensic experts to cultivate lifelong learning on AI-human partnerships. <br/><br/>This project draws from team decision-making theory, which suggests that effective team performance requires members to hold a common or overlapping representation of the task requirements and procedures, referred to as a shared mental model. The shared mental model includes the knowledge or belief about causal relationships.  The mental model will capture the human decision-makers' and AIs' perceived relationship between the cues in a company's data and fraud risk. The model will be informed by the human decision-makers' perception of risk and their process in ascertaining risk arrived at by analyzing behavior of the  human expert interacting with visual data displays during risk assessment.  It will incorporate AI feedback to the human decision-maker during risk assessments to enhance the team's performance.

For example, analyzing vehicle trajectories from surveillance videos is essential for improving traffic safety. This project introduces a novel method for querying movement patterns in videos, enabling users to sketch events of interest on a canvas. The main innovation lies in accurately and efficiently matching free-form sketches to real-world trajectories, overcoming challenges posed by ambiguous user intent and variations in perspective, orientation, and camera movements. Consider a user describing a left-turning vehicle event as a 90-degree angle from a top-down perspective; in practice, the turning angles may appear different on video due to varying camera positions relative to vehicles. The project will lead to an open-source video database featuring a sketch-based query interface, making the analysis of movement patterns in videos more accessible and accurate. Research findings will be disseminated through publications at top conferences and incorporated into new database courses at Georgia Tech, as well as research classes for Atlanta-area high school girls interested in pursuing computing careers. <br/><br/>Video retrieval from trajectory queries has been explored by the database and machine learning communities using SQL-like and natural language interfaces, but they face limitations due to high query specification time or poor generalizability to unseen videos. This project seeks to address these challenges by introducing a novel visual query paradigm that enables users to sketch exploratory trajectory queries in video analytics through drag-and-drop actions. The project is structured around two research thrusts. The first focuses on developing a human-in-loop similarity search framework that leverages active-learning techniques to solicit user feedback. This process aims to clarify user intent in query specifications and address inaccuracies inherent in human sketching. Domain-specific knowledge will be incorporated as additional predicates in the pre-processing and post-processing stages of similarity search to further enhance retrieval efficiency and quality. The second thrust develops an end-to-end machine learning model that learns a robust similarity measure between user-drawn sketches and trajectories in real-world videos, accounting for variations in camera angles and movements. It will address the lack of diverse and labeled datasets for video retrieval from trajectory queries by developing a self-supervised learning framework based on trajectory simulation. Overall, this project will leverage database-style optimization to reduce both user effort and computational resources required for utilizing vision models in exploratory video analytics, which will help expand the adoption of video analytics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The GRS (July 13-14) will provide a forum for postdocs and graduate students to present their work and discuss new ideas in the field, and it will include a career mentorship panel. The goal of the GRS is to contribute to the advancement of scientific discovery in RNA biology by creating a collegial, inclusive, and trainee-focused environment to facilitate both scientific and career development of attendees. The five-day GRC program (July 14-19) will include talks from trainees, early stage, and senior scientists in RNA biology, all of whom are at the cutting-edge of the post-transcriptional gene regulation field. In addition, the GRC will include a Power Hour that specifically addresses issues related to increasing participation and retention of broad and diverse talent in STEM fields. Attendance at the GRC and GRS will be capped at 200 and 70 attendees, respectively. This small conference size will help to ensure that there is ample opportunity for open discussion and meaningful interactions among the participants that propel new insights into post-transcriptional gene regulation.<br/> <br/>All organisms respond to their environment and maintain normal cell behavior through post-transcriptional gene regulation. By regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally through RNA splicing, 3 end formation, RNA stability, etc., cells establish the proper gene expression patterns required for any given environment. Thus, an understanding of these mechanisms in RNA biology is essential to define both normal and disease states and will be important in developing therapies. For example, the recent history of COVID19 mRNA vaccine development exemplifies how the fundamental RNA biology that drives posttranscriptional gene regulation can broadly impact the human condition. An in-depth understanding of posttranscriptional gene regulation was required for the development of mRNA vaccines. The scientific programs at the Post-Transcriptional Gene Regulation GRC and GRS address cutting-edge topics in the field, including RNA modifications and structure, RNA and disease, and noncoding RNA, among others. Importantly, the science that will be presented at the GRC/GRS is expected to be unpublished work, so that the conferences stimulate discussions on novel ideas and emerging questions, and thus catalyze scientific advances in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach based on the historical record that traces data from its original source to its current location (called data provenance analysis).  Securing endpoint computers is a vital component of enterprise security. Current solutions adopt a strategy for detecting attacks by comparing endpoint activity to a set of detection rules that describe common attack behaviors. However, this is an error prone practice, leading to large volumes of false alerts while failing to detect sophisticated attacks. In addition, the maintenance requirements of investigating these false alerts pose a formidable challenge within smaller to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which lack the necessary security resources and personnel. This impediment is even more visible within SMBs housing sensitive user data, where a security breach can have profound and enduring financial and societal consequences. This technology may be used to establish data provenance analysis as a more precise and practical means of detecting attacks on endpoints. In addition, this solution may save U.S. companies millions of dollars by thwarting attacks that could have otherwise resulted in the compromise of customer data.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of analysis of data provenance to ensure cyber security. Data provenance techniques incrementally parse individual endpoint events (e.g., process executions and file accesses) into a causal dependency graph that describes the history of system execution. The graphical representation of endpoint activity highlights the relationships between objects, making it easier to identify suspicious activities. A key finding of this research is a method of overcoming the inherent architectural limitations in the machine learning models used to analyze data provenance graphs. Leveraging this method, a model was trained that comprehensively captures the typical behavior of programs by associating them with their full historical context. Attacks are detected by comparing suspicious programs to the models? expectations of each program?s behavior, which is informed by the programs? provenance. This approach significantly reduces the occurrence of false alerts when compared to current endpoint security solutions, while also eliminating the need for frequent system tuning such as the adding and removing of detection rules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NIST has recently selected four algorithms for standardization and has chosen three other algorithms as potential candidates. However, these algorithms are not without vulnerabilities, and the majority are susceptible to both certain types of cyber attacks and environmentally induced faults. Such vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and system failure. This project aims to perform a rigorous evaluation of the PQC algorithms and to design, simulate, and implement tailored countermeasures against these threats. This cutting-edge research will be incorporated into graduate-level courses.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance the field of PQC by performing a detailed analysis of existing algorithms, identifying vulnerabilities to SCAs, and formulating countermeasures against such attacks and environmentally induced faults. Due to the complex nature of deriving such techniques, software simulations will need to be done to verify these mathematical derivations. Following rigorous software simulations, these countermeasures will be integrated into the original hardware architectures such as FGPA or ASIC to assess their real-world overheads, with a focus on compatibility with deeply constrained embedded systems prevalent in the military, governmental, and commercial sectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This bridge, being a part of the I-695 beltway, lacks convenient detour options. Thus, its collapse leads widespread disruptions in mobility that affected not just the immediate vicinity but also resonated throughout the broader DC-Maryland-Virginia region. The objective of this project is to methodically gather time-sensitive data on traffic flow and community responses in the wake of this event, providing a detailed assessment of its repercussions. Moreover, this incident also brings a major disruption to freight transportation and supply chains on the East Coast. Given the reliance of freight models on occasionally collected, often proprietary data from commodities surveys, state reports, and customs statistics, this study aims to fill these gaps through an integrated approach for critical trucking, maritime, rail, and supply-chain data collection. These efforts are essential for enhancing the resilience of transportation networks and supply chains against future disruptions. For a broader audience, all the collected data will be made publicly available while carefully following rules for privacy protection and existing data usage agreements. Through sharing detailed findings and facilitating a broader understanding of the incident?s impacts, this project aspires to foster a more informed and prepared society, capable of effectively navigating the challenges posed by major infrastructural failures and their far-reaching impacts on communities and economies.<br/><br/>The catastrophic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, has precipitated significant disruptions across urban transportation networks, due to the lack of convenient alternative routes, affecting daily commutes for an estimated 34,000 individuals. Moreover, the collapse introduced considerable logistical difficulties, particularly in the Port of Baltimore, a critical national and international trade node. Research completed for this project aims to develop a comprehensive data collection methodology, incorporating data integration and enhancement through existing data platforms (e.g., augmentations in commuting, trucking, rail, and marine traffic data alongside social media analytics), comprehensive surveys (e.g., examining travel behavior, community impact, and economic repercussions), and targeted interviews (e.g., exploring governmental responses and adaptations within the logistics network). Should initial analyses indicate a necessity, the spatial and temporal scope of data collection may be expanded to evaluate the impact of the bridge collapse comprehensively. This project is dedicated to improving data transparency and utility, employing elaborate documentation and a diversified strategy for data dissemination, including the development of a dedicated project website, utilization of the NSF NHERI Data Depot for data storage and dissemination, conducting workshops to engage a wide array of stakeholders, and presenting the data architecture at major transportation, infrastructure systems, and disaster conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will accomplish this goal by developing education pathways that enable STEM majors to be trained and licensed to teach. High-quality STEM teachers can inspire the next generation of scientists to use scientific tools and methods to solve societal problems. Furthermore, training STEM teachers is crucial for meeting targets of national scientific advancement. Unfortunately, current approaches to training, recruiting, and retaining STEM Educators have yielded mixed results. An overlooked aspect of this problem is the conflicting identities between STEM and education programs. STEM teachers may feel conflicted between the cultures of these programs as they transition from preparation to practice.<br/><br/>This capacity building project at Harding University includes partnerships with Searcy, Bald Knob, and Riverview Public School Districts. The project goals include leveraging the theoretical foundations of identity theory and professional learning communities to build a degree program that will nurture an integrated STEM teacher identity. These project goals will be accomplished by building a professional learning community of relevant stakeholders to guide the creation of a novel STEM degree plan that bridges the identity gap between teacher preparation and STEM disciplines. The professional learning community will assess stakeholder needs and identify available capacity and the capacity lacking at Harding University for completing the project goals. The project will employ quantitative and qualitative techniques to obtain and analyze data from 550 - 600 STEM teachers, high school seniors in STEM courses, STEM college faculty, and other relevant stakeholders. Further, the project will document the findings that inform partnering school districts about STEM Education and be evaluated by an external evaluator. This project is well-positioned to provide a model for assessing the potency of using a professional learning community to drive identity integration that strengthens the pathways between STEM disciplines and teacher preparation. The knowledge uncovered through this project can influence practices in teacher preparation and hopefully bring them into closer alignment with real-world changes in STEM. This capacity building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Thus, it is a region that is vulnerable not only to anthropogenic climate change but also to direct human impacts. The proximity of the region to multiple international research stations operated by Antarctic Treaty member states makes it accessible to a significant number of scientific visitors each year. Moreover, anticipated increases in the number of commercial vessels operating in the Ross Sea may open the region to a greater number of tourist visits. Thus, it is necessary that scientists, logistic contractors, and managers operating in the region convene regularly to assess the state of the environment and define best practices that will maintain the nature of the area. International workshops addressing environmental management of McMurdo Dry Valleys region have been held in 1991, 1995, 1998, and 2016. The participants of these workshops were drawn from multiple national science programs, tour groups, logistics coordinators, and environmental consultants. This workshop will be the fifth in the series and aims to assess the efficacy of ongoing environmental practices, their influence on the environmental integrity of the region, and develop greater coordination among international Antarctic scientists and logisticians in efforts to update best practices for minimizing the impacts of human activity in the McMurdo Dry Valleys on the unique biological communities, geologic formations, and historical structures.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>This international workshop on McMurdo Dry Valleys stewardship will address action items raised by previous workshops and make recommendations for future scientific, management, and logistical activities in the region. In the eight years since the most recent workshop the area has been challenged by aging infrastructure at McMurdo Station and field camps in the region, the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing urgency for scientists to assess their own environmental impacts, the potential for increased tourism, and dynamic changes in climate. Thus, it is important now that a fifth workshop be convened to assess the efficacy of ongoing environmental practices, their influence on the environmental integrity of the region, and update an international plan for documenting and minimizing broader environmental impacts. This workshop will also investigate impacts such as fuel use, energy efficiency of infrastructure, waste generation, and other contributions to carbon emissions, which were not included in prior workshops. This workshop aims to increase coordination among National Antarctic Research Programs in ongoing efforts to update best practices for minimizing scientific and tourism impacts on the McMurdo Dry Valleys and the unique biological communities, geologic formations, and historical structures located there.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the moon?s shadow sweeps across the contiguous United States, it provides a natural laboratory to study the ionosphere?a partially ionized region of our atmosphere that plays a crucial role in radio communication, navigation, and space weather. During a solar eclipse, the reduction in solar radiation leads to a decrease in ionization. The investigators plan to take advantage of the upcoming solar eclipse in 2024 through coordinated multi-instruments observations of ionospheric parameters. The proposed work will deepen our understanding of the chemical and dynamical processes in the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system. Such events impact the plasma density, which adversely affects High Frequency (HF: 3-30 MHz) propagation and communication signals. While the macroscopic effects on the IT response are well understood, the detailed features controlling the ionospheric density including the transport in the F-region and topside ionosphere remain unclear. The project will strengthen collaborations with the citizen science community, support two early-career scientists and an undergraduate summer student. This project benefits society by improving communication reliability, enhancing space weather predictions, and supporting education and diversity in STEM fields.<br/><br/>One of the main objectives of the proposal is to understand and quantify the relative importance of external forces on the ionospheric density responses to the October 2023 and April 2024 solar eclipses as observed by HF sounding and compare the findings with the August 2017 solar eclipse. The proposal will focus on the following scientific topics: 1. Quantification of Eclipse-Driven Ionospheric Changes: the project seeks to understand how solar eclipses impact the ionosphere's electron density. It plans to investigate variations in the F-region height (HmF2) and the occurrence of the ionospheric G-condition (where NmF1?NmF2), (2) Identification of Controlling Factors: By analyzing data from ground-based HF facilities, the researchers will quantify the relative importance of various factors in determining the ionospheric responses, including reduced EUV Flux, thermospheric winds, photoelectron transport and heating. The proposed scientific investigation involves the use of the SuperDARN, the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter Radar (MHISR), and HamSCI HF observations.

Geometric measure theory studies the geometric properties of sets and measures under transformations. Fractal sets, or sets with highly irregular geometry, are of particular interest in this regard. Recently, the connection between Fourier analysis and geometric measure theory has led to substantial progress in both fields. This project explores the interaction between these two fields, along with possible applications to other fields such as dynamics and number theory. The project also supports workshops for graduate students and early-career mathematicians: these events will promote mathematical expertise within the indicated research areas, will contribute to the professional training of participants, and will foster new research collaborations.<br/><br/>The project combines work in restriction theory (within Fourier analysis) and the theory of projections (within geometric measure theory). One component of the planned research involves the study of the mass of a function, with Fourier transform supported on the sphere, on a fractal set.

However, automation of multiple critical care treatments presents unique challenges.  Each treatment given to a patient elicits multiple physiological changes.  Thus, when multiple isolated automated treatments are given to a patient, they can conflict and drive the patient to unsafe physiological states.  Regardless, most previous work has neglected such conflicts.  To address this challenge, we will develop innovative mathematical algorithms to enable safe automated patient monitoring, treatment guidance, and reconciliation of potentially conflicting medical treatments.  We will achieve this goal by leveraging and advancing theory of control, inference, and optimization, thereby creating new knowledge in these fields.  Successful completion of this project will lead to new approaches to the coordination and mediation of complex interacting automation systems, including healthcare and medical systems.<br/><br/>This project brings together the (cyber) disciplines of data science and control theory, in support of safe and conflict-aware automated treatments in the (physical) discipline of patient therapeutics.

We will demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework using a complex critical care resuscitation application as a compelling case study.

The current undergraduate engineering curriculum continues to use the old model in which students take the same courses, in lockstep, regardless of individual interests or strengths, to produce interchangeable graduates. This project intends to demonstrate the feasibility of developing and implementing a more flexible, customizable curriculum, by modularizing the first-year engineering courses at the University of Cincinnati. Specifically, the project plans to disassemble the two existing courses into smaller modules and create additional options for topics. Although some modules will be required of all students, students should be able to select among the other modules to pursue their own interests and customize their pathways. The intent of this modularized curriculum is that it be more focused on the needs of the next generation of the engineering workforce by moving beyond the model of interchangeable parts from the industrial revolution to a responsive system that accepts customized components to address societal challenges. A key deliverable will be a toolkit that documents administrative and logistical issues with potential solutions and identifies supports that are helpful for faculty and students in engaging with a modularized curriculum.<br/><br/>In addition to developing, implementing, and evaluating modules on a variety of introductory engineering topics, the project intends to conduct research centered on constructs that have become more prominent in the engineering education literature, namely students? mental health well-being, and how the implementation of the first-year program can positively or negatively influence individual student wellness. Considering how students manage emotions and stressors including self-reported stress, anxiety, and depression, and different student social identities and perceptions of inclusion the project intends to study how the design of the first-year engineering experience impacts how first-time-in-college and transfer students navigate the curriculum and ultimately complete their degrees, including academic outcomes and affective outcomes. The research will use an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, a quantitative phase followed by a qualitative phase, which will be repeated with each cohort of students (approximately 1500 students per cohort). To understand the population-level impact of the curricular change, the project intends to analyze year-over-year college-level retention data. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to these unique characteristics, dental studies have provided much information about past human and non-human primate (NHP) populations. In addition to the information about diet, behavior and health, teeth?s external morphology (shape) has been extensively analyzed in studies of lineage evolution and population relatedness. These studies rest on the idea that tooth development and resulting tooth morphology are under strong genetic control. However, morphological variation of teeth is high, and for many dental morphological traits the assumption of strong genetic control remains untested. This study advances knowledge about external and internal tooth morphology using non-invasive techniques in primate skeletal collections.  The project supports students and scholars at different stages (postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students), and includes outreach activities directed to K-12 students in Puerto Rico and New York. Leveraging partnerships between the local clinical community and the University of Arkansas? Predental Studies Program, this project also benefits society by providing research training and professional development opportunities to aspiring dentists. <br/><br/>Analyses that infer evolutionary relatedness assume that dental traits faithfully relay genetic lineage information. But this assumption has yet to be empirically tested in many dental morphological traits. This study measures variation at the outer enamel surface, enamel-dentine junction, root, and pulp chamber in two NHP (M. mulatta, S. fuscicollis; N=550). Using paired microCT and pedigree data, this project takes a quantitative genetic approach to answer the following questions: (1) To what degree is dental morphometric variation (across distinct teeth and tissues) influenced by genes?; (2) What environmental factors impact tooth form throughout development?; (3) To what degree are tooth characters genetically correlated (influenced by the same genes)?; and (4) Does dental genetic architecture differ across taxa? By generating novel heritability, evolvability, and genetic correlation estimates, this project provides insights into the driving mechanisms of dental variation and how genes are recruited throughout development to influence distinct tooth structures. This information is essential to ground truthing the use of teeth for reconstructing evolutionary processes and experiences of stress and illness. The study is innovative in its incorporation of internal morphology, the use of non-destructive techniques, and its detailed examination of distinct moments in the development of internal and external dental morphology. The study contributes over 1,000 high-resolution scans and 3D surface models of skulls and teeth, extending curation of analyzed skeletal collections and enhancing teaching and research infrastructure through open-access digital archives.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biological Anthropology Program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the SBE Postdoctoral Fellowships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Every experiment, every analysis, every collaboration entails embarking on a path whose destination is uncertain and whose terminus could be a dead end. Yet, not all projects are equally risky. In choosing what to work on, scientists have the latitude to embrace or avoid.  Appropriately high risk can bring high return, while excessive caution hampers scientific progress.  Thus, scientists and the public alike have an interest in encouraging researchers to pursue suitably risky projects, yet investigators often shy away from taking the big risks that may generate the most productive science. This project unpacks the incentives that investigators face when choosing how much risk to take on in their scientific careers.  The project illuminates why researchers may shy away from the most promising but risky ideas, and asks how scientific norms and institutions can be modified to motivate researchers to pursue the most promising ideas while still protecting their livelihoods from the vicissitudes of scientific chance.  This understanding can help accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, enhancing the public?s return on its investment in scientific research.<br/><br/>The researchers develop, analyze, and communicate mathematical models of how scientists balance the competing incentives and constraints that they face when constructing and pursuing their research programs.  These models apply the tools of economics and decision theory to the practice of scientific research, and blaze new ground by focusing specifically on scientists? risk-taking and its consequences for scientific debate and the formation of scientific consensus.  One component of the research examines how scientists? tradition of preferentially publishing successful projects encourages or discourages risk-taking, and how alternative models for scientific publication might shift scientists? tolerance for risk.  A second component builds on recent mathematical developments in the theory of imprecise probability to develop a more expansive view of how scientists navigate the thick uncertainty that defines work at the scientific frontier.

The deformation can be elastic, so that when the force is removed the material recovers its original shape. Alternatively, the deformation can be plastic, whereby the material undergoes irreversible changes that may subsequently lead to breakage. Many materials of technological importance exhibit a combination of these two types of deformation depending on the applied force, and are called elasto-plastic. One example are bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are alloys that have an amorphous atomic arrangement in contrast to most metals. BMGs have desirable properties, such as the ability to be processed like plastics, making them attractive candidates for many applications (e.g. next-generation smartphone cases) due to considerable improvements in manufacturing efficiency. However, experimental measurements of BMG breakage properties show wide variations, limiting their usage. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop predictive theoretical and computational models of BMG elasto-plasticity. This project is based on a surprising similarity between the equations for elasto-plastic materials and the equations for incompressible fluids. Using this similarity, computational approaches that were originally developed for fluid flow will be translated to elasto-plasticity. These computational methods will be used in collaboration with theorists and experimentalists to study the fracture properties of BMGs. The ultimate aim is to provide a practical engineering tool for predicting when elasto-plastic materials will break, and how to best design structures using them. This work will be undertaken as part of an integrated program of research, teaching, and mentorship, and will involve outreach activities in New England, including a local library lecture series.<br/><br/>The projection method of Chorin (1968) is a well-established approach for simulating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. This proposal is based on a surprising mathematical correspondence between fluids in the incompressible limit and elasto-plastic solids in the quasi-static limit (when inertia can be neglected). In this proposal, this correspondence is harnessed to translate several modern numerical approaches derived from Chorin's projection method to quasi-static elasto-plasticity, resulting in a practical and powerful set of new simulation tools for a different class of physical problem. Compared to existing techniques, the resultant numerical methods are likely to be especially well-suited to problems involving large plastic deformations. An example type of elasto-plastic material are the bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are alloys with many favorable properties such as excellent strength and wear resistance. The numerical methods developed here will be used in a collaboration with theorists and experimentalists to study the fracture toughness properties of BMGs, with the aim of predicting BMG toughness over a wide range of experimental conditions. The PI plans to expand the graduate curriculum in numerical methods to address a pressing need in this area.

Enclaves can enforce a variety of security policies such as always erasing sensitive data after use. However, using enclaves requires greater programming expertise and this limits their wide-spread adoption.  This effort advances the state-of-the-art for building secure systems by automatically placing the security-critical parts of an application inside enclaves, reducing the challenges for the programmer.  We will implement this system to support modern application platforms that often distribute application processing across multiple platforms, for example, an application that runs on an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) and also on data center servers in the cloud to which the ATM is connected.  This project includes education and mentorship of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Language-based security mechanisms?such as the security type systems for information-flow control? can express and enforce security requirements at the application-level. However, the security guarantees enforced by the language-based security mechanisms break down in the presence of powerful<br/>low-level attackers that are not bound by the language-level abstractions, for example, attackers that are capable of injecting arbitrary code to extract secrets. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)?such as Intel SGX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone, and Sanctum ? offer strong architectural protection mechanisms for isolated execution and remote code attestation. To this end, they provide isolated regions of memory, referred to as enclaves, that offer confidentiality even in the presence of a privileged kernel-level attacker. Our work aims to enforce expressive security policies using secure TEE enclaves. First, we propose to build a compiler for LLVM intermediate representation that automatically infers enclave regions and enforces application-specific security against powerful attackers. The inferred enclave regions will then be translated to machine-specific TEE instructions. We plan to support multiple backends (e.g., Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone). Second, we propose to build DFLATE, a system with distributed enclaves that offers robust confidentiality and integrity guarantees with respect to an expressive security specification. Notably, DFLATE supports security policies that involves principal groups (e.g., reading a secret requires the permission of both Alice and Bob). We propose a novel approach to use advanced cryptographic techniques such as threshold encryption and ring signatures to implement such group-level policies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the moon?s shadow sweeps across the contiguous United States, it provides a natural laboratory to study the ionosphere?a partially ionized region of our atmosphere that plays a crucial role in radio communication, navigation, and space weather. During a solar eclipse, the reduction in solar radiation leads to a decrease in ionization. The investigators plan to take advantage of the upcoming solar eclipse in 2024 through coordinated multi-instruments observations of ionospheric parameters. The proposed work will deepen our understanding of the chemical and dynamical processes in the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system. Such events impact the plasma density, which adversely affects High Frequency (HF: 3-30 MHz) propagation and communication signals. While the macroscopic effects on the IT response are well understood, the detailed features controlling the ionospheric density including the transport in the F-region and topside ionosphere remain unclear. The project will strengthen collaborations with the citizen science community, support two early-career scientists and an undergraduate summer student. This project benefits society by improving communication reliability, enhancing space weather predictions, and supporting education and diversity in STEM fields.<br/><br/>One of the main objectives of the proposal is to understand and quantify the relative importance of external forces on the ionospheric density responses to the October 2023 and April 2024 solar eclipses as observed by HF sounding and compare the findings with the August 2017 solar eclipse. The proposal will focus on the following scientific topics: 1. Quantification of Eclipse-Driven Ionospheric Changes: the project seeks to understand how solar eclipses impact the ionosphere's electron density. It plans to investigate variations in the F-region height (HmF2) and the occurrence of the ionospheric G-condition (where NmF1?NmF2), (2) Identification of Controlling Factors: By analyzing data from ground-based HF facilities, the researchers will quantify the relative importance of various factors in determining the ionospheric responses, including reduced EUV Flux, thermospheric winds, photoelectron transport and heating.

These systems are everywhere in our daily lives, for example, found in foods, consumer products, coatings, adhesives, and pastes (e.g., 3D printing).  These systems are also common in biological fluids (e.g., mucous, blood, bacterial suspensions).  One interesting feature of viscoelastic suspensions is that particles in such fluids acquire lift forces during pressure-driven flows that drive them toward specific regions in the fluid.  This phenomenon is important in polymer processing because it determines the final structure of the materials.  It is also important in microfluidic technologies where flow is used to separate biological suspensions by particle size and shape.  While the lift forces are well-studied for spherical particles, little is known about how particle shape affects the lift because the phenomenon is highly coupled to the particle orientation, which itself is a function of the flow. This award will perform experiments, simulations, and theories to characterize the motion of non-spherical particles in polymeric fluids and quantify the coupling between the lift and orientation for different flow rates, particle geometries, fluid properties, and channel confinement. This information is valuable for processing rod-like and disk-like particles in viscoelastic suspensions in the applications mentioned above, as it provides design guidelines for the migration time and final location for different particle shapes.<br/><br/>This study specifically will perform microfluidic experiments where one flows a dilute suspension of spheroids (prolate and oblate) through a tube. Different fluids and channel sizes will be used, allowing one to systematically vary the fluid properties and channel confinement.

These areas struggle the most to attract and retain skilled STEM educators, often resorting to substitutes or teachers lacking proper qualifications. To tackle this, the project offers financial aid, an accelerated path to teacher certification, and innovative strategies tailored for students in these underserved settings. Prospective teachers can pursue a math or science degree while undergoing intensive STEM teacher training, leading to a swift pathway to teacher certification. This comprehensive initiative targets recruiting STEM majors interested in teaching, providing them with specialized training in STEM content, teaching methodologies, and increased practical experiences to better equip them for the classroom and to enhance STEM education overall.<br/><br/>This project at The University of West Alabama (UWA) includes partnerships with a two-year institution; Coastal Alabama Community College; as well as collaborations with rural high-need K?12 school districts, University Charter School and Sumter County School District both located in the highly impoverished Sumter County, Alabama. The project's overarching goals encompass 1) recruiting and certifying 29 new STEM teachers over five years from UWA's math, science, and computer science programs; 2) fostering a highly supportive atmosphere for aspiring educators, through mentorship by esteemed UWA?Teach expert faculty, and 3) implementing an induction program for continued development of subject matter comprehension and pedagogical practices. The project employs a mixed methods research methodology, combining quantitative data from surveys and databases with qualitative insights from semi?structured interviews. Key research questions include assessing the impact of project experiences on UWA STEM majors' interest in teaching in underserved schools and their efficacy in engaging with K?12 students from these communities. Additionally, it examines the project's success in enlisting and retaining scholars and fellows, striving for an 80?90% completion rate in meeting STEM certification requirements. Likewise, it investigates the perceived effectiveness of the induction program for its graduates. Employing a responsive evaluation model, the project adapts to evolving needs by continuously gathering and analyzing data, enabling annual reporting and necessary program adjustments. The intellectual merit lies in the model of best practices developed for recruiting, educating, and supporting STEM teachers as they face the everyday challenges that plague underserved schools. The broader impact aims to elevate future generations by producing more qualified STEM teachers willing to serve in underserved schools, ultimately enhancing the education of children who often lack access to well?qualified educators. Subsequently, the expectation is that the number and caliber of students entering postsecondary institutions as STEM majors will increase, initiating a positive and sustainable cycle of support for STEM education. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K?12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K?12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high?need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K?12 STEM teachers in high?need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This solution is based on the development of a verified train protection system. Train protection systems safeguard railroad operations by keeping motion within a safe envelope. These systems decide when to slow trains down to avoid collisions with other trains, stay inside movement authorities, and navigate slopes, curves, and tunnels safely. The technology is a train protection system that is formally verified, meaning that it is mathematically proven to be safe, with computer-checked proofs, ensuring high levels of safety and reliability. The current approach to ensuring train software reliability is to run extensive tests and simulations. However, these methods can check only a finite number of scenarios out of the infinite possibilities, forcing conservative engineering decisions. In contrast, these proofs give a stronger guarantee of correctness by checking safety in many more possible cases. The resulting verified train protection system technology provides a safe path to deploy new technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will be made of a recyclable material (aluminum) or ceramic with a new environmentally friendly working fluid inside.

CLPHPs provide a direct replacement for existing vapor chamber, heat pipe, and heatsink solutions for these devices.  The main deliverable is to develop an industry-leading heat spreader- that operates passively, creating its coolant flow from its self-pulsating mechanism, critical for thin mobile electronics for which fans or other auxiliary powered non-passive solutions are avoided. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to address the urgent cooling challenges presented by next-generation 5G/6G mobile devices and other advanced electronics (Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things) for which a solution has yet to be found. The objectives are to build on the fundamental and practical knowledge developed in the Phase I project to geometrically enhance the micro-channels to increase the internal surface area, the evaporation and condensation processes, and the flow rate to achieve even greater heat-spreading capability.  This will be accomplished through fabricating and testing two novel CLPHP designs (generations 2 and 3) under various heating conditions and orientations representative of mobile device applications.  The goal is to enter the market with this disruptive cooling technology that will enhance the performance of millions of mobile devices, save battery/grid energy, and unlock the barriers created by today?s lack of advanced cooling solutions.  The novel CLPHP is an important ?enabler? of numerous new devices yet to be conceived and for improvement of existing advanced technologies, nearly all of which are electronically ?throttled? by the limiting performance of current cooling technologies.

For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. <br/><br/>This project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  <br/>1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?<br/>2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?<br/>3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?<br/>4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?<br/><br/>The team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.  For the EMIC waves in the outer magnetosphere, the team will also investigate space (MMS, THEMIS, and Cluster)-ground conjugate observations using high-latitude ground stations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central challenge is to classify all maps from spheres to other spheres, where two maps are considered equivalent if one can be deformed to the other. The equivalence classes of these maps are called the homotopy groups of spheres, and collectively they form one of the deepest and most central objects in the field. Historically, much important theory has arisen out of attempts to compute more homotopy groups of spheres and understand patterns within them. This project involves furthering knowledge of the homotopy groups of spheres, using old and new techniques as well as computer calculations. The project also involves studying an analogue of these groups in algebraic geometry; this falls under a relatively new and actively developed area called motivic homotopy theory, which applies techniques in algebraic topology to study algebraic geometry. The broader impacts of this project center around supporting the local mathematics community through mentoring and promoting diversity. The principal investigator will help build the nascent homotopy theory community at the university and promote women and minorities in the subject through seminar organization and mentoring.<br/> <br/>One of the main planned projects is a large-scale effort to compute the homotopy groups of spheres at the prime 3 in a range, using old and new techniques such as the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence as well as infinite descent machinery. This work will be aided by computer calculations, which short-circuits some of the technical difficulties encountered in previous attempts. Another main group of projects concerns computing the analogue of the stable homotopy groups of spheres in the world of R-motivic homotopy theory. This represents a continuation of prior work of the PI and collaborator; the plan is to supplement the techniques used in that work with computer calculations and a new tool, the slice spectral sequence.

The project advances biosensors from inherently planar to tubular and curved environments. It will allow the systematic study of the individual and combinatorial impact of biochemical stimuli, local curvature, and stiffness on the function of live cells in tubular environments. Insights from this work will be useful in diverse fields, including in situ biosensor design for real-time measurements in living systems, biofilms, and organ-on-chip models of environmental exposures and disease modeling.<br/>	<br/>Strain produced by curvature has a pronounced effect on cellular behavior, and fluid flow can be significantly different in tubes with rectangular vs. circular cross-sections. Hence, developing tissue-engineered models for tubular ducts, especially at sub-millimeter diameters, is a critical yet unmet challenge in cell biology and bioengineering. This proposal aims to combine biosensor integration and cell biology expertise to create anatomically relevant tubular cellular biosensors with tunable dimensions and cellular characteristics. Complex and anatomically relevant cell-laden tubes will be mass-produced using accurate alignment and layering of cells and matrix, along with functional biosensors based on electrical readouts. Tubular and curved integrated electroanalytical sensors include electrochemical and biochemical sensors that measure the effects of the physical and chemical variables on cellular function. New integrated biosensor platforms will be developed as model systems to interrogate cell behavior in response to biochemical stimuli in anatomically relevant microenvironments. Studies will include comparisons of cell function in varying curvature vs. planar geometries, which is vital for addressing unanswered questions on the role of geometry in the microenvironment on fundamental cell biology and biomedical engineering. The broader impacts of the proposal include integrating principles of 3D biosensor integration and the effect of geometry on living systems into educational curricula and K-12, undergraduate and graduate STEM training, and research experiences.

In the US, breast cancer patients show a high incidence of lymphedema in their arms. The goals of this CAREER project are to comprehend the regulation of the lymphatic structure and function in breast cancer and to discover novel approaches to treating lymphedema linked to breast cancer through the establishment of a unique cell culture platform dedicated to studying lymphatic drainage in breast cancer. This project may contribute to the development of new therapies benefitting millions of lymphedema patients and enhancing health outcomes in the US. Educational initiatives involving Cornell and local high school students are aligned with the research goals. The recruitment and training of a diverse group of underrepresented undergraduate students will be carried out through Cornell Engineering Learning Initiatives and the Prefreshman Summer Program. Collaborations with New Visions Engineering and the Cornell Science and Technology Entry Program will further engage disadvantaged high school students in hands-on activities related to lymphatic research. Additionally, the project's educational program will create online courses to raise scientific awareness of lymphatic diseases.<br/><br/>Lymphedema, characterized by swelling due to impaired lymphatic drainage, affects over 150 million patients worldwide. Despite its prevalence, there is no FDA-approved treatment, and commonly used conservative therapies provide primarily palliative relief. This CAREER project seeks to investigate the mechanisms of lymphedema, identifying potential therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. While genetic defects can cause primary lymphedema, secondary lymphedema, particularly breast cancer-associated secondary lymphedema, is more common. However, the mechanistic understanding of breast cancer-associated secondary lymphedema is currently limited. The lack of experimental models for normal and impaired lymphatic drainage has been a significant obstacle. The principal investigator addresses this challenge with a microfluidic culture model featuring an engineered lymphatic vessel that mimics key lymphatic endothelial cell-cell junctions. These junctions are crucial for facilitating lymphatic drainage and allow for the study of how they are affected in conditions such as breast cancer. The project extends this work by creating tissue-engineered co-culture models replicating the breast tumor lymphatic microenvironment. These models involve culturing multiple breast tumor cells and lymphatic cells in a well-defined three-dimensional space outside living organisms. A pilot study revealed that triple-negative breast cancer cells impact lymphatic structure and function, leading to impaired drainage. The research is organized into two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on understanding the regulation of lymphatic junction structure and drainage function in breast cancer and Aim 2 centers on the treatment of breast cancer-associated secondary lymphedema. In conjunction with educational outreach, this CAREER project will contribute to the development of new therapies for lymphedema patients in the US and will enhance scientific awareness of lymphatic disease and microphysiological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All cells today are connected to the first cell that emerged several billion years ago, through the continuous events of cytokinesis. Despite this continuity, the mechanisms of cytokinesis as seen in today?s animals, plants, and prokaryotes appear unrelated without underlying principles, because most cytokinesis research has focused on a small number of organisms and cell types. As a result, we currently lack insights into the evolution of cytokinesis mechanisms. In this project, we will address the current knowledge gap and inherent bias in our understanding of cytokinesis by using the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Chlamydomonas, divides by ingressing the plasma membrane like animals, yet it lacks the canonical animal cell-division machinery. Its division involves a hybrid of plant-division machinery and other components conserved in many eukaryotes, including humans. Furthermore, Chlamydomonas possesses a single chloroplast, which must be divided and segregated into daughter cells in coordination with the cell division process. Chloroplasts derive from a cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryote and became a stable endosymbiont, and therefore possess their own division machinery of bacterial origin. Thus, by investigating cytokinesis and its coordination with chloroplast division in Chlamydomonas, this project will elucidate (i) the ancestral and fundamental mechanism of cytokinesis that is conserved in the majority of eukaryotes and (ii) the communication between the eukaryotic and bacterial division systems crucial for the establishment of endosymbiosis and subsequently the maintenance this essential organelle for photosynthesis. The Broader Impacts of the work include the intrinsic nature of the research as all cells undergo the process of cytokinesis.  In addition, the project will provide research opportunities to high school students and their teachers, and educate undergraduate and graduate students about the current bias in the use of model organisms and the potential future opportunities emerging models can bring.<br/><br/>The overall research goals of this project are to elucidate (i) the mechanism of actomyosin-independent, microtubule-dependent cleavage-furrow ingression in Chlamydomonas and (ii) the role of actin cytoskeleton in the spatiotemporal coordination of cytokinesis and chloroplast division. To this end, one part of this research will address how microtubules are organized at the division site using light and electron microscopy, and investigate the mechanisms of augmin-mediated formation of furrow-associated microtubules by genetics and proteomics. In another part, the project will investigate how nuclear-encoded proteins required for chloroplast division are transported to and translocated into the chloroplast in an F-actin-dependent manner, and identify novel genes and proteins involved in chloroplast division through genetic screens and proximity-based proteomics. Identifying the actomyosin-independent mechanisms of cleavage-furrow ingression is critical to elucidate the generalizable, fundamental rules governing the seemingly diverse and specialized modes of cytokinesis found across the eukaryotic tree, as well as to understand how these modern cells evolved from the ancestral ones that did not have an actomyosin ring. This research is also relevant to investigating the evolutionary events in early eukaryotes, because spatiotemporal coordination of division is a critical step in endosymbiosis between an ancestral eukaryotic cell and a cyanobacterial cell. Chlamydomonas provides an excellent system to fill these gaps in our current understanding. This project represents a crucial paradigm shift in the existing literature and classroom education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To ensure that they operate in a safe manner, it is therefore important to formally verify the underlying code. However today, tools for verification, execution and simulation of cyber-physical systems are largely disconnected, and difficult to reconcile. As a result, formal verification often ends up verifying a model of the code rather than the code that is actually executed, creating a gap in the verification. The project creates MARVeLus, a programming language unifying verification, execution and simulation of cyber-physical systems. The project's novelties are to bridge the gap between verification, execution and simulation, to offer a methodology for end-to-end verification of cyber-physical systems, and to ensure that the code that is executed is also the code that was verified. The project's impacts are to empower tomorrow's engineers to design cyber-physical systems with strong, formally verified guarantees applicable to real-world systems, and to democratize the use of formal verification in the design of cyber-physical systems. The investigator maintains strong ties with industry, which facilitates industry evaluation and feedback. The project also includes a collaboration with a Detroit-area Title 1 middle school to make the students aware of safety issues in engineering.<br/><br/>The difficulty to achieve verification, execution and simulation together stems from multiple fronts: the intricacies of the semantics of languages for cyber-physical systems, including machine arithmetic; the complication of modeling and communicating with sensors and actuators; and the challenges in accurately modeling, simulating and proving properties about continuous dynamics, especially when coupled with discrete programs. To resolve those challenges, the project models cyber-physical systems as hybrid systems, with both discrete and continuous dynamics. MARVeLus is first designed as a synchronous language, in the tradition of languages such as Lustre, Esterel and Signal. Synchronous languages are stream-based languages built around a synchronous clock and targeted to cyber-physical systems and embedded systems. They come with strong runtime and memory guarantees. By building MARVeLus on a synchronous platform, we leverage their success based on decades of research, and encourage industry adoption. Second, MARVeLus enables verification through refinement types and an external Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver. The project builds a dedicated refinement type system to reason about different properties of hybrid systems, including safety and liveness. Third, the project adds ordinary differential equations to the synchronous language, inspired by the recent development of the synchronous language Zelus. The project builds refinement typing rules allowing the user to reason about those differential equations using explicit solutions and invariants. Finally, the project performs verified simulation by formally verifying numerical algorithms approximating differential equations, and formally bounding their errors. As a result, MARVeLus is a synchronous language with differential equations and refinement types, with a verified simulation capability. The project applies and evaluates the design of MARVeLus on a small ground robot and a quadcopter in the laboratory, on the industrial aircraft collision avoidance system ACAS X.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An accurate assessment of its quantity and quality is a persistent global and national challenge, particularly in transboundary regions. This project seeks to improve our understanding of groundwater dynamics and achieve integrated water balance parameterization at fine spatial and temporal scales. The results will be especially useful to Ukraine, where the limitations of the ground observation network require more efficient assessment techniques based on remote sensing. To build algorithms and models for accurate and timely aquifer assessment, this project will bring together researchers from six countries: the United States, Ukraine, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The robust international collaboration at the core of this effort, bridging distinct transboundary human systems and connected natural aquifer systems, will accelerate progress that no single discipline or nation could achieve alone. Simultaneously, this project will foster the next generation of research leaders and support the co-development of a modern innovation ecosystem in Ukraine.<br/><br/>This project will pioneer a comprehensive transdisciplinary approach to fine-scale modeling of surface water and groundwater interactions in a transboundary setting.

Although this practice is associated with low- and medium-income countries, open dumping and burning of waste also occurs frequently in the United States in remote, rural locations, or isolated Native American communities. These disposal pits are an overlooked source of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in underserved and remote communities. In open burning pits, plastics are partially burned and generate MPs and NPs with different chemical and physical properties compared to plastic particles that are produced via other weathering processes such as abrasion. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to investigate the reactivity, transport, and environmental impact of thermally oxidized (burned) MPs (1 micron to 5 millimeters) and NPs<1 micron) in soils nearby open waste dumping and burning sites. Building upon preliminary data showing that burned MPs/NPs release more dissolved organic carbon into aqueous media than unburned plastic particles, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to test the hypothesis that changes in the functional chemistry and bulk physical structure of thermally oxidized MPs/NPs will affect their reactivity, transport (e.g., leaching/sorption) and environmental impact in aqueous media and soil matrices. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of fundamental knowledge to address a critical knowledge gap about the reactivity, transport, and environmental impact of burned MPs and NPs in underserved and remote communities that utilize open dumping and burning pits to dispose of their waste. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student and one undergraduate student at Oklahoma State University.<br/><br/>Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) generated from the open burning of solid waste contain more oxidized functional groups compared to unburned plastic particles. This CAREER project will evaluate the reactivity and transport of partially burned (thermally oxidized) MPs and NPs in environmental aqueous media and soil matrices and their impacts on key soil biogeochemical processes. The specific objectives of this research are to 1) evaluate  the release of dissolved organic carbon and additives from partially burned MPs/NPs into environmentally relevant aqueous media; 2) evaluate the sorption and transport of plastic additives and partially burned MPs/NPs in soils; and 3) determine the effect of partially burned MPs/NPs on key soil biogeochemical processes including oxygen utilization, methanogenesis, and denitrification.

Protein synthesis in the Bacteroidia differs substantially from that of well-studied bacteria, such as Escherichia coli. This project will uncover the unique way in which proteins are made in the Bacteroidia. The knowledge gained in this work may spur advances in biotechnology and medicine, particularly with respect to antibiotic development and human microbiome function. This project will also have broader impact by providing (i) research training for undergraduate and graduate students and (ii) summer research opportunities for local high school students (Columbus Public Schools).<br/><br/>The textbook model of translation initiation in bacteria entails base pairing between a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of mRNA and the anti-SD (ASD) element of 16S rRNA. In Bacteroidia, virtually all mRNAs lack a SD sequence even though ribosomes of these organisms carry an intact ASD. Recent structural studies explain the basis of this apparent paradox. The 3? tail of 16S rRNA is sequestered in a pocket formed by ribosomal proteins bS21, bS18, and bS6 on the 30S platform, an interaction which occludes the ASD. In the rare cases when SD elements are present, this interaction allows SD to be used for regulatory purposes (one such case is autoregulation of bS21 production), but generally it may enhance initiation on SD-less mRNAs in these organisms. Bacteroidia ribosomes also contain a novel protein, bL38, whose function remains unclear. This project aims to elucidate unique aspects of protein synthesis in the Bacteroidia, using Flavobacterium johnsoniae as a model. Specifically, the work will address: (1) how the platform pocket contributes to translation initiation in F. johnsoniae; (2) what role bL38 plays in F. johnsoniae, and (3) whether bS18-depleted ribosomes regulate protein synthesis in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a member of order Bacteroidales.

A delivery system that can more accurately navigate to the subretinal space has the potential to more safely and efficiently deliver and accurately position a stem cell sheet (or other therapeutic medium) in the eye. Accurate and safe delivery could lead to improvements in retinal degenerative diseases (which affect over 400 million people worldwide) making the procedure simpler and faster.

CoQ is insoluble in water, and its functions rely on its presence in the membrane.  CoQ must be transported from the mitochondria where it is made, to other membranes throughout the cell. Cells are also able to take up CoQ from outside the cell and transport it to membranes within the cell.  Such movement of CoQ restores energy production and antioxidant protection to cells.  However, the mechanisms responsible for such CoQ movement remain mysterious.  In this project investigators have identified three proteins that play crucial roles in CoQ movement to where it is needed.  One of these proteins binds tightly to CoQ to help it move, and this project will identify how this CoQ ?chaperone? protein works with other proteins in the cell components to enable CoQ function.  The investigators will also characterize two other proteins they discovered that are essential for correct movement of CoQ.  Elucidating the functional roles of these three proteins will advance our understanding of how CoQ is transported throughout the cell. This project will also train graduate and undergraduate students as researchers. Graduate students will teach and mentor undergraduate students, who are active participants in the scientific discoveries.  Students will appreciate that there are many unsolved problems in membrane formation and movement within the cell, including routes yet to be discovered. Students will present their research findings at local conferences and at national and international meetings. <br/><br/>     Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is a hydrophobic lipid molecule essential for mitochondrial respiratory energy metabolism.  It also serves as a vital antioxidant that protects cellular membranes from lipid peroxidation.  CoQ is synthesized within the inner mitochondrial membrane and must be trafficked to non-mitochondrial membranes.  CoQ-deficient cells supplemented with exogenously supplied CoQ are able to take up this insoluble lipid and transport it from the plasma membrane to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it restores the function of respiratory electron transport.  However, the pathways that mediate the intracellular distribution of CoQ remain poorly understood. In order to advance our understanding of CoQ trafficking, this project will characterize three proteins essential for the intracellular distribution of CoQ in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The investigators will determine the structure of Coq10, a CoQ-binding protein conserved from yeast to humans.  A mixed-vesicle fluorescence-based assay that detects movement of CoQ between vesicles will be used to assess the activity of the Coq10 polypeptide as a CoQ transporter.  The project also aims to determine the function of conserved catalytic residues in Coq11.  Evidence suggests that Coq11 modulates the mitochondrial CoQ pool and hence, its intracellular distribution.  The investigators also discovered that Vps1 is required to mediate CoQ transport.  A panel of vps1 mutants with defects in specific functions that affect membrane fusion, fission, and endomembrane trafficking will be used to identify the functional role(s) of Vps1 important for CoQ transport.  This project will advance our understanding of how CoQ, and other hydrophobic molecules, are transported throughout cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reductive nickel enzymes are critical in the metabolic processes of diverse microorganisms and perform valuable reactions such as hydrogen production, carbon dioxide reduction, and methane oxidation. These efficient, complex enzymes operate with high rates and full reversibility but have yet to be accurately reproduced in synthetic systems, leaving many questions unanswered. To better understand native nickel enzymes and learn how to harness this understanding for anthropogenic processes, the Shafaat group will model the nickel-iron hydrogenases using a robust, protein-based scaffold. The proposed studies on the engineered enzymes are aimed at the elucidation of the reaction mechanisms along with the identification of the key factors along the entire protein contributing to catalysis. The research provides insight into how natural enzymes function across a range of length- and timescales. Graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, including those from underserved communities, will be trained in state-of-the-art research techniques spanning biological, inorganic, physical, and analytical chemistry. This award also supports the development of lectures and hands-on exercises to train members of the broader bioinorganic community who attend the internationally recognized, biennial Penn State Bioinorganic Workshop. This project will be integrated with outreach programs spanning multiple age groups in greater Central Ohio. <br/><br/>This project seeks to address critical knowledge gaps about the naturally occurring nickel-iron hydrogenases and related nickel-thiolate enzymes through the development and characterization of a model hydrogenase enzyme, namely nickel-substituted rubredoxin (NiRd). Prior work supported by the NSF in the Shafaat group has established that NiRd is a functional mimic of hydrogenase that exhibits high rates for hydrogen evolution. In the proposed work, spectroscopic techniques, including electron paramagnetic resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, resonance Raman, and X-ray absorption, coupled with electrochemical methods, will be employed to obtain high-resolution mechanistic information and to reveal molecular-level contributors to hydrogen evolution activity.  These studies will provide detailed insight into the layers of control exerted by the protein scaffold in both model and native metalloenzymes.  The goals of the work are to identify correlations between enzymatic structure and function and to advance our understanding of biological hydrogen conversion.  The research seeks also to identify design principles for highly active artificial metalloenzymes, with long-term implications for the development of sustainable catalysts for small molecule activation reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This bias can be due to several reasons including biases in data, algorithmic biases, and biases in human interpretation. To mitigate this effect, one needs to better understand the learning procedure, especially when popular deep learning models are employed in order to aid decisionmakers in making fair machine decisions. Moreover, in sequential decision making setups, it is important to consider the long-term impact of automated decisions on fairness. This proposal aims to tackle the fairness challenge in machine learning by focusing on the effect of different biases on a deep learning model, as well as being cognizant of the long-term effects of fairness. The project engages undergraduate students in research and has several outreach activities involving pre-college students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop theoretical frameworks for studying how data biases impact the fairness of learning-based decision-making algorithms in both static and dynamic settings. First, the effect of data imbalances on the geometry of models learned by deep neural networks when various training loss functions are utilized will be investigated. Building on the theoretical framework, principled algorithms will be designed that provably enhance fairness in decision making. Finally, models will be developed that tackle the challenge of guaranteeing fairness in dynamic settings where group imbalance and feature distributions evolve over time depending on the decisions.

There is tremendous need for the Passive Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (POAWRS) technology implemented with coherent hydrophone arrays, which are underwater microphones designed to detect and analyze sound in water.  The system will have diverse applications like ocean environmental assessment and monitoring before, during, and after wind farm installations.  These applications include offshore hydrocarbon prospecting, biological and ecosystem scientific experimentation, coastal and maritime security, and offshore recreational activities, such as whale watching and fishing. The POAWRS technology is like satellite remote sensing. The breadth and depth of coverage from POAWRS has potential to revolutionize ocean sensing, making the ocean transparent so that discoveries are made more efficiently with informed decisions for sustainable use and stewardship of the oceans. Coherent hydrophone array technologies reside in the domain of large defense contractors, and this project aims to make the technology more affordable and available to the U.S. blue economy, commerce, academia, security, ocean management and conservation.<br/><br/>This project will translate the POAWRS technology for commercialization by developing two versions that are compact, energy efficient, cost-effective and user-friendly. The first example will be a stationary, 3D, coherent hydrophone array system suitable for installation on a fixed platform, such as a wind farm. The second example will be a compact, towable, 1D, coherent hydrophone array for deployment on a wide range of ocean vessels.

This process and the deployment of data-centric technologies have recently brought unprecedented advances in many scientific fields, as well as increased global prosperity with the advent of knowledge-based economies and systems. At a high level, this revolution is driven by two thrusts: the modern technologies which allow for the collection of complex data sets, and the theories and algorithms we use to make sense of them. That said, and for all its benefits, extracting actionable knowledge from data is difficult. Observations gathered in uncontrolled environments are often high-dimensional, complex and noisy; and even when controlled experiments are used, the intricate systems that underlie them --- like those from meteorology, chemistry, medicine and biology --- can yield data sets with highly nontrivial underlying topology. This refers to properties such as the number of disconnected pieces (i.e., clusters), the existence of holes or the orientability of the data space. The research funded through this CAREER award will leverage ideas from algebraic topology to address data science questions like visualization and representation of complex data sets, as well as the challenges posed by nontrivial topology when designing learning systems for prediction and classification. This work will be integrated into the educational program of the PI through the creation of an online TDA (Topological Data Analysis) academy, with the dual purpose of lowering the barrier of entry into the field for data scientists and academics, as well as increasing the representation of underserved communities in the field of computational mathematics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Understanding the set of maps between topological spaces has led to rich and sophisticated mathematics, for it subsumes algebraic invariants like homotopy groups and generalized (co)homology theories. And while several data science questions are discrete versions of mapping space problems --- including nonlinear dimensionality reduction and supervised learning --- the corresponding theoretical and algorithm treatment is currently lacking. This CAREER award will contribute towards remedying this situation. The research program articulated here seeks to launch a novel research program addressing the theory and algorithms of how the underlying topology of a data set can be leveraged for data modeling (e.g., in dimensionality reduction) as well as when learning maps between complex data spaces (e.g., in supervised learning). This work will yield methodologies for the computation of topology-aware and robust multiscale coordinatizations for data via classifying spaces, a computational theory of topological obstructions to the robust extension of maps between data sets, as well as the introduction of modern deep learning paradigms in order to learn maps between non-Euclidean data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there have been previous efforts to improve physics education, few have investigated disabled students? experiences in undergraduate physics contexts. As the number of disabled students continues to increase in STEM, it is important both to support these disabled students in their STEM career paths and provide professional development for physics faculty about how to support disabled students in their courses and programs. To that end, this project will develop professional development experiences for both physics faculty and disabled STEM students that focuses on 1) promoting accessibility and inclusion in undergraduate physics courses and 2) facilitating mutually beneficial partnerships between disabled STEM students and physics faculty. The professional development efforts will support faculty in developing inclusive teaching practices and will support disabled students in navigating future STEM careers. The project will investigate the impact of this professional development effort, which could be a model for other institutions and STEM disciplines. Ultimately, this project aligns with NSF?s strategic goal to empower STEM talent to fully participate in science and engineering through the strategic objective of ensuring accessibility and inclusivity.<br/><br/>To investigate the effectiveness of this professional development model, this collaborative project between Michigan State University and University of Connecticut will address three research questions: 1) How, and to what extent, do participating faculty develop fluency and improve knowledge in disability, accessibility, and inclusivity? How, and to what extent, do faculty implement changes and inclusive practices in their own classrooms? 2) How, and to what extent, do participating students develop fluency and improve knowledge in career readiness, available career paths, and job application processes? How, and to what extent, do students feel empowered to address ableism within the STEM community and career contexts? 3) How do participating faculty and students view their partnership during and after the workshop, and how does this partnership affect them as individuals? These research questions will be answered using qualitative methods, including interviews with participants and document analysis of workshop materials, as well as quantitative surveys to assess participants? views and knowledge of disability in physics. From results from these studies, the project will advance knowledge about partnership-based professional development models in undergraduate STEM education, both improving access and inclusion in undergraduate physics settings as well as laying the foundation for future professional development efforts focused on accessibility and inclusion in undergraduate STEM education more broadly.

For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. <br/><br/>This project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  <br/>1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?<br/>2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?<br/>3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?<br/>4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?<br/><br/>The team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.

An additional focus of the hub's work is also to ensure access and inclusion while addressing changing learning needs. Over five years, Education Northwest, in partnership with Washington State, will reveal new and actionable information about low-income students in STEM and how publicly funded housing, health, and human services programming can address their needs. The Hub will bring together diverse STEM stakeholders across sectors to move from data to action, changing how practitioners and policymakers think about broadening supports for low-income students to improve their STEM enrollment, retention, and completion. The Hub will also model how other states (and the federal government) can think about using data to improve STEM success for low-income students.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to increase degree completion of low-income undergraduates in STEM fields. This project aims to uncover aspects of low-income students? lives that are often invisible to the college faculty and staff members who support them.

Their locomotion addresses unique constraints including surface waves, splashing, and reduced force production in air, which is a thousand-fold lower density than water. These behaviors present unique design opportunities for underwater vehicles, with applications including water-to-air take-off, maneuvering, and near-surface station-holding. Despite the prevalence of these biological examples, new information is needed about how bioinspired flapping propulsion performs while partially submerged. This work focuses on understanding the influence of the water?s surface on partially submerged propulsive performance. Beyond underwater vehicles, this work also helps explain the biomechanics of near-surface locomotion and aquatic jumping. This project will train an interdisciplinary team of undergraduate students in hands-on research problem solving. The project will also support a bioinspired design workshop for undergraduate anthropology and design students and an engineering workshop for women high school students in Southern California.<br/><br/>This work experimentally investigates the roles of and interactions between the free surface and propulsor flexibility during partially submerged bioinspired flapping. Specific objectives are to determine: (1) How propulsive performance scales with the size and speed of the surface disturbance created by the flapping motion. (2) How the free surface deforms during partially submerged flapping motions, including the effects of flexibility on the surface behaviors observed. (3) How three-dimensionality, including finite widths, spanwise bending, and surface disturbances, affects partially submerged propulsive performance. Combined, these objectives provide new understanding about the role of the free surface in partially submerged propulsion. Objectives will be addressed by testing flexible plates that are simultaneously flapping and traveling vertically out of the water. Key variables include flapping frequency and amplitude, vertical velocity, plate stiffness, and aspect ratio. Multi-axis force and torque measurements will facilitate comparisons of thrust and efficiency. Performance trends will be scaled based on the size and speed of the surface disturbance, in addition to parameterizations based on the flapping kinematics. To explain performance trends, high-speed imaging will visualize the free surface dynamics (including air cavity and wave formation, splashing, and the extents of the disturbance) and particle image velocimetry will be used to compare wakes. For cases where performance differs between aspect ratios, 3D imaging of the propulsor shape will be leveraged to explain these observations. Additionally, the project will contribute to open-access tools for volumetric flow imaging, with materials publicly disseminated through an open-source project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim is to move away from traditional road assessment methods and provide a system that is autonomous, continuous, and objective. This new assessment technology has the potential to save billions in road maintenance costs but also may significantly enhance public safety by enabling quicker responses to emerging road issues.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of an integrated pavement assessment system that utilizes autonomous sensing, machine learning, and large-scale data interpretation for intelligent condition assessment of roadways. By leveraging a network of low-cost mobile sensing agents, the technology collects real-time, high-resolution data on pavement conditions, that, when analyzed through artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, yields an assessment of roadway health. The technology merges several fields including the Internet of Things (IoT) for deploying the swarm of sensors, AI for interpreting the massive data sets collected, and crowdsourcing to augment the data gathering process. This approach may allow for a shift from schedule-based maintenance to condition-based maintenance, enabling quicker responses to road wear and potential issues, thus enhancing public safety and potentially saving billions in road maintenance costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Billions of users, including drone applications, precision farming, and The Department of Defense rely on GPS. Unfortunately, GPS signals are weak because they are transmitted from space, making them susceptible to jamming and hacking. Research from the scientific community has studied the use of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite signals as a backup to GPS.  This project will deploy a novel platform for testing theoretical studies and required infrastructure that will enable the use of LEO satellite signals by vehicles to improve their navigation systems. Improving drone navigation technology will push several markets into full fruition, including drone package delivery and delivery of emergency medical supplies, which are projected to see double digit market growth over the next few years. Precise positioning is also expected to support fully autonomous tractors, which will boost the agriculture market by scaling precision seed laying. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers 13 of the 16 critical infrastructures to be critically dependent on GPS.  This project aims to remove this single point of failure from over-reliance on GPS.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will develop a ground network service that supports the use of existing and future LEO satellite signals for positioning and timing to serve as an alternative or complement to GPS. The research objectives are to: 1) complete a proof-of-concept system enabling the use of these signals for positioning and timing, 2) analytically characterize performance of the system, and 3) demonstrate an operational proof-of-concept system in a region of the United States.  To reach these objectives, this project will leverage fundamentals from signal processing and estimation theory to convert LEO signals into GPS-like signals. Convex optimization theory will be used to guide the deployment of the infrastructure needed to realize the system. The demonstration of the system will be evaluated by comparing the mean and standard deviation of the position errors produced by the LEO satellite signals with theoretically achievable values.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The relative movement of an electrically conducting fluid (e.g., liquid metal coolant, saltwater, ionized gases, or plasmas) in a magnetic field is important as it has many applications in, e.g., nuclear reactors, artificial suns to produce carbon-free electricity, artificial hearts, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pumps, and geomagnetic dynamos. The accurate numerical simulation of the interaction between the velocity field of the fluid and the magnetic field is often computationally challenging, arduous, and prohibitively expensive even with the use of an advanced computing facility. This is because the two fields are non-linearly coupled. Moreover, many practical flows occur in a convection-dominated regime and their numerical simulations using standard algorithms produce numerical instability. The scenario is exacerbated by the presence of noise in the input data. The involvement of input uncertainties reduces the accuracy of the final solutions. Therefore, it is important to develop long-range high fidelity numerical algorithms for simulating such a complex problem. First, this project will investigate efficient ensemble schemes for simulating incompressible flow problems (without the presence of a magnetic field). Second, this project will focus on understanding the numerical instability and develop robust, efficient, and accurate algorithms for simulating complex flow problems where velocity and magnetic fields interact. This project will facilitate the teaching and training of students from underrepresented groups to pursue their careers in STEM fields. This will be carried out by supporting and supervising undergraduate and graduate students' research in numerical analysis and scientific computing.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to understand the numerical instability in the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of Navier-Stokes (N-S) and MHD flow simulations. The objective of this project is to develop, analyze, and test robust, and efficient novel algorithms of N-S and MHD flow ensembles simulations. The first research goal is to develop and investigate an efficient Stabilized Penalty-projection Finite Element Method (SPP-FEM) for the UQ of fluid flow simulations. The SPP-FEM is presented in an elegant way that at each time-step, it permits a shared system matrix for each realization in conjunction with a stabilized penalty-projection step. It is conjectured that the scheme will be unconditionally stable with respect to the time-step size and would be much faster and more computationally efficient than standard numerical methods. The second research goal is to develop a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) stabilized Evolve-Filter-Relax Stochastic Collocation ROM (EFR-SCM-ROM) algorithm to deal with the numerical oscillations, which commonly arise in ROM of the UQ of MHD flow ensembles. The EFR-SCM-ROM algorithm approximates the randomness of the parameters using stochastic collocation methods (SCMs) and uses a high-order ROM spatial differential filter in conjunction with an evolve-then-filter-then-relax scheme to attenuate the numerical oscillations of standard ROMs. The new EFR-SCM-ROM framework yields accurate approximations, minimizes the sensitivity of noise in input data, and uses rigorous error estimates to determine practical parameter scaling. The SPP-FEM and EFR-SCM-ROM algorithms are innovative and considered novel approaches, which will enrich and revolutionize the computational methodology and platform for the numerical approximation of MHD flow ensembles. These studies will advance the knowledge base in the field of MHD flow ensembles and other fields of multi-physics problems, including Boussinesq systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With this EAGER project the researchers pursue fundamental understanding of a clean energy technology for the extraction of lithium during recycling of lithium-ion batteries. Over the coming decade, many batteries necessary for electrification and the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy powering our lives will reach the end of their service life. These batteries will need to be sustainably and economically recycled to extract their valuable critical materials. One critical component in batteries is lithium, and this project focuses on the selective and efficient extraction of lithium from spent lithium-ion batteries. The United States has limited domestic lithium supplies, and thus capturing lithium via battery recycling is important both to reduce the environmental impacts of mining new lithium and providing a robust supply of domestic lithium. Investigating the recycling of lithium-ion batteries has inherent benefits to society. Additionally, workforce development is a crucial outcome of this project: as part of the project undergraduate and graduate students are trained in critical mineral recovery technology.<br/><br/>With funding from an EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award through the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative, the principal investigators develop an understanding towards a new approach for recovery of lithium during recycling of lithium-ion battery cells. Their new method has advantages relative to more mature battery recycling technologies in that it operates at low temperature, which reduces energy input intensity and the emissions required to produce the process energy. Also, the process can be applied to selectively extract lithium, but not other cell components, allowing other more mature technology for later stage processing if desired. The process can be applied broadly to a diverse set of different electrode materials and is therefore adaptive to changes in lithium-ion chemistry with time. The net chemical inputs per battery material processed is expected to be low. The system relies on a chemical redox step where the spent battery electroactive material is oxidized using a dissolved redox shuttle within a nonaqueous electrolyte solution. This redox shuttle is then regenerated electrochemically in a cell, and the lithium is selectively transported for further downstream processing towards battery grade recycled products. The focus of this project is advancing the fundamental understanding of two critical components in the process. The first component involves chemical oxidation for lithium release from electroactive materials. Chemical oxidation experiments provide quantitative insight into how these reactions proceed in a lithium extraction process for the diverse materials used commercially in lithium-ion batteries. The expected outcomes drive broader process design and inform downstream processing inputs. The second component involves selective electrochemical recovery of lithium from nonaqueous fluid. Selective lithium recovery in an electrochemical cell requires materials that are uniquely suited to this application that are stable in the electrolyte, have high lithium conductivity, and low permeability of the redox shuttles in the system. Results from this project will inform not only this unique recycling system but also related systems such as mediated flow batteries and electrochemical recovery of critical materials from other nonaqueous waste streams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data can be either directly acquired by devices such as laser scans or indirectly reconstructed from microscopy or magnetic resonance imaging. Such images and analyses appear for example in the study of human anatomy and motion or in applications to computer graphics and motion. The project lies in the broad area of statistical shape analysis, in which one tries to quantify geometric and/or topological variability within and across populations. The work aims to develop practical methods to characterize the shape of data objects in order to ascertain their roles in larger systems. The project will involve graduate students and produce open source software. <br/><br/>The project relies on the paradigms of elastic shape analysis, which is traditionally concerned with analyzing the variability in the geometries of the objects under consideration. At its core is the notion of a distance between two shapes, which stems from a Riemannian setting using a metric that is invariant to the action of certain shape-preserving transformations and embeds both the global nonlinearity of the space as well as its local linearity. The first goal is to develop a comprehensive theoretical and numerical framework for elastic shape analysis of curves and surfaces that allows for topological inconsistencies and partial matching constraints. This framework combines elastic shape analysis with methods from geometric measure theory and topological data analysis. The second goal is to apply the framework to a wide variety of synthetic and real data, in particular to morphological analysis of high-resolution orthopedic surface complexes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overall objective of this project is to build a generalizable and modular nanoreactor platform based on pore-engineered encapsulin protein shells. Initially, encapsulin-based protein shells, optimized for small molecule flux, will be designed and characterized. Structure-guided rational design and pore engineering will be combined to create novel protein shell prototypes. The general goal is to increase the porosity of the protein shell without compromising the benefits of a protective physical barrier around an enzymatic cargo.

An accurate assessment of its quantity and quality is a persistent global and national challenge, particularly in transboundary regions. This project seeks to improve our understanding of groundwater dynamics and achieve integrated water balance parameterization at fine spatial and temporal scales. The results will be especially useful to Ukraine, where the limitations of the ground observation network require more efficient assessment techniques based on remote sensing. To build algorithms and models for accurate and timely aquifer assessment, this project will bring together researchers from six countries: the United States, Ukraine, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The robust international collaboration at the core of this effort, bridging distinct transboundary human systems and connected natural aquifer systems, will accelerate progress that no single discipline or nation could achieve alone. Simultaneously, this project will foster the next generation of research leaders and support the co-development of a modern innovation ecosystem in Ukraine.<br/><br/>This project will pioneer a comprehensive transdisciplinary approach to fine-scale modeling of surface water and groundwater interactions in a transboundary setting. Our proposed technical solution integrates hydrogeologic models with satellite and ground-based data to enable water resource assessment for decision-making under uncertainty.

This award will exploit the recent development of experimental methods that engender rich data sets incorporating both flow and microstructure for complex polymeric materials.

For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. <br/><br/>This project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  <br/>1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?<br/>2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?<br/>3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?<br/>4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?<br/><br/>The team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.

Most of the existing SRM technologies are based on fluorescence which only indicates the present of the labeled targets, limiting their abilities to study complex biological systems where a large number of unknown objects interact with each other simultaneously. Label-free approach, like scattering image, does not rely on fluorescent markers and thus provides unique contrast capabilities for biological imaging. However, achieving sub-100 nm super-resolution (SR) scattering imaging remains a significant challenge. This project aims to develop the first dual-modality SRM that leverages the strengths of both imaging methods by performing SR fluorescent and SR scattering imaging simultaneously at high speed. This new imaging technology is termed as Dual-Modality Localized Plasmonic Structured Illumination Microscopy (DM-LPSIM). As the first technique to achieve video rate SRM for both fluorescence and label-free at 50-nm scale, DM-LPSIM has the potential to change the landscape of bio-imaging for studying many-body bio-interactions. If successfully demonstrated, this new microscopy tool will be made available to local biologists to assist new discoveries in biological and medical research. The educational plan includes graduate and undergraduate students training at the cross-section of optical engineering and biology with emphasis on minority student involvement. The California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) program and Outreach Program Advancing Learning in STEM (OPALS) will serve as major platforms of outreach to attract more K-12 students to the fields of microscopy and bioimaging. <br/><br/>The DM-LPSIM system is essentially a derivative of structured illumination microscopy technique with significantly improved resolving power, relying on engineered illumination patterns beyond the traditional diffraction limit. DM-LPSIM obtains the SR imaging by using a substrate with nanoplasmonic antenna array supporting sub-diffraction-limited localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), while also provide high sensitivity SR label-free imaging by taking advantage of the high sensitivity of LSPR with respect to refractive index contrast. Deep learning-based algorithms will be developed to assure high quality SR image reconstruction for both coherent and incoherent light with reduced artifacts. DM-LPSIM represents one of the first SRM techniques for both fluorescence and scattering image at the same time, signifying unique opportunities to investigate nanoscale dynamics in complex cellular activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the number of disabled students continues to increase in STEM, it is important both to support these disabled students in their STEM career paths and to provide professional development for physics faculty about how to support disabled students in their courses and programs. To that end, this project will develop professional development experiences for both physics faculty and disabled STEM students that focus on 1) promoting accessibility and inclusion in undergraduate physics courses and 2) facilitating mutually beneficial partnerships between disabled STEM students and physics faculty. The professional development efforts will support faculty in developing inclusive teaching practices and will support disabled students in navigating future STEM careers. The project will investigate the impact of this professional development effort, which could be a model for other institutions and STEM disciplines. Ultimately, this IUSE Engaged Student Learning Level 2 project aligns with NSF?s strategic goal to empower STEM talent to fully participate in science and engineering through the strategic objective of ensuring accessibility and inclusivity.<br/><br/>To investigate the effectiveness of this professional development model, this collaborative project between Michigan State University and University of Connecticut will address three research questions: 1) How, and to what extent, do participating faculty develop fluency and improve knowledge in disability, accessibility, and inclusivity? How, and to what extent, do faculty implement changes and inclusive practices in their own classrooms? 2) How, and to what extent, do participating students develop fluency and improve knowledge in career readiness, available career paths, and job application processes? How, and to what extent, do students feel empowered to address ableism within the STEM community and career contexts? 3) How do participating faculty and students view their partnership during and after the workshop, and how does this partnership affect them as individuals? These research questions will be answered using qualitative methods, including interviews with participants and document analysis of workshop materials, as well as quantitative surveys to assess participants? views and knowledge of disability in physics. From results from these studies, the project will advance knowledge about partnership-based professional development models in undergraduate STEM education, both improving access and inclusion in undergraduate physics settings as well as laying the foundation for future professional development efforts focused on accessibility and inclusion in undergraduate STEM education more broadly.

The production of these hybrid materials has major challenges such as multi-step, toxicity concerns, and batch-to-batch variability. These limitations prompted the development of processes that are safer, scalable, and produce many samples without batch-to-batch variability. This study proposes to use a combination of 3D printing of polymers with a greener method of plasma (4th state of matter) processing to fabricate gold and silica nanoparticle-modified 3D printed Polymer Materials. The major highlight of this study is the utility of these two scalable and efficient processes to efficiently produce nanoparticle-modified polymer materials. These nanoparticle-modified materials will be used to reliably study the material and biological responses on a large scale. The work will investigate the capability of the gold and silica nanoparticle-modified polymers for osteogenesis or bone-forming potential. This can provide new insights into the relationship between the material properties of nanoparticle-modified polymers and their biological responses that will positively impact the clinical success rate of polymer-nanoparticle hybrid materials for applications like bone tissue engineering. An important component of this project is the focus on training underrepresented minority students at Alabama State University which is a Historically Black College and University. These students will increase the diversity in the Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, which is currently at a very low level. The project also will conduct science outreach activities that can enhance the scientific curiosity and awareness of the general community in the state of Alabama.

This is due to the complexity of the multistep nature of the process, e.g., separate synthesis of the nanoparticle and then subsequent anchoring of the nanoparticles on scaffold surfaces. The toxicity concerns of the nanoparticles are another major concern limiting their application in tissue engineering. The major significance of this work is that it attempts to explore the combination of 3D printing which can design and produce new, consistent, and scalable 3D scaffold designs, and plasma processing, which in one step can stably attach/deposit gold and silica nanoparticles in a green and efficient manner. The osteogenic potential of these nanoparticle-modified 3D scaffolds will be conducted in a Highthrouput manner.  Such a hybrid approach can have a significant impact on the materiobiolgy evaluation of nanoparticle-modified 3D scaffold materials. This can improve in vitro approaches and maximize the success rate of further in vivo testing of nanoparticle-modified biomaterials, thus saving time and overall expenses related to preclinical studies.

CSU is the largest public university system in the country with 23 campuses and approximately 490,000 students with first-generation college students and students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups making up over 50% of the student body. The 11 CSU campuses included in this project represent approximately 55% of the total CSU student population. Physics majors at these HSI institutions have very limited upper division elective courses and research opportunities which seriously hurt their graduation rates and limit their career choices and development. <br/><br/>Colliders for experimental particle physics research only exist in international and national labs and experimental particle physics research typically only exists in national labs and R1 universities. Very few CSU campuses have programs in experimental particle physics. This project is centered around the CSU Fresno program on the ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) experiment of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. ATLAS is a leading project in particle physics and is poised to address some of the deepest questions in the field of particle physics, the answers to which could change our view of how the universe works. This project will provide exceptional ATLAS research opportunities to students from the 14 HSI institutions. The three online particle physics courses developed as part of this project will impact over 300 students and provide opportunities for 48 students to work on cutting-edge ATLAS research projects in the highest quality research environment during summers. The research conducted by the participating students will advance the field of particle physics and contribute to ATLAS data analyses and other ATLAS activities. The ATLAS research experience will create a pathway for students from underprivileged groups to excel in STEM fields. The online courses and summer research course will fulfill the upper division elective course graduation requirements. The education research and independent external evaluation components will allow the project to carry out a systematic study of an exemplary model to improve STEM education at HSI institutions by effectively pooling and sharing resources. This project's focus on students from URM groups and first-generation CSU students promotes diversity in STEM. Through the CSU Fresno PHYS 168S (""Physics Outreach"") course, the ATLAS students in PHYS 168S will visit two new K-12 classrooms each week to teach K-12 students about the ATLAS experiment and encourage them to pursue science. The proposed outreach efforts will reach several schools, their students and students' families in the Fresno and Central Valley areas.

In many cases, the details of the alignment and relative positions (microstructure) of the polymer molecules play a key role in their performance, and these features depend sensitively on the flows used to manufacture them. This award will exploit the recent development of experimental methods that engender rich data sets incorporating both flow and microstructure for complex polymeric materials. The availability of these data provides the opportunity to develop and apply machine learning, data science, and polymer physics toward development of predictive mathematical models that will ultimately enable design of advanced manufacturing processes involving complex materials. <br/><br/>Transformational progress in exploiting modern data-driven methods toward modeling flowing complex fluids requires (1) large experimental data sets involving time-evolution of flow and microstructure in a diverse range of flows, and (2) new modeling frameworks to exploit these data sets. This award advances these two themes toward development of a tool to rapidly develop predictive models of fluid structure and stress in material classes for which no first-principles-based models currently exist. Rich and realistic experimental data sets will be used, which come from simultaneous flow and spatially-resolved scattering measurements for complex fluids in complex flows. The new modeling frameworks will integrate machine learning, data assimilation, dimension reduction, and data-driven dynamic modeling, informed by the physics of flowing complex fluids.  These methods will be applied to a grand challenge problem in materials processing: discovery of new physical descriptions of non-dilute orientable particle dispersions, informing the construction of new first principles models to describe the coupling of flow with particle interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organoids are useful for understanding human organ development, how cells talk to each other, and how our bodies fix themselves. This project focuses on making better organoids that act more like real organs. Organoids are usually made from special cells that can become many different cell types. With guidance, these cells organize themselves into a 3D shape that look like the real organ. Many organoids are not yet as good as they could be. First, researchers have made organoids for brains, kidneys, and lungs, but not all organs are represented as organoids yet.  For example, adrenal gland organoids do not exist. Adrenal glands are critical for producing hormones that help us regulate stress, how much water to drink, and sexual development. Here, the aim is to make adrenal gland organoids. Second, most organoids are spheres, but most organs have different shapes; these shapes matter and adrenal gland organoids in the shape of real adrenal glands will be made. Third, big organoids sometimes have dead parts inside, because food and oxygen cannot reach the inside without blood vessels. Here, plant roots will be used to make straw-like tunnels into the organoids so that food can reach the inside. In a give-and-take approach, what is learned will be shared with others. In collaboration with artists, a room-size organoid sculpture will be created, and dances inspired by the science will be made. In return, the artists approach to the scientific problems will inspire the scientific paths. Additionally, middle and high school students will be taught through ceramic art infused science classes to model their own imaginary cells; and graduate students will create their own art-science liaison project. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to generate miniature engineered adrenal gland organoids in the native shape of the organ and to provide a vasculature-like structure that will allow them to mature. Goal 1: Make organoids that look like and function as adrenal glands. Since the shape or organs is important, it will be copied. The plan is to use 3D printing to make molds in the correct organ shape. Then, the cells will be added into these molds to grow the organoids. The engineered new organoids will be compared to spherical organoids to see if they work better. Goal 2: Make organoids that can grow bigger and live longer. Most organoids stop growing or die when they get too big. Here, plant roots will be stuck into the organoids to create straw-like structures that will allow food and oxygen to get to the inside of the organoids and keep the cells there alive, even if the organoids get big and old. In the end, this project will help researchers learn more about how to make better organoids. This project will culminate in an organoid symposium, where everyone can see what is learned about organoids through science, education and art.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A crucial technology for making this a reality is the development of efficient supersonic combustors for air-breathing hypersonic engines. These combustors differ from traditional ones in their extremely short residence times, typically around 1 millisecond. In such a short time, the fuel must be injected, vaporized (for liquid fuels), dispersed, and mixed to the molecular level with the incoming air before combustion can occur. Turbulence, which aids dispersion and mixing, is vital in this process. However, understanding how compressibility affects turbulence production is still incomplete, slowing down hypersonic flight development. This project aims to investigate compressibility effects on turbulence by directly measuring turbulence in the Mach 3 wind tunnel at Missouri University of Science and Technology. As turbulence plays a key role in the mixing process, understanding its production and how it is affected by compressibility would facilitate a better understanding of the mixing process in supersonic flows and the design of supersonic combustors.<br/><br/>While turbulence production in supersonic flows has been recently investigated, compressibility effects ? particularly on density fluctuations ? have been largely neglected in non-wall-bounded flows such as jets and shear, which are relevant for mixing applications. Recent research indicates that even for the relatively low supersonic Mach number of a scramjet combustor (30-40% of the flight Mach), compressibility effects on turbulence production can be comparable to incompressible turbulence production. This analysis, based on theoretical arguments and limited experimental/numerical data from the available literature, indicates that the Strong Reynolds Analogy (a correlation between velocity and density fluctuations), initially developed for boundary layers, is also valid for unbounded supersonic mixing flows. This project proposes to experimentally verify the validity of the Strong Reynolds Analogy in a supersonic mixing unbounded flow by directly measuring density and velocity fluctuations utilizing two-point Focused Laser Differential Interferometry (2-FLDI). 2-FLDI is a proven low-cost technique that allows high-frequency, simultaneous, non-intrusive measurements of density and velocity fluctuations. The flow will consist of a simple planar jet from a pylon injector in a Mach 3 free stream. This work will also support STEM outreach through the development of a summer camp, and workforce development in hypersonics by supporting both graduate and undergraduate students. Findings from this work will also be incorporated into a graduate class on turbulent flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accurate and reliable forecasts of greenhouse gas emissions are critical for the improvement of global models that predict changes to temperature and to sea level. On a local level, the data and modeling products can be used to better inform local populations of the changes happening to their environment and help predict likely changes in the future. Improvements to regional and global scale models require advancement in the current knowledge of methane and carbon dioxide flux sources to gain insight into how the net flux is expected to respond to a warming Arctic. Comparing aircraft derived fluxes to local tower measurements and land classification maps allows for the determination of which mechanisms are primarily responsible for the variation in emissions. Data, models, and analysis directly measuring the fluxes over regional scales close to the surface and measuring fluxes using inverse modeling helps to better understand the differences. Data generated from this project are important for evaluating which combination of environmental quantities and categorical quantities are best suited for predicting methane and carbon dioxide emissions to produce more accurate estimates from remotely sensed variables and will also be compared with existing carbon emissions models. The ability to define the current late summer and autumn net flux of methane and carbon dioxide from the North Slope and adjoining Arctic waters is required to establish a benchmark for quantitatively tracking the annual time series of net carbon flux from the Arctic.<br/><br/>This research provides emission measurements of CO2 and CH4 plus nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapor (H2O) from the North Slope of Alaska on a small aircraft operating at altitudes from 10 m to 10 km, with custom-built spectroscopic sensors, an air turbulence probe, and GPS systems. This project bridges the scale gap between local studies of carbon emissions in the Arctic, such as those from flux towers, and large regional scale emissions estimates from inversion modeling. The work provides resolved emissions correlated with underlying sources; regional coverage for comprehensive analysis of carbon emissions in this part of the Arctic basin; direct coupling of the observations with other observing systems ranging from small tower measurements to satellite remote sensing; and coupling of the observations to an air transport model to compare direct emission measurements to top-down estimates of regional emissions based on profile measurements in the atmosphere. Specifically, aircraft eddy covariance measurements and vertical profiles are used to effectively scale process measurements from short eddy covariance towers to the regional scale, allowing for determining how representative certain areas are of the larger North Slope with respect to flux of the major gases that contribute to changes in radiative forcing. Observations and modeling of fluxes and concentrations of molecules that differ in their isotopic composition reveal the contributions of key source processes at local, landscape, and regional scale, a feature unique to this project. This project creates an analysis framework to allow for the combination of in situ concentrations and fluxes with regional fluxes calculated using a transport model that both is adapted for Alaska and widely applicable to other circumpolar areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significant uncertainty is often involved in predicting the extinction or population decline of species, even with high-resolution information. Changes in the taxonomic classification of biological species is a key challenge that impacts both  biodiversity conservation and policy decisions. The taxonomy is described in words and these words provide an opportunity to use natural language processing and machine learning (ML) to clarify species relationships and provide novel insights into extinction risk by addressing the variability in species taxonomy. Developing an accurate and scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) for ?taxonomic intelligence? can help support the robustness of conservation decision making. This is important because the taxonomic classification can move a group of organisms in or out of consideration for legal protection. AI can help in this classification and support coordination of conservation projects.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop AI/ML techniques to provide novel insights into extinction risk, by projecting different contingent outcomes for species distributions and risks under different taxonomic perspectives. It is critical that the derived insights be understandable to humans, to safely translate these outcomes into operational recommendations. Biodiversity data, which include taxonomical and geospatial data, pose unique challenges to AI in that they are heterogeneous, structurally complex, and frequently change. This project aims to address these challenges with a novel approach combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) from the textual data of relevant scientific publications, and automated inductive and deductive reasoning, including qualitative spatial reasoning incorporating the taxonomic factor and relevant domain structures, for discovery of human-understandable knowledge for conservation biology applications. In doing so, this project also has the potential to advance AI beyond a single  application domain. The research activities to be undertaken in this award include data and knowledge curation with the help of domain experts, and the development and evaluation of the aforementioned AI techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this regime, multiple agents (e.g., processors or sensors) communicate their information locally with their neighbors to cooperatively optimize a global performance metric. This decentralized paradigm plays a key role in the network domains where communication with a centralized coordinator is either undesirable or impossible. This also allows for preserving the privacy of the agents. It is for these reasons that the design and performance analysis of decentralized optimization methods have attracted a growing attention in several application domains such as data science, wireless networks, and communication networks. This project is aimed at development of new models, mathematical tools, and computational algorithms to address emerging complex multi-agent systems. This complexity arises in emerging applications such as remote sensing, economic dispatch models with renewable energy, and efficiency estimation in transportation networks. This proposal has the potential to substantially reduce the gap between the theory and real-world practice of complex multi-agent networks. Moreover, collaborations with the industrial partner will facilitate effective knowledge transfer. This project is also aimed at increasing awareness and interest among high school students, educators, and college students through several fully integrated educational and outreach activities. These include enhancing professional development of teachers of Stillwater High School, engaging secondary students in after school activities, and promoting diversity through involvement of underrepresented undergraduate students in research. <br/><br/>The long-term research goal is to advance the computational models and algorithms for distributed constrained optimization in emerging complex multi-agent networks. In pursuit of this goal, the research objective of this CAREER proposal is to apply the theory of variational inequalities and regularization in the field of distributed optimization to design new algorithms with provable performance guarantees that can address multi-agent networks with complex constraints. This complexity arises in several application domains such as wireless sensor networks, transportation networks, and machine learning, where the optimization model is complicated due to the presence of:  (1) uncertainty and nonlinearity in constraints; (2) an inner-level large-scale optimization problem; or (3) equilibrium constraints. The state-of-the-art approaches including weighted-averaging consensus, push-sum, and alternate direction multiplier methods work often under the premise that functional constraints are easy-to-project. These schemes rely significantly on Lagrangian duality theory and do not lend themselves to asynchronous protocols and communication delays. Accordingly, this research is expected to advance the area of distributed optimization over complex networks by: (i) Development of an enhanced mathematical modeling framework by utilizing the theory of variational inequalities; (ii) Design and analysis of new classes of iteratively regularized consensus-based algorithms with explicit performance bounds to address the proposed modeling framework; and (iii) Explore novel ways to address nonsmoothness in the proposed modeling framework. The long-term educational goal is to broaden the participation of K-12 and college students (in particular women and underrepresented minorities in STEM) in the fields of Operations Research and Applied Mathematics. In pursuit of this goal, the educational objective of this CAREER proposal is to inspire and engage young minds, formal and informal educators, and undergraduate and graduate students in understanding the role of optimization in tomorrow?s practice. This includes the following activities: (i) provide four-week professional development workshops for secondary teachers; (ii) develop an after school STEM program for Stillwater High School students; (iii) involve underrepresented undergraduate students in the PI?s research in collaboration with The Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation; and (iv) develop an undergraduate and an advanced doctoral course.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reliable and robust energy storage systems play a crucial role in the national transition towards a carbon-neutral economy. Lithium-ion batteries have brought a paradigm shift in the field of energy generation and storage, particularly in electric transportation. However, the annual generation of spent lithium-ion battery waste is projected to exceed 5 million tons by 2030, with only 5% being recycled worldwide. While existing recycling processes have been implemented industrially, they face significant challenges such as high energy consumption, low metal separation efficiency, limited recyclability, and substantial waste generation. To promote a circular economy and establish a waste-to-resource supply chain, it is imperative to develop efficient and sustainable metallurgical technologies for lithium-ion battery recycling. The objective of this EAGER research project is to advance the recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries through the development of next-generation recycling technologies based on benign leaching and electrodeposition using deep eutectic solvents. This project will develop a closed-loop process that minimizes waste while maximizing metal recovery. The project will enable sustainable recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries thereby saving energy, reducing pollutants, and accelerating electrification. Furthermore, the intrinsically interdisciplinary nature of the research will foster a diverse training environment, providing opportunities for training and mentorship for both graduate and undergraduate students. Knowledge gained through this study will be incorporated into existing courses, thus extending the experimental design approach to education activities, and benefiting more than 80 undergraduate and graduate students annually.<br/><br/>This research project will elucidate the mechanisms and chemistry involved in the recovery of battery metals using deep eutectic solvents and provide an innovative approach to recycling and reusing end-of-life products. The integrated research approach entails experimental testing, operando diagnostics, and statistical analysis, to develop a sustainable battery recycling process comprising leaching and electrodeposition within deep eutectic solvents. The physicochemical mechanisms of the process along with their impact on process efficiency will be revealed through solubility measurements and coordination complex identification under various conditions, complemented by morphological characterization, quantitative elemental mapping, and microstructural analysis. These efforts will offer valuable insights into the solvating capabilities of various deep eutectic solvents, transport properties of battery metals in deep eutectic solvent electrolytes, and coordination behaviors of battery metals in diverse deep eutectic solvent environments. Enhanced selectivity and product purity will be realized by exploring different solution chemistries and fine-tuning process operating parameters. The project will also unveil reaction pathways, rate-determining steps, and apparent activation energies, and provide a robust framework for accurately predicting process responses based on operating parameters, thus facilitating effective metal recovery from waste lithium-ion batteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lithium?sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising candidates because of their higher energy density and reduced cost due to the use of sulfur. However, a key limitation of the Li-S system is polysulfide shuttling. Shuttling occurs when polysulfide molecules from the cathode dissolve into the electrolyte and shuttle across the separator to react with the anode materials. This process is irreversible and leads to a rapidly fading capacity. This project addresses the fundamental shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides in lithium sulfur batteries with emphasis on developing surface engineered host materials for immobilizing lithium polysulfides and promoting their conversion. A series of surface engineered and shape-controlled cerium oxides will be developed and characterized to understand which structural features best limit polysulfide shutting. Such knowledge is critical for designing novel host materials and long-life energy storage systems, which will have a potentially immense impact on portable electronics, electric vehicles, and devices for intermittent renewable energy storage from solar and wind resources. The investigator will continue to support the outstanding recruitment, mentoring, and retention of minority students in STEM by providing unique research opportunities for undergraduates as early as their freshman year and with continuing scholarships to promote their retention.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the effect of surface engineered polar CeO2 addition as a host material via shape control (nanorods, nanocubes, and nanoctahedra with different exposed crystal planes: (110), (100) and (111)) and chemical etching treatment on the lithium polysulfides immobilization, catalytic conversion, and electrochemical performance in lithium-sulfur batteries. These findings will provide insight into a fundamental understanding of sulfur conversion chemistry and act as a guide for the future design and screening of new host materials toward achieving high sulfur loading/utilization in lithium-sulfur batteries. The investigators hypothesize that physical confinement and surface engineered polar CeO2 with distinct termination surface structures would effectively store and entrap sulfur species to prevent the dissolution and migration of intermediate lithium polysulfides avoiding the shuttle effect and capacity degradation during the electrochemical cycling. In addition, ex situ/in situ transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy characterization techniques will be employed to achieve a deeper understanding of dynamic adsorption/desorption, liquid/solid and solid/solid interactions, and structural/compositional changes at the lithium polysulfides/CeO2 interface. New insights (quantitative dynamic atomic-level structural and chemical characterizations) into lithium polysulfides/CeO2 interfacial structures will provide powerful practical strategies to promote or suppress various kinds of interface phenomena. The obtained knowledge on battery chemistry of sulfur-oxide additive interaction promises long-life and high energy/power density lithium-sulfur batteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the root of these problems is the fundamental question of landscape terraformation:  how does life expand and sustain itself, in increasingly complex and symbiotic forms, across landscapes at multiple scales to transform bare rock into complex multi-function ecosystems?  This Growing Convergence Research team of earth scientists (hydrologists, geochemists), biologists (evolutionary genomicists, ecosystem ecologists), and social scientists (anthropologists who study cultures of science) will leverage a unique and powerful ?convergence instrument? -- University of Arizona?s Landscape Evolution Observatory, consisting of three large experimental hillslopes at Biosphere 2 -- to both reveal key mechanisms of landscape terraformation and catalyze new ways of interdisciplinary thinking to empower and diversify this next generation of scientists to achieve convergence research. <br/><br/>The central investigation of this work is of how small scale hydrological, geochemical, ecological and evolutionary processes interact to create emergent landscape-scale terraformation, across three stages of biological complexity:  from simple lithotrophic microbial communities (including microbial crusts), to non-vascular plants (mosses without roots), to vascular plants with roots and sophisticated hydraulic architectures. Experiments will test model representations of water flow through landscapes, its effects on the transformation of rock via weathering at different scales, and thence, feedbacks which modify those landscapes and their biological habitability. At the same time, the composition and function of organisms as they colonize barren landscapes and develop symbiotic associations (especially for N fixation) will be manipulated to select from biological diversity in genes, traits, and functions, in order to identify the biological feedbacks which simultaneously transform hydrological and geochemical processes.

RNA is also used by some viruses to store genetic information. These diverse and important functions motivate the development of sensors that allow for a sensitive detection and identification of RNA molecules. This project will develop RNA sensors for two specific classes of RNA molecules: i.) microRNA (miRNA), a regulatory class of RNA that has potential as biomarkers for diseases such as cancer, and ii.) viral RNA to enable a rapid detection of RNA viruses, such as the corona virus (Covid-19). The proposed sensor platform contains a DNA strand connected at its ends to two metal nanoparticles whose optical signal depend on their separation. The DNA sensor strand is designed to change its structure when it binds to a specific RNA target. This structural modification changes the separation between the nanoparticle probes and alters their signal, which is sensitively detected even for small nanoparticles via interference of the scattered signal with a reference light beam. The sensor will be designed to detect miRNA directly, but for viral RNA the coupled nanoparticle sensor will be combined with an enzymatic signal amplification step to obtain a sensitive and rapidly reconfigurable detection platform. The research will be integrated into education and outreach activities that include development of course work to support the research, organization of a summer workshop on the fundamentals of plasmonics and nanoscience for inner city high school students in the Boston area and their teachers that is designed to excite them about a career in science and technology, and development of an Instagram channel that will provide an excellent platform for educating a lay audience about plasmonic nanosensors.<br/><br/>The project will combine molecular beacon like DNA structures whose ends are functionalized with noble metal nanoparticle (NP) probes with two-color interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) detection to generate a plasmon coupling based sensor for two important classes of RNA: i.) regulatory miRNA and ii.) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Target RNA binding to the sensor induces a conformational change from a ?closed? to an ?open? conformation and alters the plasmon coupling between the NP labels bound to the DNA strand. Two-color iSCAT microscopy will be applied to enhance the sensitivity for detecting changes in the interferometric scattering signal associated with the opening of the sensor upon binding to its target. The DNA recognition element of the sensor will be designed to bind to miRNA directly, while for the viral RNA the plasmonic transducer will be combined with CRISPR-CAS13 detection and subsequent sample amplification to obtain a sensitive and reconfigurable viral RNA detection platform. Instead of directly binding to viral RNA, the molecular beacon will recognize RNA fragments generated through CAS13 trans-cleavage of a substrate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microorganisms in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are buried over glaciological time and form a stratigraphy record providing the opportunity of analysis of the order and position of layers of geological events, with potential links to Southern Hemisphere climate. However, microbial cells that land on the ice sheet are subject to the stresses of changing habitat conditions due to burial and conditions associated with long-term isolation in ice. These processes may lead to a loss of fidelity within the stratigraphic record of microbial cells. We know little about how and if microorganisms survive burial and remain alive over glacial-interglacial time periods within an ice sheet. This analysis will identify the viable and preserved community of microorganisms and core genomic adaptation that permit cell viability, which will advance knowledge in the areas of microbiology and glaciology while increasing fidelity of ice core measurements relevant to past climate and potential future global climate impacts. This exploratory endeavor has the potential to be a transformative step toward understanding the ecology of one of the most understudied environments on Earth. The project will partner with the Museum of Science, Boston, to increase public scientific literacy via education and outreach. Additionally, this project will support two early-career scientists and two undergraduates in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of microbiology and climate science. <br/><br/>Results from this project will provide the first DNA data based on single-cell whole genomic sequencing from the Antarctic Ice Sheet and inform whether post-depositional processes impact the interpretations of paleoenvironmental conditions from microbes. The goals to determine the taxonomic identity of viable and preserved microbial cells, and decode the genetic repertoire that confers survival of burial and long-term viability within glacial ice, will be achieved by utilizing subsamples from a ~60,000 year old record of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide (WD) Ice Core. WD samples will be melted using the Desert Research Institute?s ice core melting system that is optimized for glaciobiological sampling. Microbial cells from the meltwater will be sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and individually sorted cells will have their genomes sequenced. The fluorescence-based methods will discern the viable (metabolically active) cells from those cells that are non-viable but preserved in the ice (DNA-containing). The genomic analysis will identify the taxonomy of each cell, presence of known genes that confer survival in permanently frozen environments, and comparatively analyze genomes to determine the core set of genes required by viable cells to persist in an ice sheet. The outcomes of this work will expand the potential for biological measurements and contamination control from archived ice cores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cafes were popular as conversations were informal in casual settings and engendered deep discussions. In 2007, Science Education Solutions received a grant from NSF and began an experiment to see if the adult science caf model could be adapted to appeal to high school teens. The program, Caf Scientifique New Mexico, became very popular with teens in towns across northern New Mexico. The blend of conversing with scientists about interesting science topics in an out-of-school social setting and digging deeper with hands on activities proved successful. The teen model was refined through trial and error and formal evaluation over several years. Today it continues to provide teens with a new perspective on the nature of science and a picture of scientists as real people leading interesting lives. The Teen Science Caf Network (TSCN) was formed in 2012 with NSF funding to allow other individuals and organizations to start their own versions of the Teen Science Caf, adapted to their local institutions and demographics. Five founding member organizations around the United States formed the initial Network and each began creating their own Teen Science Caf programs. Today the TSCN is a dynamic, growing community of practice spread across the country with the mission of connecting high school teenagers with STEM and STEM experts via the science caf model. The network currently has approximately 133 member organizations in 46 states and Canada. This project will move the network to a much larger scale by creating organization and professional support structures to create a strategically growing social movement with distributed leadership, organizational infrastructure, and robust professional development for long-term stability with a goal to increase the number of member organizations to 500 over five years. Building on the literature on professional development for informal science educators and the literature on network capacity building, network sustainability, and scale, the project will also conduct research that will inform the field about successful model diffusion. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understanding of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>This Innovations in Development project has five objectives. The first is to re-structure the Teen Science Caf Network (TSCN) to a more distributed leadership model that will move the network to long-term sustainability. The PI team will identify five experienced individuals already leading strong caf programs to become Guides for new sites. These Guides will provide training, support, and mentorship to new network members. Each Guide will have responsibility over a given year for mentoring two cohorts of nine sites, allowing the network to increase in size over the next five years. The second objective is to implement an interactive program of professional development for new network members. The training will involve approximately 15 hours of adult leader training focused on building skills around teen engagement and caf management. The third objective will be to strategically engage all members in the network community of practice through opportunities to participate in and lead ongoing learning with their peers. Through webinars, Birds of a Feather groups and annual workshops and a Science Events Summit, caf leaders will actively hone professional skills and broaden their personal network. Objective four is to broaden the involvement of organizations and communities not currently in the network through strategic recruitment of STEM professional societies, military youth programs, library networks, and youth-serving organizations, among other organizations. Finally, objective five is to implement a research agenda to contribute to the informal learning knowledge base. The research will focus on how the project?s approach to network growth and distributed leadership leads to effective scaling and sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These extremes are likely to occur more frequently over the coming decades and will likely have more severe effects on natural and human landscapes than when extreme events occur alone. Many parts of southern Africa suffered the effects of compound extremes in 2015 and 2016 when drought and heavy wildlife use caused substantial declines in vegetative cover and mass wildlife mortality in national parks. Many areas are yet to fully recover. Ecosystem recovery after compound extremes is critical for maintaining important services that landscapes provide, such as wildlife habitat, food production, and carbon storage. The mechanisms behind recovery after extreme events are not well understood, although there is mounting evidence that the diversity of organisms (i.e., biodiversity) within ecosystems may be key. This award will experimentally impose compound extremes in a South African savanna and incorporate measured outcomes into computer models to understand how diversity of plant life controls ecosystem recovery after compound extremes. The information and tools created by this project will be important for land managers and policy makers to maximize the recovery potential of public and private lands through the promotion of biodiversity. Additionally, this project will provide important training and education opportunities for a diverse assemblage of people (local South African stakeholders, high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars), and will prioritize advancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the sciences.<br/><br/>Currently, the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem recovery (i.e., resilience) is recognized at the community level, but the mechanisms underlying species diversity that can extend these concepts to other spatial and hierarchical scales are not well understood. Organismal traits provide a useful framework for understanding these mechanisms because the coordination of physiological, morphological, and anatomical characteristics determine the response of individuals to their environment; this facilitates scaling from organisms to populations, communities, and ecosystems using first principles. This study will first extend biodiversity-resilience ideas beyond simple species diversity by using methods to examine diversity of plant traits (e.g., functional dispersion). Second, it will scale biodiversity-resilience relationships from individual organisms, through populations and communities, to entire ecosystems. To these ends, this project will experimentally impose extreme drought, extreme grazing, and extreme fire, singly and in combination, in a South African savanna and determine (1) diversity of functional traits before, during, and after treatments to link with (2) responses of individuals, populations, communities, and the ecosystem during and after treatments. Empirical data will then be used to parameterize and benchmark a mechanistic demographic vegetation model to expand the inference of these effects to longer time frames and a wider range of biodiversity scenarios. The three overarching questions this project will address are: (1) How does diversity at different hierarchical scales control resilience of biological function after perturbations? (2) How do perturbations affect biodiversity at multiple hierarchical scales? (3) How does diversity and resilience change with frequency and compound perturbations?<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Emerging Frontiers in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

And while that technology has proven to be quite robust and useful, one of its major drawbacks is the amount of energy they store. An alternate battery technology that has seen extensive research in the last decade is lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. All else being equal and assuming some hurdles can be overcome, the Li-S battery would have 2-3 times the energy storage capacity of current lithium-ion batteries. It follows that if an electric car?s current range is 200 miles, its range if equipped with a Li-S battery would be 400-600 miles. Two important hurdles that need to be overcome for Li-S batteries are: the nature of the electrolyte between the electrodes and their rapid fade. In this project, the researchers, together with industry partners, will address both problems. Currently, most of the research in Li-S batteries make use of electrolytes (ether) that are highly volatile and pose safety risks when operated above room temperature. Moreover, additives to this electrolyte comes with serious transport regulations due to degassing safety concerns. In this project, the researchers will make use of the same electrolyte that is currently being used for Li-ion batteries, which has an excellent safety record and can be used at temperatures higher than room temperature. The second problem of the rapid fade in capacity with cycling is another challenge. To solve that problem the researchers will study new 2-dimensional materials (think sheets of paper at the atomic level) to immobilize the S, both physically and chemically, to prevent it from shuttling between the battery electrodes that leads to their fade. In terms of broader impact, the researchers, by partnering with a major battery company and an end-use heavy-duty automotive company, will ensure industrial relevance of the research. If successful, this technology could lead to longer lasting batteries, creating new jobs and ensuring that the United States becomes a major player in the energy storage field. Educational broader impact will be achieved by providing training and research opportunities for graduate students pursuing PhDs and undergraduates? involvement in the research. <br/><br/>This fundamental GOALI project will address two key barriers for Li-S battery performance, an electrolyte that can operate at higher temperatures and mitigation of capacity loss due to polysulfide shuttling loss. The project will study a new class of materials to host sulfur, S-terminated MXenes. MXenes are two-dimensional (2D) carbides and/or nitrides discovered at Drexel in 2011 that exhibit metallic conductivity. Preliminary results have shown that MXenes are one of the few material platforms that allow both physical and chemical confinement/immobilization of S, thus reducing/minimizing the polysulfide shuttle effect. The MXenes? metallic conductivity and ?dual-immobilization? strategy will allow stable operation in carbonate electrolytes, while still enabling >70 wt.% S, with 7 mg/cm2 loadings and 83% effective S utilization (1400 mAh/g) ? all necessary pre-requisites to approach the application targeted 500 Wh/kg. The cathode research on synthesis, fabrication, and study of redox activity of S-MXene cathodes will be integrated with carbonate electrolyte engineering to further suppress possible adverse polysulfide-carbonate reactions by reducing the electrophilicity. Post-mortem and in-operando spectroscopic and microscopic studies will be conducted to elucidate the quasi-solid-state redox pathways in S-terminated MXene hosts, detect the presence of polysulfides, or other undesired side products, from S-carbonate interactions. Cell-level Newman-type modeling, identifying limiting phenomena will further guide material design. The ultimate objective of this GOALI project - in collaboration with industry partners - is to develop Li-S batteries with practical S-loadings and S-utilizations that stably operate in high boiling point commercial carbonate electrolytes for application in heavy-duty battery electric vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While evidence of ice melt is worldwide, such as decreasing sea-ice extent, loss of ice shelves in polar regions and a reduction in annual lake-ice coverage, ice melt rates are poorly quantified, resulting from limited field data and relatively coarse measurements of ice thickness. Ice thickness measurements, made by propagating acoustic signals through the ice, decrease in resolution as a function of the attenuation properties and overall ice thickness. Novel acoustic metamaterials will be used in this Ideas Lab: Engineering Technologies to Advance Underwater Sciences(ETAUS) project to develop a transformative technology tool that can provide long-range, high-resolution measurements of ice thickness and provide a new mechanism to image the internal structure of the ice. These high-resolution observations will be used to refine global estimates of ice melt by looking at changes through time. Initial testing and development will be conducted in a laboratory setting before validation on natural lake ice that is variable in its acoustic signal attenuation properties. In every phase, the development and experimental demonstration will be guided by numerical modeling. This developed instrument will be transformative in terms of scientific understanding of all forms of ice within the cryosphere from the Arctic to the Antarctic. While polar regions are at the forefront of climate change, they are also some of the least accessible areas of the planet and make it difficult for the public to engage. To this end, new educational materials will be developed with the help of the education and outreach team at the Tahoe Environmental Research Center, which will be used to help broaden public participation in lake science and engineering.<br/><br/>To effectively monitor and predict climate-related changes, a key scientific need in all disciplines of the under-ice scientific community is to accurately measure ice accretion and melt rates at the ice/water interface, then use that information to generate better models of under-ice water circulation and mixing. However, existing technologies are limited by their imaging capabilities, measurement resolutions, and bulky sizes, which hinder their applications for scientific discovery. To address these limitations, this project will develop a new metamaterial-enhanced acoustic phased array (MEAPA) system and to explore the application of this system for high-resolution estimations of ice melt. Graded index acoustic metamaterials will be investigated to provide improved focusing, beam steering, and collimation properties to achieve high-resolution imaging (subwavelength resolution) in thinner ice and to further enhance the detection range of the MEAPA system in thicker ice. The developed MEAPA system will be characterized and validated in laboratory and field settings. Then, it will be used to better parameterize bottom roughness, and the data will be coupled to boundary layer dynamics observations of lake ice in three-dimensional hydrodynamic models. Coupling the engineering development of this instrument with the scientific need of the polar ice community will inform subgrid processes of General Circulation Models (GCM) for polar regions. Ultimately, this system will enable us to better predict ice growth and melt with accurate models and to better quantify mass gain and loss from lake ice to ice shelves in Antarctica.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The northernmost of these wind gaps is the ?Tehuantepec Gap? (along the southwest coast of Mexico). These locally known winds (here simply Tehuantepec Gap Winds) drive intense upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich water in the Gulf primarily in the winter when high atmospheric pressures over North America establish a pressure gradient across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Despite the potential importance of the Tehuantepec Gap Winds as an Atlantic-Pacific teleconnection, there has been no attempt to predict the response of these winds to changes in regional climate dynamics in the context of rapid and global climate change. The researchers suggest to combine past climate records of upwelling (from sedimentary radiocarbon over the last 30.000 years) and model simulations to characterize atmospheric dynamical processes over the North Atlantic, and to examine both the sensitivity of these winds to ?upstream? factors as well as the ?downstream? implications of this inter-basin coupling. A novel Atlantic-Pacific Ocean-atmosphere feedback mechanism is suggesting in the methodological framework and hypothesis testing of this project in which the Tehuantepec Gap Winds and atmospheric Rossby waves play a central role. This collaborative project will support two early career scientists, and the education and scientific training of undergraduate students at UC Irvine (both a Hispanic Serving Institution and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution). The researchers will continue engagement in their institution? broadening participation efforts, including ATOC REU in Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Cryospheric Sciences (NSF 2150262), a program that primarily recruits from Hispanic Serving Institutions to introduce students to data science and geoscience research. Additionally, a lesson plan focused on long-term variations in Earth?s climate will be developed as part of this project and piloted through Environmental Climate Change and Literacy Projects in California?s outreach programs and posted in an openly available national online repository for climate pedagogy (called ?Subject to Climate?).<br/><br/>The Gulf of Tehuantepec is an ideal location to characterize ?upstream? atmospheric processes linking the Pacific and Atlantic sectors because a prominent gap in the Sierra Madre mountains forces low-level winds to flow through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec toward the Pacific, driving local upwelling of deeper, lower radiocarbon waters to the surface. A preliminary model results and sediment core measurements leverage this wind-to-radiocarbon relationship to provide a precious constraint on Northern Hemisphere atmospheric dynamics over the past 23,000-years. Previous studies of contemporary climate variability and preliminary examinations of models and observational products indicate that higher atmospheric pressure over North America is associated with high near-surface pressure in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to stronger Tehuantepec winds. The project suggested here?including new sediment proxy measurements, model (Paleoclimate GCM) and data product examinations, and forward modeling?aims to discover the driving mechanisms behind the variability in Tehuantepec gap wind strength over paleoclimate timescales, which will provide a crucial new constraint on glacial-interglacial atmospheric dynamics in addition to controls on tropical Pacific Sea Surface Temperature and inter-basin moisture fluxes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Software artifacts used in DevOps yield tremendous benefits for IT organizations. However, without the secure development of these artifacts, deployed software can contain security vulnerabilities which malicious users can exploit to cause serious consequences for organizations. Therefore, students who are poised to become next-generation professionals need to be educated on (i) the consequences of security weaknesses that are commonplace in DevOps artifacts and (ii) how security weaknesses can be mitigated through secure development. This project aims to create an engaging and motivating learning environment that encourages all computer science students to learn cybersecurity integration into artifacts used for DevOps.

In the first phase, the project will investigate a low-cost inkjet-printable nonlinear-element and develop a machine-learning platform on a flexible substrate for low-level sensor data processing or in-situ computation. In the second phase, the project will integrate an efficient analog pulse-based data encoding and decoding scheme to wirelessly relay the processed sensor data from the first phase to a data center without requiring extended network bandwidth. The proposed WEPPE project is expected to produce a unique machine learning framework that hinges on the fundamentals of reservoir computing, novel inkjet-printed sensors and nonlinear elements, and wireless data telemetry scheme with secure communication. Customized hardware and low-level computing will enable in situ edge computing while maintaining quality data abstraction for real-time network-level or big data processing for rapid decision-making. The education goal is to broaden the participation of female, minority, and African-American students and train and educate them for the next era of engineering challenges.<br/><br/>This proposed project will investigate how edge computing via hardware-based machine learning and data encryption/decryption schemes may effectively resolve the IoT problems of limited bandwidth, secure data transmission, high-density data throughput, and power-efficient in-situ computation. The project has targeted mainly four research goals - (i) Research on Reservoir Computing Architectures for Sensor Network Analysis, (ii) Research on Inkjet-Printed Devices for Sensing and Physical Computing, (iii) Investigate Energy-Efficient Orthogonal Pulses and Multi-bit Data Mapping, and (iv) Research on Orthogonal Analog Pulse Based Data Compression and Decompression. A reservoir computing architecture-based machine learning platform, especially the Echo State Network (ESN), will be investigated for its simplicity, less training time with relatively reduced training data volume, and ease of deployment. As an integral part of this effort, the project will also investigate an inkjet-printed low-cost nonlinear element, which will be a core building block for developing a machine-learning platform on a flexible substrate. The reservoir will generate a state vector, which is a hyper-dimensionalized encrypted representation of the raw data, and as a result, will provide data compression and security. Fault detection and sensor fusion will occur by training the reservoir and merging the state vectors. The state vectors from the reservoirs will then be further encrypted and spectrally compressed in the ""Wearable Hub"" by a k-bit encoding scheme using analog orthogonal pulses (AOP). At the ""Local Server,"" the encoded AOPs from all the wearable hubs will be compressed by an n-pulse compression technique and transmitted to the ""Data Center."" The secured receiver at the ""Data Center"" will decode the state vectors using secured read-out neurons, providing predictions to be sent back to the end users for monitoring or large-scale processing by deep learning and other machine learning methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Floodplains provide many important benefits to people, yet they are also susceptible to changes such as flooding, pollution, and other disturbances. Understanding the effects of long-term changes in river ecosystems affected by metal pollution is extremely important. This project studies changes over ten years in the Upper Clark Fork River in Montana following a large project that restored vegetation and removed contaminated soil after damage from extensive mining in the river?s headwaters. Changes in land use and wastewater treatment are also altering nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations along the river. Since 2013, nearly 17 km of river has been restored and three core data sets have been collected, which were initiated decades before the restoration. The long-term measurements and the spatial scale of the study provides an opportunity to observe the ecological processes involved in restoration practices. Several undergraduate and graduate students are educated as part of this project, data are made available to the public, and results are shared with many stakeholders in this river system through the Clark Fork Science Forum.<br/><br/><br/>The study system of the Upper Clark Fork River in Montana, has several unique qualities that enable this project to make significant scientific advances. First, the system has received high inputs of metals that have since ceased. This enables investigation of the ecosystem dynamics over time in response to this cessation. Second, the investigators have closely observed ecological and biogeochemical responses over decadal timescales, which is the appropriate timeframe to study the types of slow processes involved in river ecosystem recovery. The project generates core data sets including: 1) influences on organic matter and sediment metals, 2) changes in upstream-downstream gradients in sediment metals, 3) metabolic responses to floodplain reconnection in restored reaches during the spring flood pulse vs. summer baseflow, 4) changes in metal bioavailability caused by interaction with dissolved organic matter, and 5) measurements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon in restored and unrestored parts of the river. Ultimately, this project investigates river ecosystem responses over large spatial (>200 km) and temporal (> decadal) scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the combination of complex underlying deep-learning models and massive training datasets makes it difficult to interpret why these models, and the developer tools powered by them, behave the way they do. Given the increasingly important role that these tools are beginning to play in software engineering (SE), it is imperative that techniques be developed that allow stakeholders to better understand and work with these tools such that critical software infrastructure can be maintained. This project will develop a framework and methodology that enables both researchers who build AI-powered developer tools, and software engineers who use these tools, to interpret why the underlying models make the predictions they do. The objective is to allow researchers to obtain detailed insights into why a model may not be performing as expected, allowing for targeted improvement and informed creation of new models. The methodology will be integrated into AI-powered software development tools, allowing software engineers to make informed decisions about when a tool?s suggestion may be helpful or harmful, thus building trust in their use. The interpretability framework will also enable new forms of interaction with these tools, providing a mechanism for natural language feedback that improves over time. This project will produce and disseminate educational materials on best practices related to building and using AI-powered programming tools. These materials are intended to be integrated into existing computer-literacy courses at all levels of education. In addition, the project will focus on recruiting and retaining computer science students from traditionally underrepresented categories.<br/><br/>This project has three specific goals. First, it will design an automated approach for generating global explanations of the behavior of ?context-free? neural language models for source code. This component of the project will map predictions from large language models to human-interpretable programming language concepts using causal inference theory, wherein explanations of behavior will be generated via causal interventions. Second, it will develop automated techniques for local explanations of contextualized language models of code by developing a set of interpretability techniques that generate behavioral, feature-based, and textual explanations defined for given SE tasks (e.g., program repair).

The properties of these materials are controlled by their architecture. As a result, their manufacture must be tightly controlled. A uniform template would be extremely useful in such processes. Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) is a plant virus with highly uniform structure. Using templates derived from BSMV is proposed as an economical alternative to current processes. Virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from BSMV will be designed to act as templates for the production of metallic nanomaterials.  Graduate and undergraduate students in will be trained to design and produce these templates. High school students from underrepresented groups and the general public will be engaged through innovative workshops that teach them about the power of biological engineering and nanomaterials. <br/><br/>BSMV is an attractive biotemplate for synthesis of metallic nanomaterials.  It can be more densely coated with metal than other biotemplates. It interacts electrostatically with metal precursor ion solutions to deposit a wider range of metals. It requires fewer processing steps to coat fully. The role of key BSMV amino acid residues in mediating metal mineralization on the VLP surface will be investigated. Protein and RNA engineering strategies to control biotemplate properties and facilitate biotemplate robustness will be pursued. Surface residues will be altered to facilitate metal-template interactions. Thermal processing to create biotemplated-materials with high electrical conductivities will be optimized. If successful, the techniques developed will create an economical bacterial expression and purification pipeline for designer BSMV biotemplates. The range of metals that ca be deposited on them will be broadened. Key insights into organic-inorganic interactions involved in metal deposition on biotemplates will be uncovered.

Utilizing pure hydrogen as an energy carrier is limited by expensive storage and transportation technologies in addition to having a low volumetric energy in comparison to hydrocarbons. Ammonia on the other hand is attractive as a carbon-free high-density hydrogen energy source. However, ammonia as a direct fuel has several shortcomings including low burning velocity, narrow flammability limits, and high nitrogen oxides emissions. It has been shown that nonthermal plasmas have the potential to control ignition/combustion characteristics of fuels. Most research to date has been incremental with plasma sources borrowed from other applications which are not suitable for combustion and realistic engineering constraints make them impractical.  The aim of this project is to study the combustion characteristics of ammonia with a novel plasma source. Considering that nearly 80% of the current worldwide energy consumption comes from burning fossil fuels, this will have a significant impact on the environment and reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels.  The research will contribute to the professional development and training of graduate and undergraduate students in the critical area of plasma-assisted combustion science.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to investigate a plasma source created by a rotating electric field to control ignition and combustion kinetics of ammonia. The plasma source conforms to the combustor geometry and efficiently produces the precursors needed to control the combustion characteristics of ammonia. The proposed method is the only known method of controlling the spatial distribution of electric field in real time resulting in volumetric electrical energy coupling and production by electron impact of radicals.  The project will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of plasma-assisted combustion and the effect of controlled release of electrical energy on the flame velocity and LBO range. This will lead to the development of predictive tools for design of plasma-assisted ignition/combustion systems. Unlike other techniques under investigation, this has a better chance of being implemented in actual devices due to its conformity to the combustion geometry and simplicity. This investigation will also inform the development of advanced engines concepts including hypersonic transportation. The work proposed will advance the knowledge of plasma assisted combustion to stabilize ignition and combustion at high altitudes and at low dynamic pressures and temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whereas most such interfaces require embedded rigid electronic components, in contrast the inherent structural and other properties of interactive morphing materials drive their sensing and actuation capabilities, from overall shape change to the dynamic tuning of characteristics such as stiffness, opacity, and phase.  Because their properties are intrinsic, many of these materials can be fabricated as thin sheets or films in support of applications such as medical and wearable devices that require conformability and compliance.  Imagine a morphing cast, for example, that could self-assemble by wrapping around the arm.  The initial pattern of holes on the sheet to ensure conformability during the self-wrapping would subsequently seal via self-growth and self-stiffening of the cast. During the healing process, as the arm swells and shrinks, the cast would sense those changes and self-tighten or self-loosen as required; it might also self-degrade gradually to become lighter and more flexible as healing progresses. This project will lay the foundation for a future where physical materials become interfaces that sense and respond dynamically in support of a fundamental transformation in computational interaction modalities.  Since morphing materials can be applied to many aspects of human endeavor, research outcomes will provide broad benefits to society in a wide range of areas including accessibility, learning, future workforce development and sustainable manufacturing. <br/><br/>The research team will take a multifaceted approach and tightly couple the research with courses and independent studies in order to generate a range of prototypes using interactive morphing materials, a framework of design principles, a library of morphing mechanisms, a design tool that facilitates the creation of interfaces leveraging morphing materials, and a formal design study to validate the effectiveness of a morphing material interface.  The project will start by clustering examples of existing and potential interactive morphing material scenarios in participatory design sessions with domain experts, design students, and design professionals to learn what they can imagine creating and figure out how their ideas can be mapped to critical design parameters, including behavior (both temporal and geometrical), input and output modalities (e.g., light-responsive self-stiffening), and functionality. Prototypes based on these ideas will be implemented, and by conducting user studies (including semi-structured interviews and pre- and post-questionnaires), a general evaluation plan and metrics for validating performance both qualitatively and quantitatively will be formulated.  This will be followed by development of toolkits incorporating a library of morphing mechanisms presented as components for interface design.  These mechanisms will be of two basic types: those that convert physical, analog stimulus (such as wetness or temperature) into morphing output, and those that can be activated with a digital signal.  In addition to mechanism development, computational tools based on geometrical principles that can be generalized across different physical morphing principles will be created.  A fast and accurate simulator enabled by the integration of machine learning and finite element analysis will be leveraged to derive the geometrical principles of the underlying computational model, and the design methods and enabling tools will be applied to conduct in-depth investigations of three application areas: advanced manufacturing, morphing wearables, and the future of creative work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intelligent machines will need to be able to understand how humans use their hands if they are to understand human actions and to work in the world humans have built with their hands. Unfortunately, videos that show people using their hands are surprisingly difficult to understand for current artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Hands may be temporarily hidden as people interact with objects, and even if they are visible, hands can interact with a myriad of different objects ranging from refrigerator handles to coffee mugs to garage door openers. This project develops systems that can enable learning about how humans use their hands from large scale Internet video data. As hands are central to many other areas of study, this project has the potential to empower research in many other disciplines. For instance, robotics researchers may use the systems to teach robots how to interact with objects by observation. Similarly, kinesiologists and mechanical engineers who study how the human hand is used could use the systems to better quantify hand motions and thus improve the lives of people. <br/><br/>This project aims to achieve its goal via three technical directions that together advance the science of understanding human activities and affordances (human/object interaction). The first direction of the project will build systems for automatically parsing hand interaction data from large-scale video. The goal of this direction is to understand what the hand is doing in terms of interaction with the world in physical terms as opposed to via naming the interaction with nouns and verbs. To help understand the context of an interaction, the second direction aims to build learning-based systems that can understand human poses from partial observations that occur naturally in video data. Finally, the third direction puts these systems together by building a graph of interaction where hand interaction examples are nodes, and edges are induced by observations of human pose. This web of interactions will enable systems to learn about how humans can manipulate objects from large-scale data across viewpoints and examples and enable new applications of computer vision.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, consider several small ground delivery robots which must navigate to specific goal positions while avoiding multiple pedestrians. Currently, decision-making algorithms follow a ""predict then plan"" approach, in which robots predict the future motion of agents in a scene and subsequently plan avoidance maneuvers. In reality, however, each agent's current decision affects the future observations and decision problems faced by others. This coupling of optimal planning through time is naturally expressed in the formalism of dynamic game theory; unfortunately, however, practical and efficient solution methods for general dynamic games have long been elusive.

The first goal is algorithmic, and aims to construct new algorithms to find approximate equilibrium solutions in several common classes of dynamic games which model distinct modes of human-robot interaction. As these algorithms solve robotic navigation problems, they must also be amenable to embedded, onboard implementation. The second goal of this project addresses the ""inverse"" problem: optimal planning in a crowd depends upon foreknowledge of humans' objectives. Whereas existing techniques infer agents' objectives in isolation, this project aims to derive novel methods for the strategically-coupled setting. The third and final goal is to accelerate interaction-aware planning in multi-robot, crowd scenarios via computational parallelization and decentralization. The algorithms will be extensively evaluated with human subjects in the setting of crowd navigation, using quadcopters and ground mobile robots.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish this Nature has evolved to incorporate catalyst sites within enzyme pockets or by physical separation using membranes. The successful construction of artificial analogues of such frameworks would reduce catalyst deactivation and eliminate undesirable side reactions. These are important goals in catalysis with many potential practical applications. With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Moteki of the University of Missouri Kansas City is developing synthetic materials possessing multiple types of incompatible catalyst sites where the sites are spatially isolated. Together with Dr. Palencia of the University of Nebraska Kearney, the catalytic efficiency and reaction scope of these catalysts are being tested. Drs. Moteki and Palencia are actively recruiting students from local high schools and community colleges, targeting underrepresented minority students, and providing them with early research experience. The research experience will increasing retention, and enhancement of underserved populations in STEM field. Summer workshops for community and small college faculty are also being conducted. Such efforts are crucial in forming new generations of young research scientists.<br/><br/>Tandem-catalyzed reactions have been widely recognized as one of the most efficient atom economical and environmentally friendly processes, due to minimization of waste generation. In particular, orthogonal tandem catalysis, which features two or more distinct catalysts with differing mechanisms, offers potential for higher process efficiency. Over the past few decades only a handful of successful examples have been reported primarily due to the difficulty in creating compartmented macro-structures that spatially separate incompatible catalysts. This proposal aims at building a multi-component catalytic dendrimer complex via chiral self-discrimination, which enables the in situ quantitative assembly of various multi-domain dendrimers through metal-chiral ligand interactions. This allows tuning of the microenvironment far easier than conventional covalently assembled systems, making it a more attractive system for reaction screening targeting various multi-step tandem chemical transformations. Our research team aims to understand the underlying catalyst structure-function relationship of the dual catalytic dendrimer by varying polarity as well as architectural design of each catalytic domains. In addition, the efficiency and versatility of dual catalytic dendrimers will be investigated, by using three different types of tandem reactions as models; i) substrate-selective tandem catalysis, ii) tandem reaction involving a catalytically reversible step, and iii) tandem reaction involving competitive catalytic pathways. The operational simplicity in reaction screening and the dendron preparation synthetic steps is ideal for training the next generation of synthetic chemists.

One strategy to help wound healing is to implant a hydrogel containing isolated hMSCs directly into the wound site.  The hydrogel provides structural integrity to the surrounding tissue.  However, during wound healing, hMSCs remodel and degrade the hydrogel over time.  These processes must be better understood to design hydrogels with the optimal properties for wound healing. This CAREER project will apply a combination of new and existing methods to characterize the region around cells during cell remodeling and degradation of the synthetic hydrogel material. The goal of the combined research and education effort is to: (1) use a novel interdisciplinary approach to provide new techniques to answer a critical problem in biomaterials and cell biology, (2) recruit and train a diverse work force and (3) educate a broad audience in biomaterials, materials characterization, and wound healing. The research will have a major impact on biomaterials design. These new materials have the potential to increase the rate of wound healing and prevent development of chronic wounds. In addition, the principle investigator will recruit, train and educate a broad audience. This will be done by: (i) outreach to the public at the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown, PA, (ii) mentoring of middle and high school students and (iii) mentoring and training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this work is to characterize the spatial and temporal rheological evolution of a synthetic hydrogel during cell-mediated degradation to determine viability as an implantable wound healing scaffold. The physical microenvironment is hypothesized to control hMSC degradation strategies during cell migration to efficiently deliver hMSCs to the wound and control material degradation. To test this, the research includes a) characterizing hMSC degradation strategies in homogenous hydrogels that mimic the stiffness of native tissues, b) determining the change in response to an interface in stiffness, and c) determining how gradients in scaffold stiffness change hMSC-mediated degradation and direct motility to increase cell delivery and material integrity. hMSCs will be encapsulated in 3D in a well-established photopolymerizable poly(ethylene glycol)-peptide hydrogel. The peptide cross-linker in this material is degraded by cell-secreted enzymes. Dynamic scaffold properties will be measured with bulk rheology and microrheology. Multiple particle tracking microrheology (MPT) will measure the spatio-temporal degradation profile created in the scaffold by encapsulated hMSCs. These measurements will determine the unique degradation strategies hMSCs use in response to changes in their microenvironment. Bulk rheology will quantify the change in material integrity as hMSCs permanently degrade the synthetic scaffold. Using this knowledge, the viability of these materials as implantable wound healing scaffolds and the microenvironments that most efficiently deliver hMSCs to an injury while providing structure to the surrounding tissue will be determined. The research outcomes will be: i) identification of the microenvironment cells engineer during motility in response to homogeneous and heterogeneous environments in the scaffold and ii) determination of microenvironments that increase cell delivery and material integrity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results of the project are expected to broaden the understanding of factors that increase STEM persistence among women and minoritized students.<br/><br/>The project will examine three overarching research questions: (1) What individual and developmental factors determine the optimal structure and content of developmental networks needed for supporting women and students of color to develop a stable engineering identity needed to persist in engineering over time? (2) How does the structure  of one?s developmental network in terms of strength of relationships with developers similar and dissimilar to women and minoritized students in terms of race/gender and density in regard to the extent to which those developers know each other influence their likelihood of overcoming imposter feelings and develop engineering identity to persist in engineering over time? (3)How does the content of one?s developmental network in terms of culturally relevant mentoring support received from developers from multiple social spheres influence their likelihood of overcoming imposter feelings and develop engineering identity to persist in engineering over time? Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected from minoritized engineering students who will participate in surveys, workshops, and exercises and analyzed using correlational analysis, means, standard deviations, reliability analysis of scale, demographic instruments, latent growth curve modeling, and structural equation modeling. The study will develop theory about developmental networks that can guide interventions designed to increase STEM persistence of women and minorities in engineering. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Mid-Career Advancement program that offers opportunities for scientists and engineers to substantively enhance and advance their research program through synergistic and mutually beneficial partnerships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current STEM activities that appeal to girls are limited. Women remain underrepresented in STEM fields, such as computer science, engineering, and the physical sciences. By fostering interests of young girls in STEM areas, this project seeks to teach and engage, and so promote their aspiration towards STEM-related careers and becoming leaders. This project brings hands-on, interest-driven learning to girls through activities involving cutting edge 4D printed robotic material technologies. 4D printing is a research area involving digital fabrication of dynamic forms, such as printing processes that produce flat objects capable of self-folding into 3D shapes when triggered by heat or other physical stimuli. Robotic materials, in this context, refer to substances, which have dynamic behaviors, and can sense, respond and act. This project will develop and study a new computational design environment centered on 4D printing of robotic materials to foster curiosity and confidence among girls through interdisciplinary design areas, including shape-changing food, dynamic fashion, and self-folding decor. Examples of materials to be modeled include pasta cooking and a jacket folding. The project will develop the new robotic materials design tool through educational and fun work with young women, in community centers, in socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods.<br/><br/>This research uses technology innovation to work for inclusiveness and equity in STEM education through hands-on, interdisciplinary making, with implications for educational research, computational design, and the development of robotic materials. It will work to advance inclusive STEM education for girls through contextualized development of a 4D robotic materials design environment and associated curriculum. Iterative design will be performed through studies conducted via workshops in informal learning environments. The project will engage middle and high school girls in a combination of creative play and structured tasks, with 4D robotic morphing materials, to investigate three research questions. (1) How to support their learning STEM concepts and skills? (2) How to challenge their preconceived attitudes about their own abilities in STEM, narrow the pre-existing knowledge gap between genders, and decrease stereotype threats? (3) How to contribute to girls gaining new confidence and STEM career aspirations? The investigation will combine constructivist learning through doing with design-based approaches of ethnographic action research, open portfolio, and artifact-based interviews.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pinpointing these genetic mutations and understanding the environmental conditions that favor changes in breeding system are of great interest to both evolutionary biologists and plant breeders. The plant genus Schiedea (carnation family, Caryophyllaceae) is only found on the Hawaiian Islands and is a model to better understand the evolution of breeding strategies in plants. Among the 32 species of Schiedea, some only breed with other individuals of the same species, others only self-fertilize, and others still are transitional between the two. Additionally, different outbreeding species of Schiedea use different pollinators, including a recently discovered moth found only in Hawaii. This project will apply cutting-edge DNA sequencing and analysis methods to reconstruct the genealogy of Scheidea and investigate the evolution of plant breeding strategies within the group. Data from this project will provide new insights into the evolution of plant breeding strategies that could be applied to crop species in the carnation family, including amaranth, rhubarb, quinoa and spinach. The project incorporates extensive opportunities for education and training at multiple levels, including high school teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher. The project will produce educational videos about Hawaiian plants for posting on the internet to inform the public. Researchers will also offer public seminars about Schiedea highlighting their research findings about the group.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to reconstruct the pattern of breeding system evolution in Schiedea (Caryophyllaceae) through an integrated program of field, laboratory, and genomic studies. Nuclear genome sequencing, targeted sequence capture, and Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) methods will be used to reconstruct a highly resolved phylogenetic tree of Schiedea, identify sources of phylogenetic conflict, and investigate patterns of introgression among taxa. The phylogenetic hypotheses developed will be used to interpret the evolution of breeding systems including transitions from hermaphroditism to dioecy, shifts from biotic to abiotic pollination, and traits associated with pollination biology (including scent and nectar production). Field studies and densely distributed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) markers generated by GBS will be used to test hypotheses concerning the influence of reproductive systems on gene flow, hybridization, and population genetic structure. Data obtained during this project will be applied directly to land management in Hawaii, including the establishment of wild populations of different Schiedea species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers from heterogenous geographic locations, institutions, career stages, and demographic groups will get access to the project?s infrastructure and data. Investigators will be able to use SHIPS to identify variations in outcomes due to state institutions, history, and policies, as well as employing cutting-edge social science methods to identify causes of public beliefs. The scale of the project will allow researchers to examine public opinion not only across states, but also among specific subgroups that often evade study (e.g., people with low income or education). The project will engage students as part of the research team, as well as offering curriculum development and hands-on training. SHIPS will generate academic papers, public-facing reports, and make data trends easily digestible with interactive visualization and online dashboards.<br/><br/>The main goal of The State Health, Institutions, and Politics Survey is to provide high-quality state-level longitudinal data on public opinion, allowing researchers to track and document cross-country trends. The research team has developed and validated an approach that allows for the regular collection and post-stratification weighting of large census-balanced samples from every state and Washington, DC.  Large-scale survey waves with up to 25,000 respondents will be fielded at regular time intervals. The sample size will enable exploring heterogeneous effects and examining outcomes for small, difficult to study population subgroups. The project will also be flexible and reactive to sudden events that could prompt the need for immediate data collection. SHIPS will give scholars access to survey modules and results via a competitive application process. Half or more of the survey content fielded in each wave funded by this grant will be designed by applicants whose peer-reviewed proposals have been accepted. Successful applicants will have exclusive access to the collected data for one year, at which point it will be made public.

Community gardens have the potential to provide numerous benefits, but often face limitations such as scarce resources, limited access, lack of persistent engagement, and other challenges. The significance of this research lies in its potential to seamlessly connect physical and virtual community gardens, and enhance their experiences and values by overcoming spatial and resource limitations. Extending a physical garden into a virtual one could potentially overcome space and resource limitations. Virtual gardens may also provide new and engaging platforms to enable people to connect, share, learn, and even generate revenue. Being able to remotely monitor and manage physical gardens via a virtual platform may also provide more scheduling flexibility for residents who are pressured to fulfill other time-demanding duties, or during extreme events such as lockdowns due to pandemics. This innovative approach benefits society by addressing challenges facing traditional community gardens and expanding their potential in terms of community learning, engagement, and well-being.<br/><br/>The research endeavors to identify design opportunities and potential social benefits of the meta-garden through participatory design workshops, develop a technical strategy, and create functional prototypes for physical and virtual augmentations of a community garden. Moreover, it aims to conduct pilot tests with community partners and summarize design guidelines for future implementation. On the technical front, the research involves mapping out relevant functional features, formulating technical development strategies, developing preliminary functional prototypes, and evaluating system performance. These processes are informed by specific research questions targeting technical aspects such as key technical features, approaches for augmentation, technical gaps, challenges, and potential solutions. From a social perspective, the research employs a research-through-design approach involving participatory design workshops, semi-structured interviews, and reflective thematic analysis. These methods are guided by questions that explore the social benefits and challenges of the meta-garden concept and how it can enhance community experiences. Collectively, these endeavors serve to explore how meta-gardens, facilitated by this planning grant, could redefine community gardens to be more inclusive, accessible, and impactful. The potential for these mixed-reality gardens may even stretch beyond the community garden context, with possibilities for enhancing agricultural management, environmental quality monitoring, urban and rural planning, and more.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the success of these devices, the potential for bioelectrical and biophotonic devices has scarcely been realized, limited in part by challenges in interfacing devices with living tissues and the potential tissue damage due to device insertion. This future manufacturing seed grant will develop new manufacturing methods to create electronic and photonic devices that are biocompatible (i.e., able to facilitate growth and function of healthy biological tissues) and are bio-resilient (i.e., able to withstand the wet, salty, proteinaceous chemical environment of biological systems). In addition, it will address how to interface the living tissue with electronic and photonic devices so that information (e.g., brain electrical signals, muscle stimulation, neuronal responses) can be transferred between the electronic or photonic device and the living system. This project will build on existing advanced technical education programs in semiconductor technologies and biomedical advanced technologies to identify the core competencies required for the field of manufacturing and train a workforce at the community college, bachelors, masters, and doctoral degree level, broadening participation through our interactions with community college partners and engaging with industry to ensure that the curriculum developed remains responsive to industry needs. Finally, a detailed curriculum based upon core competencies identified by the project team in conjunction with the Industrial Advisory Board will be developed and piloted at key community colleges and in bachelors and masters level programs at SUNY Polytechnic Institute and Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.

To identify the barriers to addressing these challenges at the manufacturing scale, the project will include preliminary research focused on two testbeds: 1) Implementation of a pressure sensing device that can measure outflow from ocular tissues to address development of glaucoma therapeutics; 2) Creation of multielectrode arrays interfaced with three-dimensional cell cultures (e.g., neuronal organoids) for electrical stimulation and observation. A significant focus in these testbed experiments will be on design for manufacturability, to enable the transition from laboratory devices to manufactured devices.

Although these bacteria have fewer than 2000 genes, they thrive in bogs, algae-choked lakes, pristine alpine ponds, rivers, estuaries, and reservoirs. To understand how bacteria with so few genes are able to dominate in such a diverse range of environments, we propose to develop genome-editing tools in two easy-to-work-with species of freshwater Actinobacteria. The work proposed here, and the research that builds on it, will enable scientists working on freshwater carbon cycling, bacterial-algal interactions, heterotrophy, and light capture to identify the genes in freshwater Actinobacteria that contribute to these processes. That work, in turn, will provide experimental data linking genes to ecosystem functions. <br/><br/>Laboratory research on the physiology and metabolism of freshwater clades of Actinobacteria has been hampered by having only a few cultivated species, none with available genome editing tools.

Targeted mutagenesis will enable not just inactivation of specific genes, but also insertion of genes for heterologous expression from the chromosome. Random transposon-based mutagenesis will enable construction of comprehensive mutant libraries that can be screened for fitness under a variety of different environmentally relevant stresses.

They are mostly employed in conventional energy storage applications as secondary power source, such as microprocessors and solar batteries. They have also been demonstrated as efficient energy devices in oscillators and filters circuits, fractional-order controllers, and fractional-order resonators. However, because of the nature and porous structure of their electrodes and the interfacial electrochemistry of their electrodes/electrolyte phase, many fundamental aspects of their performance metrics are still not well understood, and rational design is practically nonexistent. In particular, EDLCs exhibit a dissipative, resistive-capacitive behavior when operating away from dc with an impedance angle anywhere between -90 and 0 deg. In this project, miniaturized EDLCs based on structured 2D and 3D electrode arrays will be designed and fabricated with the objective of understanding and controlling their non-ideal, fractional-order behavior. We will develop and study the effect of doped electrolytes in order to tune the electric-field-induced ionic transport in the presence of physical obstacles. The expected outcome is a general procedure and design rules to apply in order to fine-tune and control the impedance phase shift of EDLCs and their energy-power performance. Modeling and simulation using mean-field Poisson-Nernst-Plank model will be carried out in order to provide a fundamental understanding of the frequency response of the devices. System-level modeling using fractional-order mathematical tools and equivalent circuit models will also be developed in connection with RC-based circuitry. The controllable fractional-order behavior of the EDLCs will be verified and their frequency-domain application will be demonstrated.

With support from the Biosensing Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, the research groups of Prof. Shaoting Lin (Michigan State University), Prof. Chenglin Wu (Missouri University of Science and Technology), and Prof. Xinyue Liu (Michigan State University) aim to overcome these challenges by developing in-situ hydrogel-MXene biosensors capable of detecting low-level CRC biomarkers (e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)) in simulated intestinal environments. The in-situ hydrogel-MXene biosensor will potentially lead to a big leap in bioelectronics, offering transformative impacts in disease diagnostics and paving the way for personalized healthcare. In addition, this project is expected to foster the development of the next-generation workforce in emerging biotechnologies through multi-institutional and interdisciplinary efforts including the integration of new topics in undergraduate courses and the promotion of STEM fields to encourage more students to engage in these areas of study.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to integrate selective-permeable hydrogels with MXene-based field-effect transistors for developing high-performance hydrogel-MXene biosensors that can achieve in-situ detection of low-level colorectal cancer (CRC) biomarkers (e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)) in simulated intestinal environments while mitigating the influence of mobile ions. To achieve this, this project will leverage molecular design of reversible interaction, network topology, and fixed charge in hydrogels to modulate hydrogel-intestine interactions for selective biomolecular transport and to regulate hydrogel-MXene interactions for improved field-effect sensing performance. Specifically, this project will leverage the synergy of network elasticity and reversible interaction in hydrogels to independently modulate the transport of target and non-target biomolecules, thereby enabling selective and enhanced transport. In addition, this project will harness the combined efforts of molecular design, atomic simulation, and DFT calculation to optimize the design of network topology and fixed charge density of hydrogels, thus maximizing the Debye length, reduce the capacitance, and tune the bandgap at the hydrogel-MXene interface. Finally, this project will incorporate the explored hydrogel design principles to build a high-performing hydrogel-MXene biosensor capable of quantifying CRC biomarkers in simulated intestinal environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, hydrogen is a cost-effective energy storage solution for intermittent renewable electricity generation and when long-term seasonal energy storage is required. Meeting ambitious goals of greenhouse gas and carbon emission reduction necessitates the maturation of electrochemical technologies that generate, store, and distribute hydrogen. This project seeks to understand how electrode polymeric binder materials in electrochemical hydrogen pumps (EHPs) affect the efficiency performance for hydrogen purification from challenging gas mixtures that contain low hydrogen concentrations (1% to 20%). This is important because it is posited that U.S.?s existing natural gas pipelines may have the ability to store and distribute hydrogen from centralized production facilities. Leveraging existing infrastructure can reduce the cost of hydrogen to end users as hydrogen storage and distribution make up a large portion of the cost of hydrogen today. However, endpoint use applications necessitate pure hydrogen at high pressures. Hence, EHPs are promising technology to separate hydrogen from gas mixtures while simultaneously compressing it. Advancing materials? performance and durability for electrochemical hydrogen pumps, such as electrode binders, can reduce capital costs for EHPs while also improving their energy efficiency. Electrochemical processes are poised to decarbonize chemical processes and is paramount to train future engineers proficient in electrochemical engineering and electrochemical systems integration. This project will commission the first electrochemical unit operation, an EHP, in Penn State?s Unit Operations Laboratory to give students hands-on training with electrochemical systems. Outreach activities for this project will engage and recruit individuals from rural communities in central Pennsylvania to teach them about sustainable chemical manufacturing using electrochemical systems.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this fundamental research project aims to understand how electrode ionomer binders? composition and processing influence hydrogen diffusivity and hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction kinetics in high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane (HT-PEM) electrochemical hydrogen pumps (EHPs). With the advent of ion-pair HT-PEMs and phosphonic acid ionomer electrode binders, preliminary experiments demonstrated hydrogen separations from syngas, and other reformed hydrocarbons with varying hydrogen and carbon monoxide concentrations, to +99.3% hydrogen at 1 A cm-2. In these experiments, it was observed that cell polarization was largely governed by hydrogen content in the gas mixture feed because CO poisoning was minimized. Addressing EHP cell polarization with gas feeds containing low hydrogen content requires new electrode binders that promote hydrogen diffusivity and foster better electrocatalyst utilization. This project will establish structure-property relationships that correlate ionomer composition and processing to reaction kinetics-transport properties. These ionomer electrochemical properties will be probed as thin films on interdigitated electrode arrays decorated with nanoscale electrocatalysts afforded from block copolymer templating. EHP studies with membrane electrode assemblies containing the new ionomers will be used for understanding cell polarization behavior for purifying hydrogen from gas mixtures with low hydrogen content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These conversations will serve as a means to identify disciplinary knowledge, including needs and benefits, at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI. The group will work to identify ways to engage middle school students and their teachers in learning about AI, cybersecurity, and the intersections between them. By including this array of voices, the project will generate knowledge about the differences and similarities between industry and academic expectations. The discussion will also drive the development of a survey that can be used to determine what students know about AI and cybersecurity as well as a proof-of-concept instructional module that addresses one of the identified gaps in knowledge. The project team will also document the process for building this interdisciplinary community of practice to focus on a single issue in ways that shape students? educational experiences.

In particular, such concerns exist for applications that collect private user information, as in health monitoring, e-commerce, and financial services, and applications associated with critical infrastructure as in transportation, smart grids, or process supervisory management systems. Indeed, for these applications, a single compromised/malicious agent or node of the network can provoke catastrophic events such as ransom payments to recover private data, large-scale electricity blackouts, interruptions of service, data breaches, financial losses, or fatalities. This project aims to explore how distributing the authority to launch critical tasks in the hands of multiple, rather than a single, nodes or users of the network can be an efficient means to avoid having a single point of failure and hence losing private data in its entirety in the case of a security breach. Furthermore, the proposed research studies how authority distribution is able to empower networks with the capability of coping with compromised devices or persons before they are identified as malicious and, most importantly, before they are able to do any harm.<br/><br/>The project investigates novel solutions beyond traditional threshold cryptography to address challenging roadblocks in authority distribution for data access and biometric authentication. Specifically, the project aims to overcome (i) privacy challenges with the use of biometrics, (ii) the need for costly resources as perfectly secure communication channels, (iii) a poor scaling behavior with the number of users, and (iv) the need for a central entity which is not compatible with distributed systems, to unravel fundamental trade-offs between privacy and storage requirements. The project comprises three interrelated thrusts. The first thrust studies the fundamental security and privacy guarantees that authority distribution can offer in the presence of, potentially unnoticed, compromised users or nodes. The second thrust investigates the construction of low-complexity coding schemes for authority distribution that operate at finite blocklengths, based on novel methods derived from error control coding and cryptography.

Yet, there remains a gap between educational preparation and industry?s recognition of potential workers who have completed two-year biotechnology programs. Over the next ten years, reports predict that life science companies will have an increased demand for skilled technical workers, and that filling these positions will be difficult.  Thus, preparation of sufficient biotechnicians represents a significant need for the biological economy and related sectors. This project aims to bridge the gap between education and industry through an industry-recognized biotechnician credentialing system. Recently, the Bioscience Industry has identified the Biotechnician Assistant Credentialing Exam (BACE) as an effective tool to certify student capabilities.  This exam is already used in six states and the District of Columbia, thus increasing its potential to become the industry-recognized credentialing system for entry-level biotechnicians. This project will pilot the BACE system in five additional states, build consortia of industry and education stakeholders, and disseminate BACE broadly through InnovATEBIO (an NSF ATE Center of Excellence) and the Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing of Cell-based Therapies (an Advanced Technical Education Coordination Network). A nationwide industry-recognized credentialing system will give students a portable credential that is recognized across the nation, thus helping to address the workforce gap in the life science industry. This credentialing model may also inform credentialing approaches for other areas of technician education.<br/><br/>The BACE credential was developed through engagement of educators with industry and industry representatives.  This partnership continues to evaluate the credential to ensure that it meets changing industry needs. This project intends to expand the number of states using the BACE by adding Georgia, Washington, California, Texas, and Nebraska.  To this end, it will set up state task forces comprised of industry professionals, educational leaders, and government representatives.  Each task force will examine the use and sustainability of BACE in their state. Testing sites will be established in each state, and the sites will provide faculty and teachers with professional development to understand the BACE, so they can support students? exam preparation. The project will leverage the extensive networks of InnovATEBIO and the Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing of Cell-based Therapies to disseminate the BACE credential, and also disseminate it through national and state industry associations, district-level industry advisory boards, boards of education, technical educators, and government officials. A nationally recognized credential has strong potential to improve the transition from two-year college technician education programs to employment in the biotechnology industry. This result would not only serve the industry, but also serve the emerging workforce by identifying skillsets in demand across the country.

Compared to the terrestrial cellular base stations, drones equipped with wireless transceivers can serve as mobile base stations, and stand out in providing highly on-demand services with flexible 3D mobility, better wireless connectivity with higher chance of Line-of-Sight links, and much lower deployment cost with almost infrastructure-free network construction. Promising as it is, drone based communication networks still face fundamental regulation challenges: i) as drones are highly mobile, the dynamically changing network topology may make it unpractical for a centralized control unit to collect complete network information and make collective decisions; ii) the environment in which drones operate may be dynamically changing or unexplored without a priori knowledge of the environment modeling, making the conventional optimization or rule-based methods hardly applicable; iii) the research is still embryonic on how to optimally regulate the drone network when the lineup of the serving drones dynamically change, which, however, will be a common event in realistic implementation. To this end, this proposal is aimed to crack the nut of the above identified issues, and develop an effective framework for distributed network regulation solutions that are environment-model-free and well adaptive to the dynamic drone lineup. The research outcomes are expected to provide valuable inspirations and benchmarking to the distributed, scalable, and artificial-intelligence powered management of aerial access communication networks under a dynamic network setup. Such networks will be embraced as a key component in the larger-scope Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks for the beyond-5G mobile telecommunications. The success of the project will potentially contribute to the leadership and competence of the United States worldwide in future generation mobile telecommunications as well as elevating national communication welfare with more integrated and on-demand communication infrastructure.<br/><br/>In this project, multi-agent reinforcement learning will be applied to establish a distributed and model-free network regulation framework. The framework will feature strong capability in making sequential decisions in complex time-varying environments. Under the developed framework, the project aims to investigate how the drone communication networks should responsively handle and further proactively control the dynamic change of the drone lineup in a distributed yet coordinated manner. Specifically, responsive strategies will be first designed for a general drone communication network. The strategies will jointly optimize the radio resource management and trajectory design for the drones when the drone lineup change dynamically. The learning algorithm design will be investigated with different levels of inter-drone information exchange. The learning exploration will be promoted by adopting the structure of asynchronous parallel computing. The network will be prototyped leveraging on programmable drone products and simple-yet-effective communication protocols. To move one step further, proactive control strategies will be derived for the solar-powered self-sustainable drone communication network, which proactively control the quit and join-in of the drones by pre-shaping their solar-charging plan. The strategies will consider dynamic user spatial and traffic distributions by combining Fourier analysis, Long-Short Term Memory and Gaussian process regression for distribution prediction, and enabling predicting while learning to significantly reduce the reinforcement learning complexity. The hybrid cooperative-compete relationship among individual drones will be handled by exploiting Nash Q learning and correlated Q learning. The anxiety on the high-dimension state-action space in learning will be relieved by adopting problem decomposition techniques. The proposed project will advance the research on autonomous regulation of drone communication networks by filling the gaps of missing control strategy design to responsively handle and proactively control the drone lineup change. In addition, the introduction of game theory into the distributed framework makes the research more realistic with diversified autonomy in individual drones. The prototyping plan will complement the simulation evaluation on the time complexity and communication overhead/latency in the real-world implementation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this CAREER project is to develop a single-molecule high-speed nanoelectronic platform to better understand the function of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated enzymes known as ""molecular scissors"".  These enzymes allow gene editing and have revolutionized many basic and applied research areas.

As part of this vision, this project focuses on the integration of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) with high bandwidth graphene field effect transistors (gFETs) designed for single-molecule sensing. The platform provides unique electronic signatures representing the molecular interactions that happen concurrently between the CRISPR and target DNA/RNA at different timescales. The CRISPR-Cas system is a family of RNA guided enzymes that is widely used for gene editing as it is capable of double-stranded DNA binding and cleavage, producing insertions and deletions (INDELs) at specific loci within the genome in vivo. The application areas of CRISPR technology are rapidly extending beyond genome editing, such as targeted gene regulation, in vivo imaging, epigenetic modulation as well as nucleic acid detection for diagnostic applications. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to provide a tool to evaluate the enzymatic activity of newly discovered or engineered CRISPR-Cas enzymes to better understand their biology and the impact of CRISPR-Cas mutagenesis, guide RNA modifications as well as genetic variation of the target on their functions. Successful development of the single molecule high bandwidth gFET for CRISPR analysis coupled with trained machine learning models, will provide a tool for detailed analysis of the CRISPR interactions with its target sequence in terms of binding, cleavage, and release of the target in real-time as well as identification of the variables most important for predicting CRISPR function.

A well-established measure of the location and intensity of mid-latitude storms uses the temporal variance of wind velocity within a certain frequency band. There are two areas of large variance, extending from the East Coasts of Asia and North America out into the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans respectively, and the location of these ""storm tracks"" and their intensities vary from year to year. However, the measured configurations and strength of the storm tracks are sensitive to the choice of frequency band, and there are currently no data-driven techniques for identifying frequency bands that appropriately characterize trends in wind velocity variability. Understanding the relative strength of higher frequencies (cyclone growth and propagation) vs. lower frequencies (cyclone occlusion and decay) as a function of location and season, as well as long-term trends in the locations and characteristics of storm tracks, aids climate researchers in assessing spatial and time trends in atmospheric conditions. This project aims to develop data-driven procedures to enhance this effort by establishing optimal summary measures for characterizing differences in wind velocity trends among frequencies. The research team will develop, validate, and openly share software and analytical tools for adaptive frequency band estimation that adequately summarizes time-varying dynamics and accounts for the complex interaction between the spatial and temporal dependence in atmospheric conditions. In addition, the project includes professional training through a transdisciplinary program in atmospheric sciences and computational and theoretical statistics. The activities include supervision of doctoral theses and undergraduate capstone projects, as well as talks for local high school students interested in research at the intersection of statistics and atmospheric sciences.<br/><br/>The frequency-domain properties of nonstationary functional time series often contain valuable information. These properties are characterized through their time-varying power spectra. Practitioners seeking low-dimensional summary measures of the power spectrum often partition frequencies into bands and create collapsed measures of power within these bands. However, standard frequency bands may not provide adequate summary measures of the power spectrum. There is need for a standardized, quantitative approach to objectively identify frequency bands that can best summarize spectral information, which for nonstationary functional time series is especially challenging due to the high dimensionality. This project seeks to establish a new data-driven framework for adaptive frequency band estimation for nonstationary functional time series that adequately summarizes the time varying dynamics of the series and simultaneously accounts for the complex interaction between the functional and temporal dependence structures. The three specific aims associated with this effort are: (1) to develop methodology for local frequency band estimation of a nonstationary functional time series that best preserves nonstationary spectral information localized within the functional domain, (2) to develop new methodology for local frequency band estimation of a multivariate nonstationary functional time series that best preserves the joint nonstationary spectral information among multiple functional time series localized within the functional domain, and (3) to develop new approaches for multivariate frequency band estimation of a nonstationary functional time series that best preserves nonstationary spectral information localized within a multidimensional frequency domain. Theoretical validity of these procedures will be established, and computationally efficient estimation procedures will be designed to ensure scalability. Extensive simulation studies will be conducted to explore the empirical and computational properties of the new methods, which are expected to enhance understanding of hidden mechanisms behind storm dynamics and thereby contribute to enhanced resilience to adverse climatic events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex systems are networks comprising many collaborating elements that continuously interact with each other in a nonlinear and counterintuitive manner; examples include cybersecurity, manufacturing processes, automated transportation infrastructure, medical devices, and many others relevant to our well-being. Faults in these systems are malfunctions, such as cyber-attack or sensor failure, that break security, degrade system functionality, and cause safety concerns and economic losses. Control of these systems is challenging because the dynamic behavior of the ensemble is intrinsically difficult to predict. This award supports fundamental research to build a ?fault-aware? control framework to study how interactions among individual elements produce the collective?s dynamics and how to alleviate the effect of faults on complex systems. To develop and test the control framework, a failing heart managed by a ventricular assist device will be used as the foundation to (i) detect device faults such as thrombosis and suction that jeopardize the survival of heart failure patients and (ii) automatically adjust the operation of the device under faults to improve the patient quality of life. The educational and outreach plan will focus on promoting active and life-long learning and engaging and training students at various levels, including veterans transitioning to civilian life, in emerging industries and transdisciplinary skills.<br/><br/>Using machine learning as the backbone, the objective of this research is to create a data-driven control strategy that regulates and maintains the system?s homeostasis following the onset of faults, while ensuring the system continues to operate in a seamless, continuous manner. This research will fill the knowledge gap for the supervision and control of complex systems when the governing phenomena are unknown and when first principle models are not readily attainable. The data-driven strategy will also overcome design limitations. Designing complex systems, such as ventricular assist devices, based on first principle models is costly, time consuming, and requires extensive expert knowledge to build application-specific models based on ubiquitous assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in practice. This research project will integrate data analytics, control theory, and machine learning into a unified framework with three innovative aspects: developing machine learning methods to discover symptomatic fingerprints of faults directly from data for real-time fault diagnosis; building an online adaptive modeling paradigm to predict performance-related variables that are not directly measurable due to economic considerations or technical constraints; designing a fault-tolerant controller to improve the system?s performance, while ensuring all operational constraints are met. In addition to its application to ventricular assist devices, this framework can be applied to protect computer systems from digital attacks, improve manufacturing efficiency, and address safety issues in automated transportation infrastructure and medical devices, leading to compelling societal and economic benefits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this emerging field, educating the workforce and broadening participation in QISE now are crucial to prepare future generations for related emerging technology fields and enabling the development of QISE practical applications. Five universities ? the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Middle Tennessee State University, Tennessee Tech, Fisk University, and Auburn University ? have assembled a team of experts to provide QISE training to community colleges and universities in the Southeast, including first-generation college students, women, and historically underrepresented populations in STEM.<br/><br/>The project will focus on four main thrusts: experiential learning in QISE, QISE workforce development, fostering regional QISE partnerships, and broadening QISE participation. The teaching model embraces three elements: a tailored quantum computing curriculum, experiential learning, and a strong mentorship network. The curriculum culminates in a multi-tier online certificate program, providing learners with the flexibility needed to master technical nuances at their own pace. Theoretical learning is complemented by a hands-on approach via workshops, faculty-guided research, and exposure to national labs and industry experiences. By establishing a replicable methodology for experiential learning, the project serves as a blueprint for similar programs where access to QISE education remains limited. To ensure sustainability, the project will actively engage local, regional, and national companies, labs, and organizations.

This project develops program-analysis-centric techniques that enable the investigation and remediation of ongoing infections as well as hardening against future CMS compromises, with the goals of 1) understanding the intent and strategy of a CMS infection and tracing their root-cause attack vector for reliable remediation, 2) revealing dynamic and sophisticated attack behaviors in malware samples in a CMS infection, 3) hardening of CMS deployments against future attacks. This project benefits national security and economic stability by creating cyber forensics and vulnerability detection techniques for CMS websites and the financial, government, and private sector operations they support. It provides server-side script code including malicious scripts and vulnerable code to help train next-generation cybersecurity experts. Students from underrepresented minority groups are involved in research activities.<br/><br/>This project develops Doctor WHO, a CMS analysis framework which combines rapid evidence collection and advanced program analysis techniques for the investigation and remediation of infections and hardening against future CMS compromises. Specifically, the data-driven prediction framework, called TARDIS, is developed to understand the temporal correlation of attack evidence across a corpus of real-world websites. TARDIS enables the automated discovery of the artifacts of a compromise, fingerprinting of the attack's propagation, and rapid investigation of cyberattacks against CMS deployments. The project also develops Torchwood, a cross-language and cross-environment program analysis framework to effectively analyze highly dynamic and sophisticated malware targeting CMSs. Torchwood can handle advanced obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques applied to malware and reveal hidden malicious behaviors and intentions of the malware effectively. Lastly, the project develops UNIT that enables the hardening and securing of CMS deployments against future attacks. UNIT accomplishes this by enabling automated dynamic testing of CMS-backed websites without requiring any runtime environment resources. UNIT eliminates false alerts and provide proof-of-concept exploits via a set of new methods to identify and model dependencies of runtime resources and reconstruct missing resources using instrumented script interpreter engines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New levels of product complexity/customization not offered by traditional manufacturing processes are now achievable, resulting in weight reduction, enhanced conformability, joint consolidation, and higher efficiencies through design. This project combines faculty in engineering, chemistry, architecture, and geology to innovate a solar-powered compression/curing technique that additively fabricates building materials made of tung oil and local sands for sustainable, raw-earth construction. This manufacturing method can leverage available natural resources within the U.S., therefore reducing any reliance on international raw materials.

However, disruptions and transitions of routines, such as moving, job changes, or family illness, can interfere with their ability to stick to their goals. When these transitions happen, they might influence how individuals access healthy eating resources or create challenges for people to maintain their healthy eating behavior outside their established routine. Transitions may also create new needs or change people?s priorities around healthy eating. However, current personal informatics technology is typically designed based on the assumption that everyday behavior remains static. As a result, when transitions happen in everyday life, existing technologies struggle to help people assess and adapt to the changing needs, constraints, and priorities.

Since RL can provide optimized policies to achieve certain goals, people are eager to use advanced RL techniques to solve real-world decision-making problems. Despite its huge success in AI domains, RL has not yet shown the same degree of success for real-world applications because RL largely relies on simulation, and there is rarely a good simulator for real-world systems. Unlike simulated environments such as games where data could be unlimited, real-world physical systems like traffic systems are quite the opposite: data is small (i.e., sparse and hard to obtain). This raises important research questions about building realistic simulations from small data that can mimic complex and stochastic real-world dynamics. The solution from this project can help policymakers choose a better policy before implementing it in the real world, greatly facilitate the adoption of reinforcement learning techniques in the real world, and benefit many applications in which one would like to use real data to learn or understand real-world physical systems better.<br/><br/>This project aims to build a realistic traffic simulator by investigating data mining algorithms and provides solutions toward mimicking real-world simulations with small data with applications to traffic simulations.

Live media have the ability to stream video and afford interaction by participants. Previously, live media afforded audience participation through text-based chat. Now, new live media forms and democratizing systems have progressively enabled viewers to participate more directly and collectively. Participatory design incorporates stakeholders in the design process to provide subject-matter expertise and surface issues; however, prior approaches work with small, co-located groups with banal results. The work draws on playing out design fiction - imagining technology futures in service to designing systems well and equitably - as part of the design process. We can envision a future wherein live media affords participation not only for entertainment, but to shape the future of a specific design, a field, or an entire industry. Further, rendering a design fiction system into an interactive artifact holds promise to make these imagined systems more real for potential users. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to establish new methodologies that broaden participation of diverse stakeholders in designing new technologies, enabling participatory design at scale while evaluating how best to use live data to iterate designs and uncover design principles for live media collaboration and active involvement. To better support building future systems for specialized, geographically distributed populations, innovative and realistic simulation methods and tools will be developed. LPDF will facilitate participatory design at distance and scale by asking participants to play out a role in a design fiction, in this case one focused on the future of information technology in emergency management. This project will iteratively develop LPDF methods and tools, building on an existing live media platform. In parallel, it will develop scenarios, grounded in practice, for design fictions to be developed within the emergency management domain to foster technology integration and influence systems being designed on other projects. The project's broader impacts will come through releasing and promoting open-source tools for doing LPDF that support designers and researchers, impacting emergency management practice through system designs, releasing reusable scenarios based on practice, and developing educational resources for doing LPDF in conference courses and college classes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prosthetic hands that can significantly improve the quality of amputees? life are highly desired to restore many activities of daily living, particularly in hand grasping and object manipulation. However, being able to use the hand accurately remains a grand and fundamental challenge in robotic prosthetic hands, especially in the desired trait of slip prevention for reliable and stable grasping in real life environments. The challenge resides in integrating fast sensing of slip detection and rapid movement in the small-area in the fingertips to prevent slippage through the use of sensors and controls of the prosthetic hands. This project proposes to meet this challenge by exploring a new concept of a skin that can change its shape for prosthetic hands in real-time. For this research project, the investigators will explore how to adjust the skin friction automatically. This project seeks to significantly advance the current state-of-the-art prosthetic hands to achieve the similar functionality of human hands, as well as enhance the ability of upper limb amputees for performing activities of daily living. Through both collaborative and individual efforts of the interdisciplinary team with distributed geographical location across the country (Raleigh, Philadelphia, and Rolla), this NSF project offers a unique opportunity to integrate insights from robotics, mechanics, design, advanced manufacturing to generate an intriguing and visually appealing broad participation plan. Through existing programs, such as senior design projects, Society of Women Engineering, honor program, and UNC Working on Women in Science, the investigators will encourage underrepresented groups of undergraduate students in research activities, including female and African American students.

The long-term goal of the Plant Cell Atlas (PCA) community is to build a comprehensive map of the locations, interactions, and functions of molecules in plant cells and tissues to accelerate both fundamental research and meeting societal challenges. The PCA community will set standards for generating and integrating large plant data sets that will ultimately contribute to the foundation of synthesizing how biology works at the cellular level. The RCN will establish and nurture the community that will ultimately generate data and infrastructure for the PCA. This RCN will also provide excellent networking and interdisciplinary training opportunities for early career scientists and outreach to K-12 students and the general public about the importance and fascination of plants. The PCA community will emphasize broadening participation of scientists and students from underserved communities by providing financial support for participating in workshops and events and establishing a strong presence on campuses of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) via a travelling scientific art exhibit, among other initiatives. Future generations of scientists trained by the RCN will pioneer innovative and sustainable solutions to mitigate and overcome food, materials, and energy shortages expected to result from climate change.<br/><br/>Many questions in fundamental, translational, and applied plant biology await answers, requiring both new data and analytical frameworks that make connections among disparate data types. Rapid advances in technologies are being made in synthetic biology, genome engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, structural biology, mass spectrometry, and microscopy. These technologies are being applied to plants to dissect the functions and interactions of specialized cell types and their capacity to respond to environmental stresses, host symbioses, and to produce useful products. However, the information provided by these new technologies will be most powerful if it is integrated and standardized to provide fresh insights into the functional connections among diverse biomolecules, to suggest new hypotheses for cellular functions, and to model cellular processes. The community established through this RCN will pioneer the integration of large, diverse plant datasets into a Plant Cell Atlas that will ultimately enable innovative and sustainable solutions to the challenges expected from climate change. The RCN will: 1) develop rubrics for defining plant cell types; 2) provision networking and training opportunities for the PCA community, especially for early career participants through workshops, webinars, and symposia; 3) establish guidelines and best practices for data integration, resulting in standardized data collection protocols and analysis methods; 4) facilitate the generation of new methods for image annotation/analysis driven by connections to the artificial intelligence community; 5) develop the PCA website as a central platform where scientists can find experimental protocols, community standards, and links to available resources; and 6) foster collaborations on research and grant applications for generating data, developing tools, and creating computational infrastructures.

For example, water electrolysis ? the splitting of water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen gases ? requires catalysts for both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Catalyst design has historically been driven by an understanding of bulk material properties; however, the surface where reactions occur can change dramatically in the reaction environment. The project explores relationships between bulk and surface catalytic properties of perovskite materials as a pathway to efficient, sustainable, hydrogen production via electrocatalytic water splitting ? thereby enabling the hydrogen economy.  Additionally, the project develops related courses designed to train students in electrochemical devices for energy conversion and storage, while promoting outreach to underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>This project illuminates relationships between perovskite material bulk template and surface properties, during and following electrocatalytic reactions.

The primary drivers of transformations at functional interfaces will be identified - considering not only the role of materials composition (and associated electronic structure), but also two-dimensional templating from strain imposed by the underlying lattice, and three-dimensional templating from the presence of defects such as mobile cations and oxygen vacancies. Additionally, both the magnitude and length scale of charge transfer between the bulk and surface layer will be investigated.  The project will combine atomically precise materials synthesis with surface-sensitive element-specific spectroscopy and microscopy, considering the family of (001)-oriented perovskite oxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Springs rich in hydrogen sulfide represent some of the most extreme freshwater environments because hydrogen sulfide halts energy production in animal cells. Nonetheless, some fish have colonized sulfide springs throughout the Americas and have evolved into new species in the process. This project will investigate how the genetic changes that mediate the fish's ability to tolerate hydrogen sulfide impact their ability to successfully interbreed with related fish that live in adjacent freshwater streams. It involves the identification of genetic differences between hydrogen sulfide-tolerant and susceptible populations, particularly in genes associated with pathways affected by hydrogen sulfide toxicity. In addition, it will be tested how hybrids between tolerant and susceptible populations differ from their parents. Specifically, the function of mitochondria and whole organisms will be compared between parents and hybrids in presence or absence of hydrogen sulfide. This project will yield new insights into how adaptation to environmental stress leads to genetic incompatibilities that represent barriers for interbreeding between populations, and thus, into how new species form. This project provides training opportunities in integrative biology for participants at all levels of higher education. It will also contribute to science education and public outreach by training scientists to become effective science communicators and reach non-expert audiences in collaboration with informal education institutions. <br/><br/>Natural selection drives adaptive evolution and can cause speciation. However, the potential role of intrinsic genetic incompatibilities during speciation with gene flow remains largely unknown. Investigating speciation with gene flow in the context of physiological adaptation allows closing existing gaps of knowledge. This is possible through integrated analyses of how selection shapes genomic divergence, how recombination of divergent genomes in hybrids affects physiological function, and how these functional consequences affect the speciation process. This project tests a priori predictions about the links between physiological adaptation to toxic hydrogen sulfide and the emergence of reproductive isolation. It will focus on components of a highly conserved metabolic pathway, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which plays a central role in adaptation to hydrogen sulfide. Because OXPHOS components are encoded by both the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes, theory predicts that adaptive modification of OXPHOS should give rise to mitonuclear incompatibilities and contribute to the speciation process. This project investigates the mechanistic links between physiological adaptation and speciation by testing a priori predictions about (1) how OXPHOS adaptation affects genomic divergence between populations living in different environments, (2) the functional consequences of mitonuclear incompatibilities at the biochemical, physiological, and organismal levels, and (3) the relative role of mitonuclear incompatibilities during speciation. The project employs an integrative approach that combines population genomics, assays of enzyme, organelle, and whole organism function, as well as field and laboratory experiments for the quantification of multiple pre- and postzygotic mechanisms of reproductive isolation.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by BIO/Emerging Frontiers, DEB/Evolutionary Processes, and IOS/Integrative Ecological Physiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, their extensive use leads to soil and water pollution. Therefore, there is a need to find alternative and sustainable sources of nitrogen to aid crop growth. Legumes (e.g., soybean, Medicago, common bean) develop unique symbiotic relationships with a group of bacteria called rhizobia that convert atmospheric nitrogen to a chemical form available to support the host plant?s growth and reproduction. This biological process, called nodulation, is economically important and benefits agricultural sustainability and food security. Legume nodulation starts with the infection of the plant root hair cell by rhizobia. Although this cell type is found in all flowering plants, in only a subset of plants, among them legumes, is the root hair cell capable of initiating this symbiotic relationship. While several legume genes involved in this process have been characterized, a better understanding of the genetic programs controlling root hair infection is needed before considering the transfer of nodulation capacity to non-legume crop plants. The investigators in this project will characterize these genetic programs using plant single-cell technologies. In addition to its impact on our understanding of legume nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation, this project will promote the integration between research and education by supporting the development of unique educational programs dedicated to STEM high-school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project is built on the hypothesis that plant cell differentiation, gain of biological functions, and response to external stimuli are controlled by evolutionarily conserved transcriptional modules. Focusing on the biology of legume root hair cells and their response to rhizobia inoculation, this project will address three key questions: What dynamic changes occur in the legume root hair transcriptome at different stages of their infection by rhizobia? What is the level of conservation of these programs among legumes after their divergence over 50 million years and after recent (5-10 million years) polyploidy in soybean? What is the contribution of chromatin accessibility in controlling the dynamic changes of the transcriptomic programs in response to root hair infection by rhizobia? To answer these questions, the investigators will analyze in detail the molecular mechanisms associated with the early stages of the nodulation process by using the Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression technology on isolated legume root hair cells. Accessing changes in both gene activity and the profiles of chromatin accessibility will provide a deeper understanding of the dynamic response of a plant cell to microbial infection, and the level of conservation of these responses among legume species and upon whole-genome duplication.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Plant Genome Research Program and the Plant Biotic Interactions Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, decarbonizing the energy system can produce sizable health co-benefits by reducing co-emitted air pollutants. However, assessing near-term decarbonization strategies with health considerations faces two key analytical challenges: (i) unintended health co-harms from some carbon mitigation strategies; for instance, large-scale bioenergy production can drive up food prices, which leads to nutrition-related health co-harms, and (ii) deep uncertainties about the future, such as socioeconomic patterns, technology costs, and market factors. The objectives of this project are: (i) to improve the quantitative understanding of key factors and processes that determine the magnitude and distribution of health outcomes from decarbonization, and (ii) to identify features of decarbonization strategies that are most likely to yield robust net health benefits given deep future uncertainties.<br/><br/>The investigators hypothesize that while health co-benefits and co-harms are both affected by local technology choices (e.g., electricity generation technologies and vehicle types) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., income growth and population aging), the health co-harms are further determined by complex interactions across regions and sectors, such as inter-regional trade of electricity, biofuel, and food. With a focus on the United States, the investigators will test the hypothesis by: (i) developing an integrated energy-food-health modeling framework, by improving the representation of health drivers in a state-level integrated assessment model (GCAM-USA) and connecting it with a fine- resolution health impact assessment module, (ii) constructing a large-scale ensemble of decarbonization scenarios to represent a wide range of future uncertainties in socioeconomic patterns, energy technology costs, and food/energy market setups, and (iii) identifying the key factors and processes that determine health outcomes at the county, state, and national levels. By combining knowledge from energy system modeling, health impact assessment, and decision analysis, this convergent research targets improving understanding of the non-linear interactions between low-carbon energy strategies and human health, as well as the role of the market and natural systems on which these interactions depend. Thus, this project seeks to advance quantitative understanding of the complex systems governing interconnected societal challenges on energy, health, and climate. Through a convergence of various disciplines, it seeks to provide new insights on key interacting dynamics that determine health outcomes from decarbonization. Further, by leveraging modern computational capabilities to analyze a large scenario ensemble, a data-driven approach is intended to enable quantification of the relative importance of various socioeconomic, technological, and market uncertainties in determining the health co-benefits or co-harms. The project will produce open-source model code and teaching materials for research and educational purposes. It will also train undergraduate and doctoral students in a highly interdisciplinary environment.

Therefore, they must be safe at all times and on all levels, from their design to their operation. This is especially challenging since industrial control software is largely automated to make decisions on behalf of humans while being increasingly targeted by adversarial cyber-physical attacks. In order to act in advance before unsafe or undesired situations occur, models that describe the physics of the system and the effects of potential security attacks need to become a central element in designing industrial control systems. The project's novelties are mathematics- and logic-based software-development methods to make industrial control software aware of real-world effects and threats. The project's impacts are improved support for practitioners in developing trustworthy and resilient industrial control systems, with the aim of providing the crucial missing verification link between industrial control software development and execution.<br/><br/>The project's technical approach studies a provably correct development stack for industrial control systems with Programmable Logic Control (PLC) that is expected to provide a chain of fully verified links from high-level models all the way down to the running code, accompanied by synthesized correctness proofs. The correctness proofs entail strong safety guarantees on the actual industrial control system implementation through validation methods to analyze, at runtime, whether models and reality agree and to counteract when deviations occur. To this end, the team of researchers expects to advance techniques for verified runtime monitoring of the operating context and for verified bi-directional translation between code and models. The models combine differential equations with nondeterministic control and environment models to describe physical effects and security threats. Such predictive models, safety proofs, and validation methods are crucial elements of every trustworthy implementation stack so that proofs from models transfer to the running system. To address design safety at the scale of industrial control systems, the investigators bring together complementary expertise in foundations and practical verification for cyber-physical systems, with field expertise in embedded systems for industrial control systems safety and security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Feature selection has a wide range of applications, such as biomarker discovery, system monitoring, fault diagnosis, image recognition, text mining, and financial fraud detection. However, a longstanding criticism of the state of the practice in feature selection is that existing methods require empirical specifications of hyperparameters, lack the ability to search for the best feature subset, and ignore set-level feature-feature interaction. To fill the research gap, this project will develop a deep and interactive reinforced feature selection learning framework (RFSL). The project?s novelties are to propose a self-optimizing feature selection concept to achieve two goals: 1) self-optimization and 2) global optimality. The project's impacts are to improve the automation and optimality of feature selection, enrich the availability and applicability of predictive modeling that need feature selection, and advance representative biomarker discovery for biomedical applications.<br/><br/>To achieve this goal, we will address three technical challenges. The first is the framework challenges: how can we develop a machine learning framework to automate the self-optimizing feature selection while providing an effectiveness guarantee? The second is interaction challenges: which interaction mechanisms can help agents to leverage external and prior knowledge to improve learning? The Third is feedback challenges: can downstream tasks feed their intermediate results back to improve feature selection?  We will answer the questions by the following thrusts: (1) Learning Framework: a new learning framework (RFSL) will be developed to balance automation and effectiveness in self-optimizing feature selection. (2) Interactive Learning Mechanisms: an interactive perspective will be proposed to augment the external and prior knowledge learning ability of RFSL. Three novel mechanisms (i.e., action level, reward level, and environment level) will be developed to expand the interaction channels of RFSL.  (3)  Algorithm in The Loop Feedback: new approaches for algorithms in the loop will be developed to take advantage of feature tree structure feedback in a downstream predictive task to provide adaptive learning of feature selection policies to overcome distribution shifts and model drifts. (4) Embedding into Real Systems: the proposed framework will be integrated into the recently developed next-generation sequencing platform (e.g., mRNA-sequencing, whole-genome sequencing) with high-dimension low sample-size genomic data to identify robust molecular signatures to better understand the biological mechanisms behind different diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current machine learning systems do not fully grasp the structures and relationships that exist within human vision and language, and thus have difficulties producing the desired outcomes in terms of interpretability, efficiency, measurability, and causality. This project tackles the fundamental multimodal alignment problem in machine learning and will advance research in both computer vision and natural language processing, especially in the disruptive innovation areas of multimodal vision-language generation and understanding. It will lead to breakthroughs in both theoretical understanding as well as practical applications of vision and language. The techniques developed under this project could similarly be used to connect different types of latent structures across modalities and are not limited to vision and language. This would be extremely beneficial for responsible AI applications in the sciences, where people not only want to understand the relationship in data, but the structure and causal explanations. Such an understanding is also critical for reducing demographic biases that machine learning models exhibit. Through education, open-sourcing and outreach activities, this project will train and educate students of all levels - from K-12 to graduate - in AI, advance theoretical vision and language courses, reduce bias, and further democratize AI.<br/><br/>Preserving structure is an essential component of understanding how to make machine learning models better and more reliable.

An unconventional tomographic plate reconstruction workflow is used that involves 3D mapping of slabs from tomography, slab unfolding (retro-deformation), and assigning plate motions to the unfolded slabs in a hierarchical fashion using available kinematic constraints.  The tomographic plate reconstruction model is systematically compared to relevant circum-Pacific geological datasets, and further tested as input boundary conditions for two distinct geodynamic forward modeling approaches using established workflows for the mature codes CitcomS and TERRA.  The resulting plate model will provide an alternative subduction history for more than half of the Earth that can be simulated within other global models.  In addition, the project explores the capabilities and limitations of seismic tomography for linking the deep mantle to the Earth surface for 4D Earth evolution, which supports an identified key research frontier for NSF Tectonics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The core focus of the project is to determine what rules and practices support the national interest in promoting the progress of computer science while preventing unethical and unjust computer science research. Computing researchers are currently revising ethics codes, writing new ethics guidelines, forming new ethics committees within conferences and professional associations, dictating ethics requirements for funding, and proposing new ethics requirements for publications. This project characterizes and evaluates historical, ongoing, and emerging ethics governance projects within computer science. By creating a recent history of computing governance during this active period of questioning, the project will appraise and evaluate current efforts, and recommend best practices for computing research governance. The results of this project will serve to advance several scientific fields including science and technology studies, research ethics, and computer science. They will also be used in discussions with stakeholder communities including activists in computing ethics, in creating classroom materials for educators, and in developing accessible and brief white papers that are to be disseminated to funders, practitioners, and policymakers.<br/><br/>To accomplish the goals indicated above, this project uses qualitative case studies to compare, evaluate, and interpret the resources, mechanisms, and outcomes of current cross-cutting efforts in computer science research ethics self-governance. The case studies will examine the workings of the computing research?s ethics governance projects to facilitate better understanding of the possibilities and challenges of a field undertaking diverse and multiple ethics governance efforts. Building on previous science and technology studies scholarship, our research reveals the relations enrolling researchers in cultures of ethical practice. To identify a typology of enrollment and enforcement practices, the team will undertake analysis of the resources each project has, and the approach that each project uses to repair past harms, anticipate the future, resolve insecurities about what counts as ethical behavior, and settle controversies within the field. Through analysis of historical and current ethics governance projects, the team will discover how project organization shapes the scope, goals, and outcomes of ethics governance projects; how different mechanisms for effecting adherence to ethical guidelines impact outcomes; how contrasting stakeholders (participants, outside advocates, practitioners) assess the success of ethics governance projects; and the challenges and opportunities different ethics governance projects generate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, many young adults without postsecondary degrees spin their wheels between low-wage jobs. This project examines factors less reliant on formal education that may facilitate or counteract changes in job quality among young adults without postsecondary degrees. This project provides insights to workers about personal actions they can take while searching for and adjusting to new jobs to improve job quality. For employers and managers, this project clarifies how job tasks and the work environment can facilitate worker development and reduce turnover costs. Findings further inform the design of programs aiming to support young workers moving into better-quality jobs, including programs serving youth from low-income families. <br/><br/>This project advances knowledge by developing and testing models that explain how individual factors (e.g., socioeconomic mobility beliefs), family background (e.g., social class origin), and work and nonwork environmental factors (e.g., workplace practices and government programs) drive changes in job quality. The project team is collaborating with the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development and the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development to collect data and analyze administrative records. The project team is surveying workers aged 18-29 without postsecondary degrees and unemployed at the beginning of the study. Additional rounds of surveys are being fielded as participants search for and adjust to new job(s) over the course of one year. Survey responses are being paired with administrative records. This project extends understanding of the role of behavioral processes during job transitions in intra-generational socioeconomic mobility. This project also contributes to knowledge about the interplay between individual agency and contextual factors shaped by family, work organizations, and government agencies during transitions into early adulthood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, batteries are bulky, expensive, high-maintenance, and not sustainable for the next trillion devices. Instead of relying on energy stored in a battery, an emerging class of computing devices harvests all energy needed for operation from sources such as the sun, motion, radio waves, and vibration. However, building sophisticated applications on these battery-free systems is challenging due to frequent power failures from fluctuations in energy harvesting. Programmers must figure out how to string together fragments of execution to meet application goals while dealing with novel software and hardware bugs that stem from power failures. Because of this, memory-intensive, inference-heavy, and user-facing applications have rarely materialized on battery-free devices. New general-purpose hardware platforms with accelerators and heterogeneous computing modules are needed to build these applications. However, hardware is not enough. With new hardware comes new challenges like scalability, dynamism, and memory-efficient checkpointing. This project explores intermittent computing systems and toolchain support for integrating diverse computing modules, like FPGAs, Accelerators, and Vector Processors, alongside traditional microcontrollers. The project weaves scalability across the intermittent computing system stack, leveraging these new modules to enable reactive, adaptive, and high-performance applications on this important new class of computing devices. This project will explore and prototype scalable hardware platforms, adaptive software systems, high-level programming languages, and energy introspection tools that enable even novice developers to quickly prototype sophisticated battery-free applications, despite power failures. These advancements will be demonstrated and evaluated in the context of real-world deployments in mobile health, habitat monitoring, and interactive devices.<br/><br/>Battery-free embedded systems offer a transformative and ecologically sustainable approach for building the next trillion computing devices. This project fills a gap for system designers who lack the hardware platforms, efficient runtime systems, and focused tools to build capable, data-intensive, reactive, and reliable applications with these devices. The results of this research will impact fields across scientific and industrial interests: including healthcare (wearable and body sensor networks), ecology, horticulture, infrastructure, conservation, and public utility monitoring, and many other areas where long-term, massive scale sensing is essential. The hardware, systems, and tools will speed up research and commercialization in critical sectors like smart cities and the Internet of Things. The project's demonstration applications, including smart health devices, interactive devices, and novice-focused programming environments, will provide proof of approach to encourage uptake of battery-free devices. The project includes outreach and education initiatives focused on increasing participation among Native Hawaiian youth in computing by introducing computing concepts via building sustainable and conservation-focused embedded systems applications in partnership with a Native Hawaiian serving public school and non-profit organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the region?s importance for understanding climate change and human evolution, there is a lack of understanding of tropical Africa over long intervals. To that end, the investigators will generate new West African records of rain, vegetation, and fire over the last 25 million years to study changes in the Sahel ecosystem, which runs east-west across Africa south of the Sahara desert, and to quantify the effects of natural cycles in Earth?s orbit and long-term changes in global and regional conditions on ecosystem change and human evolution. The investigators will convene a new African Climate Conference to facilitate knowledge sharing, networking events, and laboratory tours at Lamont to directly combat the long history of the exclusion of African researchers in Western science by forming deep, lasting collaborations.<br/><br/>The Tropics comprise half of Earth?s surface, serve as the global hydrological pump, and contain the world?s largest potential source of methane, yet there is a dearth of data and understanding of tropical climate over the Cenozoic. Tropical Africa, in particular, has been historically under-studied, despite its importance for understanding human evolution, tropical hydroclimate, and terrestrial ecosystem responses to climate change. Projections of future climate scenarios require quantification of past climatic responses to orbital forcings and boundary conditions (i.e., regional albedo, ice volume, global temperature). The investigators will generate new long-term and high-resolution precipitation, vegetation, and fire reconstructions using biomarkers preserved in a marine sediment core that capture the last 25 million years of tropical West African climate. Statistical and time series analyses will evaluate the amplitudes, periodicities, means, and relationships between hydroclimate, ecosystem, and fire proxies through time to decipher the differences in the amplitude of variability in the study windows to characterize sensitivity in the context of various boundary conditions.

Access to high-quality public-use data is critical for many research disciplines. However, analyses of fine-scale geographic regions with small population sizes (e.g., census tracts) often yield statistically unreliable inference.  Small areas also may contain few study participants, thus increasing the risk of disclosure of sensitive information about a participant, such as an individual's disease or employment status.  This project will create a unifying framework between the formal privacy literature and the spatial statistics literature that gives equal weight to privacy considerations and the utility of the resulting data. The results of this research will be of value both to academic researchers and staff at the Federal statistical agencies. The investigator will collaborate with researchers at the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics. Workshops and short courses will be developed by the investigator on spatial statistics and data privacy for staff at the Federal statistical agencies. The project also will create undergraduate research opportunities in Bayesian inference and statistical computing and provide educational opportunities related to spatial statistics and data privacy.<br/><br/>This project will develop Bayesian statistical methods for generating spatially referenced synthetic data that achieve or exceed the privacy protections currently implemented by U.S. Federal statistical agencies.  Small area estimation methods from the spatial statistics literature provide a framework to leverage complex dependencies in the data to improve the precision of an estimate.  Emerging methods from the data privacy literature may be used to mask or otherwise conceal information from these areas to protect the privacy guarantees made to the data subjects in exchange for their participation.  Taken together, these two approaches present an analytic tension between providing accurate and reliable local estimates and the need to obscure detailed linkage between small area estimates and the data subjects residing therein. This project will tackle the following issues.  First, the project will devise a statistical framework for producing massive, differentially private public-use data repositories comprised of spatially referenced synthetic aggregate count data.  A key aspect of this work will be to strike a balance between computational efficiency and data utility.  Second, the project will establish criteria for synthetic data from a broad class of spatial models to satisfy formal privacy protections.  The result of this work will be methods that provide substantial gains in utility and help combine the tasks of data analysis and the generation of synthetic data to avoid redundancies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ants provide powerful study systems for exploring these and related topics because they show striking diversity within and between species. A defining feature of ant societies is the presence of a reproductive caste system where some individuals called queens specialize on reproduction and other individuals called workers specialize on other tasks. In most species, workers possess reduced reproductive organs and are capable of reproduction under certain circumstances (e.g., queen death), but in other species, workers completely lack reproductive organs. Such obligate worker sterility has evolved at least 14 times across ants, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of this obligate sterility or whether the mechanisms are the same across each of the independent origins of sterility. The overall goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the expression and evolution of obligate sterility in ants and to further validate the effects of genes influencing the development of sterility in fruit flies. Our research may provide novel insight into conserved genetic pathways regulating animal reproduction and reproductive health. Further broader impacts of the research will be training students and researchers in approaches to study the genetic basis and evolution of development, working to improve public understanding of evolution and development, and working to increase student participation in science.  <br/><br/>A major goal of Biology is to understand the mechanisms linking genomes to phenotypes and how evolution generates and tinkers with these regulatory mechanisms to produce the diversity of life. One striking phenotype is the presence of an obligately sterile worker caste in social insects, which has evolved at least 14 times in ants, yet little is known about the underlying regulatory networks and whether this convergent phenotypic evolution involves convergent or parallel molecular evolution. The overall goal of this research is to use an integrative approach to elucidate the gene regulatory networks underlying the expression and evolution of obligate sterility in ants. Ants provide a rare opportunity to study how infertility and sterility evolved within the context of their societies, connecting individual germline loss to colony-level gain of a sterile worker caste. The germ-soma distinction within organisms is fundamental to multicellular life, and germline sequestration is a fundamentally important step in animal development. This research may contribute to understanding general principles and molecular pathways associated with animal development and the origin of cell types. Moreover, the research may provide novel candidate genes and pathways regulating a range of complex phenotypes associated with reproduction, reproductive health, to be further studied in model organisms.

The proposed work will examine mercury sources, primarily from the atmosphere, and how mercury is finally removed from ocean waters. Specifically, this study is focused on the South Pacific and Southern Ocean around Antarctica, regions that are remote from human activity and their associated Hg inputs to the biosphere. Human activity has substantially enhanced the amount of Hg in the biosphere and its levels in seafood consumed by humans, and therefore their potential exposure, but its impact in these remote regions is poorly constrained. The measurements will be made during two ocean expeditions that form part of the international GEOTRACES program. GEOTRACES aims to examine the concentrations and distributions of trace elements and their isotopes in the atmosphere, surface and deep oceans of the world. Mercury is a primarily a concern because of its ability to bioaccumulate in marine food chains, primarily in its organic form, methylmercury (MeHg). Elevated levels of MeHg in fish and other marine organisms is a concern for human and wildlife health due to exposure through seafood consumption, and the factors controlling this exposure are not well understood. The proposed work will support three graduate and several undergraduate students across the three participating institutions.<br/><br/>During the two expeditions, the research team will collect high resolution data on the concentrations of the primary Hg forms in the atmosphere, the water column, and the sediments, to examine the sources of Hg to these regions and the processes that lead to the conversion of Hg to its more toxic and bioaccumulative form, MeHg. Dissolved and particulate forms of the various Hg species (gaseous elemental Hg, ionic Hg, MeHg and dimethylmercury) will be determined in the atmosphere and throughout the water column using high resolution sampling and novel techniques. Additionally, measurements of Hg stable isotopes in atmospheric and water samples will be used to identify sources (e.g., geogenic or anthropogenic inputs) and delivery mechanisms (e.g., dry or wet deposition, glacial melt) of Hg to these regions. This comprehensive project will leverage Hg speciation and Hg source tracking capabilities to assess the importance of human activity and climate change in altering the amount of Hg and MeHg in these ocean waters, and the resultant levels in marine organisms consumed by humans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Why does ECS remain stubbornly segregated when it comes to gender parity? The goal of this CAREER project is to use ethnography to compare subfields of ECS in which women have different levels of participation. It investigates the relationship between cultural values, norms and practices that 1) presume practitioners from dominant groups are more competent than practitioners from underrepresented groups; and 2) privilege the technical dimensions of computing over the social ones. The uneven participation of women across ECS subfields suggests that subfield cultural values and norms vary. To examine this variation, this project focuses primarily on the experiences of female faculty members because they are a critical population that shape the next generation of ECS practitioners, have a long-standing relationships with their disciplinary subfields, and may have experiences that could lend critical insights into the social/technical divide. The project's findings articulate and forge pathways toward broadening participation in ECS because they inform learning modules and course curricula to educate students, faculty, and leaders in academia about the benefits of diversity and transformations required to foster welcoming environments for women to participate in ECS with equal opportunities, resources and regard. Due to the prominence and impact of ECS, identifying gender inequities in the field and interrupting them will help welcome and retain more talented women from a range of intersectional identities. Harnessing the power of diversity in this way will positively contribute to all domains on which computing impinges.<br/><br/>This CAREER project is a comparative analysis of the impact of subfield culture on women's representation in ECS. It deconstructs theoretical assumptions undergirding ECS practices to understand how complex, intersectional biases disenfranchise women from the field. To yield new knowledge useful in efforts to broaden participation, this CAREER project systematically conceptualizes how labor segregation may relate to an ideological hierarchy between the social and technical dimensions of computing and influence cultural exclusions along intersecting vectors of gender and race. Using a theory-driven, interdisciplinary research approach that integrates gender and racial equity research, anthropology and science and technology studies, this CAREER project works to: 1) Develop and refine a theoretical model of change in ECS to combat the covert and overt mechanisms that marginalize women; 2) Describe and analyze epistemic bias emerging from ideologies that consider empirical data superior to qualitative data and trivialize socially applied research in ECS; 3) Identify and assess elements of culture in ECS that reproduce or challenge inequitable power relations; 4) Describe women's differential experiences in ECS subfields along vectors of race, ethnicity, and gender identity; 5) Develop and analyze educational interventions into ECS culture that spring from an original method integrating ethnography and case study methods to both interrupt the reproduction of dominant class rule and to study the beliefs and power relations of computing communities. Not only does this project contribute a novel qualitative theory of cultural change in ECS, it also tests innovative methods to better elucidate who and what counts in the field and why. Further, it creates highly adaptable and sustainable techniques that provide opportunities for engineers to practice recognizing and responding to bias in social dynamics and articulating means of institutional change in communion with their peers. Finally, this project provides much needed anthropological theory to the problem of women's underrepresentation in ECS to advance inclusive educational practices that support and capitalize on the aptitudes of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
