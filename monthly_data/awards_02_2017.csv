The NGA is a highly productive subarctic biome where intense environmental variability has profound impacts on lower trophic level organisms and community dynamics that, directly or indirectly, support the iconic fish, crabs, seabirds and marine mammals of Alaska. In the NGA, a pronounced spring bloom and regions of sustained summer production support a stable base of energy-rich zooplankton grazers and a substantial sinking flux of organic matter, thereby efficiently transferring primary production up the food chain and contributing to carbon export. The LTER research team will examine features, mechanisms and processes that drive this productivity and system-wide resilience to understand how short- and long-term climate variability propagates through the environment to influence organisms. This highly productive biome will provide a valuable new component to the LTER network by investigating marine ecosystem changes in a region impacted by warming surface ocean trends, and by leveraging a strong climate context provided by two decades of prior observations and a rich history of coupled biological-physical modeling to advance prediction of ecosystem response to perturbation. To complement the observational and modeling efforts, the NGA LTER includes an Education & Outreach component that will develop videos highlighting the understanding gained from this research, and the activities of scientists in ocean-related STEM careers. These products will be presented to the public through various high-traffic venues, will be incorporated into virtual field trips for K-12 students, and will be available to the LTER network. The NGA LTER program will also serve as a platform to train graduate and undergraduate students across disciplines and in cutting-edge field and data-analysis techniques. Finally, synthetic activities will aid in effective ecosystem-based management of commercially important fisheries in Alaska.<br/><br/>The research focus of the NGA LTER site will be on mechanistic understanding of processes that underlie environmental variability, and the role of the latter in promoting high productivity and resilience. Building on prior knowledge, the investigators will test three hypotheses centered on ecosystem emergent properties: 1. Changes in the hydrologic cycle affect spring bloom production through changes in cloud cover, the stratification/mixing balance, macro- and micronutrient supplies, and transport pathways. 2. Hot-spots of high summer primary and secondary production result from interactions between the fresher Alaska Coastal Current and more saline offshore waters as promoted by shelf morphology and regional winds; hot spot timing and magnitude will be influenced by changes in the hydrologic cycle. 3. Nutritional and life history patterns of NGA consumers minimize trophic mismatch, buffering spatial and temporal variability in lower trophic level production and leading to resilience in the face of long-term climate change.  The investigators will address these hypotheses with an integrated research program that includes: a) seasonal time series studies addressing short- and long-term environmental and ecosystem variability through a spring-to-fall field cruise- and mooring-based observational program, building upon and enhancing the Seward Line times series, and leveraging existing collaborations to obtain higher trophic level data; b) process studies that focus on hypothesized mechanisms leading to variability and enhancement of NGA production in time and space; c) modeling studies that incorporate physical and biogeochemical observations, provide a framework for testing hypotheses, and predict ecosystem responses to projected environmental changes; d) a data management component that provides a public platform for data visualization and synthesis by LTER colleagues, educators & students, and resource managers."

A finite resource, blood relies on volunteer donors and successful public outreach campaigns. Blood services must also ensure the safety of the supply, namely monitoring the donation process to prevent the transmission of blood borne infections (including HIV) and mitigating adverse health effects on patients and donors. Focusing on the concerns of sustainability and safety, this project will examine various practical and social aspects of blood supply, ranging from donor marketing and recruitment to the implementation of donor management information systems, as well as the efficient hospital use of blood. Findings from this project, which trains a graduate student in methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, will be disseminated to organizations that manage and develop policy related to blood safety practices. The research also fosters international scientific cooperation, and will broaden participation of an underrepresented group in the sciences.<br/><br/>Emily Avera, under the supervision of Dr. Sherine Hamdy of Brown University, will explore what factors are prioritized in the maintenance of safety in blood banks. The project will take place primarily in South Africa, where the blood services have established one of the most stringent and effective blood safety systems in the world. Blood safety officials' are concerned with diversity and sustainability. They advocate for increased donor participation from a more diverse cross-section of the populace (e.g. youth, various ethnicities), as matter of sustainability not only for social representation, but to also leverage the statistical correlation of different blood types with certain populations. Equipped with anthropology training, the researcher is well positioned to address the pertinent cultural and symbolic meanings attached to blood, alongside the social issues related to health equity and safety. In addition to an incredibly diverse population, South African blood services must also reckon with chief societal challenges such as high HIV prevalence and equitable resource distribution. To analyze how South African institutions have dealt with these challenges, the researcher will conduct regular long-term observation and data collection of activities in blood services' offices, donor outreach drives, blood safety NGO's, and a public hospital hematology unit, as well as interviews with organizational staff, patients, and donors. The researcher will also analyze relevant educational materials and media to assess linguistic and cultural aspects of developing effective, scientifically sound public communication about blood safety and donation. The findings of this project will directly contribute to evaluating and improving donor outreach and education, safety measures, blood service information management, and efficient and equitable distribution of the blood supply not only in South Africa, but in a majority of countries - including the U.S. - where transfusion medicine is used."

Oregon Number Theory Days are targeted primarily at regional graduate students, postdocs, and faculty in number theory located in the Willamette Valley area in the state of Oregon. Each of the host institutions operates on a schedule of three terms per year, and the goal is to hold three seminars per year, one seminar per term, over the course of three years. The speakers will be distinguished researchers in number theory, or related fields of direct interest to number theorists, who are also known to be exceptional expositors. They represent an internationally diverse group of mathematicians, speaking on a wide variety of topics, including topics that are complementary to those already studied by local number theorists in Oregon. In particular, without this seminar series, these topics are harder to access by mathematicians in Oregon. Local postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students will also be invited to speak and present their most recent research in an encouraging environment. <br/><br/>Oregon is home to a growing community of researchers and students in number theory, but it is a low-population state which is geographically isolated from the traditional major centers of activity. This poses a significant financial challenge to students and postdoctoral faculty members for travel to conferences and workshops. Oregon Number Theory Days will feature presentations by high-profile international number theory experts on current research topics, which will be of great benefit to students, postdocs, and faculty residing in Oregon. In addition, it will help build a strong sense of community among the number theory researchers within the Willamette Valley area. This seminar series will host a diverse group of participants and speakers. The organizers of Oregon Number Theory Days believe that providing a broad representation of distinguished mathematicians is an important factor in the recruitment and development of underrepresented groups in academia. Oregon Number Theory Days will welcome every interested participant, and will particularly encourage graduate students to participate. This award will primarily be used to support the traveling expenses of local graduate and postdoctoral fellows to the hosting institutions."

Web apps and software marketplaces have made it easier than ever before to distribute software to anyone and anywhere. However, writing good smartphone apps remains challenging. Developers must anticipate and adapt to numerous different devices and users, and to the changing conditions and environments caused by mobility. One minute the network is fast and free, the next it is slow and metered. The importance of adaptation to successful mobile apps is well understood. However, little language and system support exists to help developers create and improve adaptive mobile apps.<br/>This project investigates a new system enabling the next generation of adaptive apps. Central to the approach is a new language construct that allows developers to express flexibility within their source code. This allows decisions that today must be made during development to be deferred, and leaves flexibility that can be harnessed to enable adaptation. Intelligently utilizing flexibility exposed by developers requires novel approaches to automated pre-deployment testing and dynamic adaptation policy generation. The project also explores how to guide developers toward useful flexibility, and how flexibility should be managed and exposed in current and next-generation programming languages.<br/><br/>The integrated educational plan also explores how to harness flexibility, but uses it to adapt online courses to make them more effective. Beginning with a concept library containing overlapping and self-reinforcing lessons, the project explores two forms of flexibility. Lessons can be reordered to express different prerequisites, and within each lesson multiple explanations an be used for different students. Integrated quiz results and other forms f feedback will be used to determine the success or failure of different approaches. These new personalized learning techniques will be applied to an existing online course on the internet created by the investigator."

Indeed, the recent DARPA Robotics Challenge dramatically demonstrated that some of the world's most advanced robots still minimize contact with their environments and fail often in realistic operating scenarios. This creates a significant barrier to unleashing robots into critical disaster response, exploration, and industrial applications. Algorithms that explicitly reason about robustness require a coupling of motion planning and feedback design, in which the system's closed-loop response to disturbance sources is optimized. Due to the often heavy computational demands of solving such problems, their application to modern field robots has so far been limited.<br/><br/>The research objective of this proposal is to address the theoretical, computational, and applied challenges of robust motion planning for robots with nonlinear dynamics and state and input constraints, including constraints arising from frictional contact. The algorithms under consideration in this research will build on direct trajectory optimization methods to simultaneously 1) support complex state constraints and rigid-body contacts and 2) exploit mathematical structure in disturbance and feedback controller sets to construct computationally-efficient algorithms. The ability of these algorithms to improve stability in tasks of broad interest, such as bipedal walking, will be investigated. Algorithms will be evaluated against state-of-the-art methods in locomotion and manipulation experiments on physical robots."

The inherent nature of polymer molecules, consisting of very long molecular chains, leads to a highly complex hierarchy of structures in the solid state.  The ability to control these hierarchical structures significantly influences mechanical and thermal properties of the resulting materials. Thus, semicrystalline polymers are used in a wide variety of applications including packaging, textiles, automobile, airplane parts, energy, biocompatible materials, and others. To further improve properties of semicrystalline polymers, it is necessary to understand their detailed structures in the solid state as well as the mechanisms of structural formation at the molecular level. This project focuses on fundamental understanding of molecular-level structures of semicrystalline polymers in samples crystallized in various controlled ways, and may lead to predictions of improved properties for commercially available polymeric materials. The PI will use novel magnetic resonance techniques to probe the molecular trajectory of polymer chains in the solid state of such polymer materials.  This information will provide unprecedented detail about the molecular morphology of polymers and the interconnections among crystals, and would have implications on their mechanical properties.  This project will also include advanced scientific training of graduate students in technologically important areas. They will experience a wide range of polymer research covering polymer synthesis, crystallization, advanced instrumentation, and molecular dynamics simulations. The research results will be reported in scientific journals and presented by the PI and students at national scientific meetings.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  <br/><br/>Polymer crystallization induces structural changes of polymer molecules from random coils to folded chains in thin crystals. The mechanism of crystallization has been theoretically and experimentally studied in many publications over the past several decades. However, no decisive conclusion has been reached regarding the crystallization mechanism and chain-level structure.  The PI has developed advanced techniques for 13C-13C double quantum (DQ) NMR combined with selective isotopic 13C labeling.  Using these together with spin-dynamics simulation enables determination of the re-entrance sites of folded chains, the adjacent re-entry fraction, the successive folding number of semicrystalline polymers in the bulk and in solution-grown single crystals as a function of crystallization temperature.  These experiments shed light on the extent of adjacent re-entry of polymer chains in solution-grown and bulk materials, the formation of three-dimensional nanostructures, and the effect of crystallization kinetics on the extent of chain folding.  These aspects can be correlated with bundle and aggregation models and recent molecular dynamics simulation results. The planned experiments will further investigate the effects on chain trajectory in crystalline regions for a variety of important parameters including i) molecular weight, ii) polymer concentration, iii) solvent-polymer interactions, iv) confined spaces, v) entanglements, and vi) melt-memory. Such studies will provide detailed crystallization mechanisms of flexible semicrystalline polymers while contributing to the advanced training of students in technologically important areas."

In these waters -- as in coastal waters around the globe -- human activities, environmental variability, and decadal-scale change intersect to have diverse effects on the planktonic food web. It is crucial to understand the structure of this web, how it functions, and how it responds to seasonal environmental change, in order to respond appropriately to long-term trends that are accelerating in this region. Our understanding, however, has been limited by a lack of systematic and detailed measurements over a sufficient length of time so that we can observe the responses of these webs to environmental perturbations and uncover the underlying causes and implications. The Northeast US Shelf (NES) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project will provide such observations, analyze them with a variety of models, and improve our ability to predict how planktonic food webs change through space and time, and how those changes impact the productivity of higher trophic levels including commercially important fish. In addition, the NES-LTER project will have multifaceted broader impacts, including collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA), Northeast Fisheries Science Center to support multispecies, ecosystem-based management on the NES. The project includes an education plan that will provide opportunities to a broad range of learners and a far-reaching public outreach component will be developed through NOAA's international Science-On-a-Sphere network. <br/><br/>While patterns of ecosystem change over seasons to decades have already been documented in this region, the key mechanisms linking changes in the physical environment, planktonic food webs, and higher trophic levels remain poorly understood. For this reason, predictive capability is limited and management strategies are largely reactive. To address these needs, the NES-LTER strategy combines observations that provide regional-scale context, process cruises along a high gradient cross-shelf transect, high-frequency time series at inner- and outer-shelf locations, coupled biological-physical food web models, and targeted population models. The research plan is guided by an overarching science question: How is long-term environmental change impacting the pelagic NES ecosystem and, in particular, affecting the relationship between compositional (e.g., species diversity and size structure) and aggregate (e.g., rates of primary production, and transfer of energy to important forage fish species) variability? By capitalizing on high levels of seasonal and interannual variability in the NES, the research will study short-term responses to change in the environment to a) characterize low and high export food webs, b) understand the linkages and transfer of energy from the phytoplankton to pelagic fish, and c) identify the mechanisms that underlie shifts between high and low export communities. Ultimately, mechanistic knowledge will be scaled up to understand and predict the impacts and feedbacks associated with trends in decadal-scale forcing in the ecosystem."

In addition, results from this study may help wheat breeders develop wheat cultivars to enhance the production of the agriculture industry and benefit the rural community in the U.S. Therefore, this study may have a major impact on society since wheat is an important food crop in the US and the world and the Hessian fly is one of the most destructive pests of wheat in North America and North Africa. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed study is to reveal the molecular mechanism of heat-induced loss of plant resistance using wheat-Hessian fly interaction as a model. The specific objectives of the proposed research are to: 1) determine the impact of heat stress on interactions between different wheat resistance genes (R genes) and Hessian fly biotypes; 2) examine heat-induced genome-wide changes in gene expression in wheat using high throughput molecular technologies, and 3) identify genes and pathways that possibly contribute to the heat-induced loss of wheat resistance. The findings from the research will enhance understanding of the molecular mechanism of the heat-induced loss of resistance in plants and co-evolution between host plants and parasites. This project will be conducted in collaboration with faculty from North Carolina State University."

The basic arithmetic problems in question are finding, counting, and understanding the distribution of integer (or rational) solutions to algebraic equations that arise naturally in mathematics. The simplicity and intrinsic beauty of these problems, and the disproportionate depth and effort of their resolution, has inspired their study since ancient Greece. In many cases, the symmetries of the algebraic equations in question have a rich geometric and analytic structure. Using this structure it is possible to translate the arithmetic problems into geometric and dynamic problems on spaces of symmetries. Understanding how the arithmetic features of a problem manifest in the geometry of the corresponding space creates a link between arithmetic and geometric phenomena, and advances knowledge in both fields. The research in this proposal is complemented by educational and outreach activities, including the creation of a summer research workshop and a graduate seminar on analytic number theory.<br/><br/>The PI will study two types of problems in homogenous dynamics, both originating  from arithmetic. The first type of problems are shrinking target problems for unipotent flows on homogenous spaces. Shrinking target problems for diagonalizable group actions on homogenous spaces are very well understood. The corresponding problems for unipotent flows (as well as other slow mixing actions) are not yet understood, except for some special arithmetic cases. The PI will use methods from spectral theory and analytic number theory, in combination with methods of homogenous dynamics and ergodic theory, in order to analyze shrinking target problems for unipotent flows and their applications to the classical field of metric Diophantine approximations.  The second type of problems regards the distribution of translates of closed orbits on homogenous spaces. The study of the distribution of translates of closed subgroup-orbits is an interesting problem with many applications. When the orbits are compact, or of finite measure, there are a number of techniques to study the limiting distribution of their translates, and these can be applied to study the classical problem of distribution of integer points in algebraic varieties; they are also amenable to more analytic applications in the study of L-functions of automorphic forms. The PI will extend such results to orbits of infinite measure, with an emphasis on cases having interesting arithmetic applications."

Using machine learning and natural language processing methods, it is possible to estimate public opinion, consumer sentiment, and population health based on what people are publicly sharing about their thoughts and actions online.  For example, if someone writes that they have a fever, we might infer that they have the flu; if we aggregate all messages like this, we can track the prevalence and spread of the flu at a population level.  However, a challenge with applying machine learning to user-generated content is that the characteristics of the content are highly dependent on the Who, When, and Where of the users.  Online discussions evolve rapidly; a system built in one year might not work well in the next, and a system built for one community of users might not work for another.  The proposed project seeks to create machine learning methods that are robust to variations in time, geography, and demographics of content and content creators.  Related to domain adaptation techniques in machine learning, the PI proposes methods that learn to generalize across these various content attributes.  The general goal is to create robust, open source tools that can be easily adopted by other researchers.  One particular outcome of the project will be to improve the machine learning classifiers used in prior work on social media-based disease surveillance.  The output of the PI's health analysis systems will be integrated into HealthTweets.org, a publicly accessible website that shares daily estimates of disease prevalence for other researchers and health officials. <br/><br/><br/>The project will create hierarchical Bayesian models for training classifiers that can be adapted across different content attributes.  The specific attributes of interest include time, geography, and demographic group of the author, but the proposed models do not depend on the specific attributes, and can be broadly applied to other machine learning settings.  As a starting point, a predictive model (classification or regression) will be constructed that can be adapted across one attribute at a time.  The PI will then create novel extensions to the model that can adapt across conjunctions of multiple attributes, such as time AND location.  These extensions are related to the PI's prior work on building structured topic models that learn relationships between different features of content.  Finally, in addition to creating predictive models, the PI will also build models of content that can be used to infer missing attributes (e.g., the location of a user if it is unknown), which can be combined with the predictive models to jointly perform inference and classification. Classification performance in new settings on a variety of datasets and exploration of the effects of, and sensitivity to, different parameters will be tested.  Specific deliverables include the improvement a classifier for detecting influenza infection on Twitter, and integrating the classifier into the website, HealthTweets.org."

Computation due to chemical reactions is prevalent in biology - for example, every cell in our body must perform sophisticated information processing on internal and external chemical signals. Analogously, it is important to learn how to rationally engineer biochemical pathways that are capable of decision-making. Unlike silicon chips, molecular computers could operate inside cells and control their activity. Programmable chemical reactions could be useful for a range of applications in manufacturing, chemical sensing, and medicine. For example, ""smart drugs"" that target drug activity to disease cells and activate in response to specific molecular clues would have minimal side effects and improve therapeutic outcomes. This proposal addresses a key algorithmic challenge in chemical information processing: how to compute robustly despite the disordered and error-prone nature of the chemical environment. Mathematical models (chemical reaction networks) provide the clarity of thought to explicate universal principles of proofreading chemical algorithms, while a laboratory realization (using engineered DNA molecules) provides the necessary grounding. The success of this proposal will lead not only to new theoretical understanding but to a new generation of functional molecular devices. Specifically, this proposal will address a long-standing challenge in medical diagnostics: enzyme-free sequence-specific detection of DNA. Enzyme-free systems have the potential to be adapted to ""in-the-field"" operation, where sophisticated laboratory equipment is out of reach. The research program proposed is tightly coupled to educational and outreach activities. This proposal will fund the development of college courses and instructional material, which will train students in applying the proven principles of computer science and electrical engineering to the new domain of molecular computation. The primary educational goal is to encourage the next generation of scientists to break through traditional disciplinary barriers and create the scientific and engineering fields of tomorrow. Further, the project will contribute to early STEM education through gamification.<br/><br/>The proposed work uses the formal model of chemical reaction networks to rigorously explore the principles of robust chemical computation. Chemical reaction networks formalize the computation that results from molecules interacting in a well-mixed solution obeying chemical kinetics. The work described could yield chemical algorithms for decreasing error exponentially as more molecules are involved in the computation, as well as for fast and entirely error-free computation of simple functions. Additionally, the impossibility results obtained, such as the fundamental tradeoffs between computational power and robustness, will help avoid pursuing untenable goals. Complementary to deriving general laws for the computational power of chemical kinetics, another thrust of this proposal addresses the problem of leak (spurious reactions) for a commonly used molecular primitive from DNA nanotechnology (strand displacement reactions). Leak makes it difficult to distinguish positive signal and background, which results in reduced sensitivity, as well as significantly decreased computation speed. This proposal outlines the first principled approach to proofreading in strand displacement systems that could achieve arbitrarily low levels of leak."

Graph models have been ubiquitously employed in scientific applications (e.g., computational molecular biology and ecology) and industrial applications (e.g., world wide web and social network services). With advanced computing techniques, real-world applications can generate graph datasets of unprecedented scales, such as a worldwide social network, where a large graph can contain billions or trillions of vertices (identities) and edges (relationships). Graph visualization, creating visual or diagrammatic representations of graphs, has been commonly used as an effective means to facilitate users to gain meaningful overviews of graph structures and capture regions of interest. However, there is still a lack of scalable visualization solutions that are efficient and practical for very large graph datasets and allow users to explore and discover possible insights in a timely manner. Such solutions can only be obtained with a holistic coordination of processing, organization, and visualization of large graphs, which however has not been fully investigated in most of the previous graph visualization work. This project seeks techniques to ensure the scalability and the usability of large graph visualization by tackling an end-to-end graph visualization pipeline including graph processing, organization, and visualization. Since graphs exist in many scientific and industrial applications as a critical data model, through the outreach activities and the collaboration with domain experts, graph visualization tools and optimization techniques developed in this research can greatly benefit a broader class of fields and communities. The education objective of this project is to leverage real-world large graph visualization to effectively promote students' engagement and learning efficiency in science and engineering studies. In particular, the project aims to leverage interdisciplinary synergies to develop and renovate undergraduate and graduate courses to facilitate the learning of both major and non-major students.  Interdisciplinary graph applications will be used to enhance outreach, student recruitment, and research opportunities. Teaching effectiveness will be assessed with an involvement of educators from different disciplines.<br/><br/>The project will develop scalable visualization techniques for very large graphs by exploiting graph structure properties and computer systems optimization. To accomplish this goal, the project has the following objectives. First, scalable parallel clustering methods will be developed to extract sub-graphs with dense intra-connections from large graphs. Second, new algorithms will be designed to address the fundamental data locality problem by identifying and organizing sub-graphs according to their potential access patterns in support of graph processing and visualization. Third, structure-aware visualization techniques, adopting a hierarchical manner, will be developed to provide users an efficient and effective visual guide for large graph exploration. These results will transform conventional visualization methods, which were not ready for handling graphs with billions or trillions of vertices and edges, to efficient and practical techniques for real-world large-scale graph applications. The research and education results from this project will be disseminated in premier conferences and journals and other forms.

They are increasingly used for applications ranging from drug delivery to membranes for sensing or batteries.  Membranes of polyelectrolytes for these applications can be built up, layer by layer, by sequentially dipping a surface into a negatively charged polyelectrolyte followed by dipping into a positively charged one.  Additionally, gels swollen with water, known as ""coacervates"", can be made by mixing two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes.  Despite the importance of these materials in biology and advanced applications, their behavior is poorly known, and neither the properties of coacervates nor the rate of growth of layer-by-layer membranes is understood at present. While promising theories for such polyelectrolyte materials have recently been developed, there is little systematic experimental data to test and confirm these theories so as to help design advanced materials.  To provide such tests, this project will use both simple and advanced experimental methods to measure the composition of coacervates, and the growth rate and thickness of layer-by-layer films.  These measurements will be carried out systematically with varying salt concentration and pH to establish quantitative trends needed to test and confirm newly developed theory and provide a firm base for design of advanced materials made from polyelectrolytes.  Such knowledge is also relevant in biological systems, including the interactions of positively charged proteins with negatively charged DNA, which controls the structure and function of chromosomes.  Beyond the research, broader impacts of this project will include the education of graduate and undergraduate students, outreach, and development of specialized computational codes relevant to this topic.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>To understand and test theories for the equilibrium and dynamics of assemblies of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, several phases of study will be performed. First, the phase behavior including compositions of individual polyions in both coacervate and supernatant phases for four common polyelectrolyte mixtures will be measured by high pressure liquid chromatography, proton NMR, and other methods. The results will be compared to the predictions of new theories, and used to test and improve these theories. Titrations with acid and base will be used to determine ion pairing equilibrium constants, ionization equilibrium, and thermodynamic ""chi"" parameters. In addition, Layer-by-Layer (LbL) growth rates for these polyelectrolytes will be measured and the thermodynamic information determined by theory and phase behavior will be used to predict these growth rates.  The diffusivities of polyions through the polyelectrolyte multilayer needed for predictions of LbL growth will be inferred from strengths of ion pairing obtained from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a polyanion and polycation in water and salt."

The goal of this NSF CAREER award project is to develop safer and more beneficial structured prediction methods. Anticipated improvements have the potential for broader impact in application areas with critical performance measures, such as healthcare and autonomous vehicle safety.

They represent an internationally diverse group of mathematicians, speaking on a wide variety of topics, including topics that are complementary to those already studied by local number theorists in Oregon. In particular, without this seminar series, these topics are harder to access by mathematicians in Oregon. Local postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students will also be invited to speak and present their most recent research in an encouraging environment. <br/><br/>Oregon is home to a growing community of researchers and students in number theory, but it is a low-population state which is geographically isolated from the traditional major centers of activity. This poses a significant financial challenge to students and postdoctoral faculty members for travel to conferences and workshops. Oregon Number Theory Days will feature presentations by high-profile international number theory experts on current research topics, which will be of great benefit to students, postdocs, and faculty residing in Oregon. In addition, it will help build a strong sense of community among the number theory researchers within the Willamette Valley area. This seminar series will host a diverse group of participants and speakers. The organizers of Oregon Number Theory Days believe that providing a broad representation of distinguished mathematicians is an important factor in the recruitment and development of underrepresented groups in academia. Oregon Number Theory Days will welcome every interested participant, and will particularly encourage graduate students to participate.

Members of the Agaricomycotina have profound impacts on the functioning of ecosystems through their activities as decayers, pathogens, and beneficial symbionts. Researchers who study members of the Agaricomycotina include medical mycologists, plant pathologists, biofuels researchers, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists. However, such activities are often hampered by the lack of a coherent evolutionary and taxonomic framework for Agaricomycotina. In addition to professional scientists, many members of the public are interested in mushrooms, which they may collect for food, dyes, or as art objects. Amateur mycologists use field guides that are organized according to the physical forms of the mushrooms (e.g., gilled mushroom, polypores, coral fungi, etc.), but these often do not reflect evolutionary relationships. Consequently, amateur mycologists fail to appreciate the genealogical groupings of Agaricomycotina, or the rationale for taxonomic name changes when they occur. In this project,  25 years of work on the Agaricomycotina will be synthesized to produce two books on the subject. One will be a technical publication on ""Systematics of Agaricomycotina"" for professional scientists and graduate students. ""Systematics of Agaricomycotina"" will enable scientists from diverse backgrounds to gain an overview of the diversity and evolutionary relationships of mushroom-forming fungi, and promote comparative perspectives in basic and applied fungal science. The other book will be a popular text, titled ""Mushrooms in the Tree of Life"" for amateur mycologists. ""Mushrooms in the Tree of Life"" will show how evolutionary trees are estimated and help amateur mycologists make connections between field guides and the technical literature in fungal systematics.<br/><br/>This work will result in a comprehensive scientific summary text and a popular text for the public.  The first, entitled ""Systematics of Agaricomycotina"", will include five chapters on general topics, including (1) History of phylogenetics of Agaricomycotina; (2) Overview of phylogeny and diversity of Agaricomycotina; (3) Character bases of systematics of Agaricomycotina; (4) Morphological and developmental evolution in Agaricomycotina; and (5) Ecological diversity and evolution of nutritional modes in Agaricomycotina; as well as eleven chapters (6-16) describing individual groups of Agaricomycotina. The popular text, ""Mushrooms in the Tree of Life,"" will be organized in three parts: (1) ""Reconstructing the tree of life"", which will contain a concise primer of fungal phylogenetics, with minimal jargon; (2) ""Mushrooms in the tree of life"", which will present a higher-level phylogenetic framework for mushroom-forming fungi, emphasizing groups that are familiar to amateur mycologists; and (3) ""Stories from the tree of life"", which will contain a series of evolutionary vignettes about mushrooms, illustrating historical narratives that can only be addressed with a phylogenetic perspective."

With existing P&O devices, mobility is often limited by stairs, slopes, and uneven terrains. State-of-the-art powered P&O devices are capable of overcoming these obstacles, but most current advanced control methods are specialized to a limited set of specific pre-defined motions -- for example, walking, running, and ascending or descending stairs. Existing approaches must infer the user's intention and switch to the most closely matching pre-defined activity. Even if user intention is correctly interpreted, the desired motion may not match any of the pre-determined options. In contrast, the P&O devices enabled by this project will provide mobility for a continuously changing variety of tasks, including the ability to respond to changing and unanticipated slope and footing conditions. In addition to restoring natural function, the investigated control approach can also adjust the physical environment as experienced by the user. For example, the apparent weight and mass of the user could be reduced to provide increased stability during physical therapy, or even to enhance natural capabilities. This work will significantly improve quality of life and productivity for nearly a million lower-limb amputees, and even more stroke survivors, in the US alone. The integrated education plan will have broad impact by 1) promoting disability awareness and increasing interest in STEM among K-12 and college students, 2) fostering mutual understanding between engineering and P&O students through joint education and research, and 3) educating P&O students in STEM concepts that will be needed to utilize the projected P&O technologies in their future clinical practice.<br/><br/>This project supports a paradigm shift from task-specific, kinematic control approaches to task-invariant, energetic control approaches for powered P&O devices that can assist lower-limb amputees and stroke survivors across varying activities. This project will advance knowledge in the control of powered P&O devices through energy shaping, where the parameters and/or formula for the human body's energy are altered in closed loop to achieve more desirable dynamics. In this approach, wearable actuators could reduce mass/inertia parameters in body energetics to dynamically offload the weight of a stroke patient who otherwise would be supported by multiple therapists during gait rehabilitation. Powered prosthetic legs could provide support and propulsion during amputee locomotion by shaping the momentum of the human body. Accordingly, the goals of this project are to 1) understand how to use wearable actuators to shape the energetics of the human body during locomotion, 2) determine specific changes to body energetics that lead to effective control strategies for powered prosthetic legs and powered leg orthoses (i.e., exoskeletons), and 3) understand how different gaits (i.e., kinematic patterns) emerge from body energetics in order to design task-invariant controllers for powered P&O devices. This innovation in dynamics and control will enable P&O devices to assist humans in a continuum of locomotor activities, which cannot be achieved with state-of-art control strategies based on pre-defined, task-specific joint kinematics."

For ultrasound imaging, the contrast agents are micron-sized bubbles, which oscillate in size when they are exposed to ultrasound. The image enhancement provided by the microbubbles depends on their detailed dynamics and their responses to the specific waveform of the ultrasound. Microbubbles are also used for medical therapies, such as carriers for intravenous drug delivery and as agents for ultrasonic ablation of tissue. This CAREER award will provide support to develop models and algorithms for determining the driving ultrasound waveforms that optimize desired responses of lipid-coated microbubbles for imaging and other therapies. The project will comprise mathematical modeling and numerical computations validated by experiments. The project will also support educational activities for K-12 students. Educational modules related to biotechnology will be developed for students participating in STEM summer camps at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. In addition, an online educational game, ""The Virtual Bubble,"" will be developed to acquaint students and the public with biomedical uses of microbubbles and ultrasound in medicine. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to apply optimal control theory to determine optimal ultrasound waveforms that elicit a desired nonspherical response in encapsulated microbubbles used in biomedicine. The research objective is to determine the cost functions that yield the optimal acoustic forcing for enhancing the subharmonic acoustic response, and for inciting breakup of encapsulated microbubbles, subject to constraints dictated by patient safety. Single frequency, dual frequency, and broadband acoustic forcing schemes will be explored, and the effectiveness of each will be compared through metrics related to the desired microbubble response. An analytical model of nonspherical lipid-coated microbubbles will be developed to determine the cost functions that yield the optimal acoustic forcing waveforms. These predictions will be validated and refined using a more physically realistic numerical model. The predicted waveforms will be further validated experimentally with a novel setup that uses acoustic trapping to image the dynamics of ultrasonically-driven microbubbles and to detect their acoustic signatures. The capability to control nonspherical oscillations of encapsulated microbubbles has the potential to provide enhanced treatment that is highly specialized and reduces unwanted side effects by improving signal to noise ratios in imaging and reducing dosages in drug delivery."

The goal of this proposal is to develop an integrated approach combining molecular simulations and data analysis to enable the high-throughput screening of materials that modulate ice nucleation. The project will focus on two systems, one involving ice nucleation on self-assembled monolayers, and the second ice-nucleating proteins. The proposed approach is based on the hypothesis that there are characteristic signatures of a material's ice nucleating propensity within the interfacial water properties. The project aims to identify those signatures and formulate molecular descriptors that accelerate ice nucleation. The goal of the proposed education plan is to use an integrated approach to improve the understanding of the multidisciplinary field of computational materials science by graduate and undergraduate students. The proposed activities include a hackathon formulated in the context of computational materials science simulation challenges and a molLego touch-screen game (similar to Lego) aimed at constructing nanoscale materials in a visual learning environment.<br/><br/>The proposed research plan aims to understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of ice nucleation near self-assembled monolayers and ice-nucleating proteins. Computational tools developed in the PI?s group speed up sampling of nucleation events by more than a factor of 20 compared to traditional Molecular Dynamics simulations, thereby enabling studies of ice nucleation near surfaces. The plan is to analyze the extensive dataset of nucleation events, free energy landscapes, and interfacial water properties to identify the key signatures that indicate the ice-nucleating propensity of a surface. Based on knowledge of the key signatures, high-throughput screening of the surface nucleating propensity will be performed using membrane-based surfaces. The proposed research will potentially lead to computationally efficient cost-effective techniques for screening materials for ice nucleation propensity."

When water solutions of positively and negatively charged polyelectrolytes are mixed together, complexes are often formed that have either liquid-like or solid-like properties.  The ability to tailor these properties has led to their use in a variety of applications, ranging from personal care to industrial waste processing and water treatment.  This project is aimed at understanding how the relevant properties of these materials originate from the detailed structure of the components from which they are formed.  This understanding will be generated by developing a series of well-characterized model materials systems, and studying their mechanical properties with several experimental techniques.  In addition, new processing methods will be developed that enable polyelectrolyte complexes to easily be coated onto different material surfaces.  The characterization methods include the use of high frequency sound waves to probe the material response.  This technique is widely applicable to a variety of coatings with both protective and aesthetic functions.  The project is relevant to membranes for water filtration and includes education and research training of students, broadening participation, and outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Polyelectrolyte complexes formed by the interaction of oppositely charged macromolecules are an important class of soft, polymeric materials. These materials are of interest largely because of their mechanical and transport properties. The mechanical properties can span the full spectrum of behaviors from low-viscosity liquids to tough viscoelastic materials to brittle solids, in a manner that can be reversibly controlled through changes in the salt concentration or pH. The primary aim of this project is to understand the factors that control this behavior using well-characterized model systems. A secondary aim is to use this information to develop surface modifications to enhance the performance of membranes used for water purification.  The focus of the project is on polyelectrolyte complexes in thin film form, both because of the utility of these materials as surface modifiers, and because the thin film geometry is particularly convenient for the proposed investigations. There are three aspects of these investigations, beginning with new deposition mechanisms based on the electrochemical control of the pH at the surface of interest. The second set of experiments is aimed at mapping out the phase behavior of these materials, including the relationship between equilibrium water content of a film and the salt concentration of the aqueous medium with which it is in contact. The third element of the proposed program is the most extensive, and involves mechanical characterization of the polyelectrolyte complex films. Acoustic methods will be used to characterize the linear viscoelastic properties of these materials on a time-scale of about 60 nanoseconds, approaching the timescale that is accessible by molecular dynamics simulations, bridging the gap between experiment and computational modeling. In addition, the nonlinear properties of these materials will be investigated using creep and fracture experiments designed specifically for investigations of thin films in the hydrated state."

The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Alabama State University (ASU) will conduct research to address the current lack of ideal cell source for the therapy of hepatocyte transplantation (HT), which is considered as an alternative ""bridge"" treatment to liver transplantation until a donor liver becomes available. This project plans to create a new cell culture platform to better control stem cell behavior, leading to a possible solution to the shortage of hepatocytes for hepatocyte transplantation treatment. Non-human (porcine) hepatocytes will be used as a source of liver cells for this study. This project will enhance the academic capabilities and outreach activities at ASU.

Oregon Number Theory Days are targeted primarily at regional graduate students, postdocs, and faculty in number theory located in the Willamette Valley area in the state of Oregon. Each of the host institutions operates on a schedule of three terms per year, and the goal is to hold three seminars per year, one seminar per term, over the course of three years. The speakers will be distinguished researchers in number theory, or related fields of direct interest to number theorists, who are also known to be exceptional expositors. They represent an internationally diverse group of mathematicians, speaking on a wide variety of topics, including topics that are complementary to those already studied by local number theorists in Oregon. In particular, without this seminar series, these topics are harder to access by mathematicians in Oregon. Local postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students will also be invited to speak and present their most recent research in an encouraging environment. <br/><br/>Oregon is home to a growing community of researchers and students in number theory, but it is a low-population state which is geographically isolated from the traditional major centers of activity. This poses a significant financial challenge to students and postdoctoral faculty members for travel to conferences and workshops. Oregon Number Theory Days will feature presentations by high-profile international number theory experts on current research topics, which will be of great benefit to students, postdocs, and faculty residing in Oregon. In addition, it will help build a strong sense of community among the number theory researchers within the Willamette Valley area. This seminar series will host a diverse group of participants and speakers. The organizers of Oregon Number Theory Days believe that providing a broad representation of distinguished mathematicians is an important factor in the recruitment and development of underrepresented groups in academia. Oregon Number Theory Days will welcome every interested participant, and will particularly encourage graduate students to participate. This award will primarily be used to support the traveling expenses of local graduate and postdoctoral fellows to the hosting institutions."

In collaboration with medical professionals, the project will use these results to develop robotic systems for minimally invasive surgical removal of colon cancer and upper extremity rehabilitation.  The research is fundamentally linked to an educational plan that includes middle- and high-school engineering outreach, as well as undergraduate research and open courseware development.<br/><br/>This research is organized along three technical thrusts that advance soft and continuum robotics knowledge in modeling, design, and sensing.  First, the project will create a novel computational framework for the dynamics of slender elastic objects that extends and unifies existing models.  The proposed approach is a unique, high-order time-discretized solution method for the hyperbolic partial-differential equations of a Cosserat rod, which has potential for increased accuracy and efficiency. Second, this project will analyze and validate two novel concepts in the design of elastic robotic structures: high-strength, variable-curvature mechanisms, and concentric agonist-antagonist elastic actuation.  These concepts are aimed at addressing the tradeoffs of range-of-motion, strength, and compactness in continuum robot design. Third, new algorithmic approaches for shape-based distributed force sensing and elastic stability assessment for elastic objects are being developed and tested. The research plan culminates in efforts to advance knowledge of robotic medical intervention at the system level for minimally-invasive robotic surgery and robot-assisted rehabilitation."

The most successful segmentation algorithms map pixels onto a graph, define an energy function on this graph, and cast segmentation as a minimization of this discrete space using graph theory to compute minimum cuts, minimum paths, minimum spanning trees, or random walks on the graph.  While segmentations can be calculated automatically, semi-automatic interactive approaches based on user input are often preferred because segmentations can be ill-defined, ambiguous, and/or subjective for many applications.  Furthermore, while efficient for small images, graph-based algorithms scale poorly for large imagery, and in recent years consumer and scientific imagery has exploded in size.  This work will lay the foundation for novel algorithms for robust interactive segmentation of large imagery that provide actionable real-time feedback independent of the image size, fluid interactions that scale with the segmented object, interactivity without the need for a significant high-performance backend, and the ability to run on modest hardware like mobile devices.  The techniques developed in this research will not only provide fundamental contributions within computer science, but will enable significant advancements in applications across the sciences, in medicine and the arts.  More immediately, the project will support a graduate student who is a member of an underrepresented minority, and will provide the groundwork for a high-impact dissertation.<br/><br/>The work will focus on scalable algorithms for minimum cut and minimum path segmentations.  First, the research will target robust, hierarchical segmentation through the use of improved image filtering and the computation of multiple narrow bands.  This will improve on the state-of-the-art which currently either produces poor segmentations due to falling into local minima during the optimization, needs a significant high-performance backend, or relies on heavy heuristically-driven preprocessing.  Second, the work will design a novel query-driven, view-dependent segmentation that is produced as a user explores the large image and manipulates the segmentation without the need of the full resolution solution.  This enables the deferment of the expensive full optimization until after the interaction is completed.  User effort for interactions will be independent of the scale of the segmented object.  Assuring that the local, view-dependent solution is a valid representation of the full optimization without knowing the solution a priori will constitute a significant advancement to the state-of-the-art in image segmentation."

It is also one of the major sources of drinking water. However, through human use and activity, groundwater is being depleted and is vulnerable to contamination. As a consequence, the sustainability of this valuable natural resource is at risk and humans might be exposed to contamination. Novel simulation tools are needed to better understand transport of pollutants in aquifers. This is particularly important since such simulation tools allow to better manage polluted groundwater, achieve remediation in a cost-effective manner, keep our natural resources sustainable and protect human health. However, achieving this goal is a challenging task since contaminant transport in the subsurface environment is strongly affected by multiple factors. Among these factors, we highlight the ubiquitous presence of natural heterogeneity of hydrogeological properties, well pumping operations and the release conditions of pollutants. This project aims to develop a modeling framework that improves our fundamental knowledge of the joint impact of these factors on contaminant transport in the subsurface environment. The fundamental research will serve as a pathway to improved and integrated human health risk assessment. As part of the education and outreach activities, the research methods and results will be conveyed to high school students via a series of activities coordinated with local school teachers.  Through lectures focused on groundwater, STEM Academy high school students will (1) learn the importance of protecting groundwater resources and (2) reproduce Darcy's experiment with donated equipment constructed by graduate students. <br/><br/>This project aims to advance our knowledge of groundwater solute transport in complex heterogeneous subsurface environments through the development of a novel, integrative, probabilistic framework. A new physically and data driven framework will be used to investigate how the interaction between (1) solute source-zone distribution, (2) the spatial variability of the hydrogeological properties characterizing the aquifer, and (3) external factors (e.g., pumping rates induced by water supply demand) control the magnitude and the uncertainty in solute transport. A physically based stochastic methodology capable of assimilating hydrological data will be developed with the goal of incorporating hydrogeological complexities (normally encountered in real sites and applications), while also incorporating elements toward decision making which are relevant to public health. The hydrogeological complexities derive both from the multi-scale spatial heterogeneity of the aquifer's hydraulic properties, but also the effects of pumping strategies associated with water-supply demand. Combined, these factors will lead to complex flow topological features that will significantly influence the deformation of the solute plume and therefore its dilution rate. The framework developed in this project combines innovations in stochastic hydro-systems, statistical theory, information theory, and flow topology. Through the use of stochastic numerical and analytical simulations, this project will shed new knowledge on the importance of the abovementioned factors in controlling the magnitude and uncertainty of transport observables."

Many Americans struggle with their monthly cost for prescription drugs.  The production of pharmaceuticals is expensive, and a large portion of this production cost can be attributed to purification and isolation of a particular active component.  The aim of this CAREER project is to develop a new method for purification of biologically-derived active components that increases selectivity while maintaining the activity of the drug, thereby decreasing the cost of drug purification. <br/><br/>This project is aimed towards the development of a purification technology tailored for labile therapeutics, which are high-value drug biomolecules that rapidly and irreversibly lose their activity outside a narrow range of conditions in solution (such as pH or ionic strength).  The project will develop a single aqueous solvent purification process that is controlled by external stimuli, e.g. light and temperature, relatively mild stimulations that will retain the activity of the biomolecules.  New ligands will be developed that selectively captures two target biomolecules under visible light, or ambient temperature, and releases the drug in dark or cold. The newly developed ligands will be characterized in depth to allow for further product optimization and finally, validation of the technique by purifying target proteins from blood plasma and cell culture fluids.  The use of such simple, external switches to trigger the capture and release of the product holds great promise to considerably reduce the process footprint as compared to current setups. The use of a single aqueous solvent not only ensures product bioactivity, but also enables significant process intensification. The research entails the development of tools that have the potential to stimulate other research areas, and lead to the discovery of novel ?smart? materials and diagnostics that will have a positive impact on the quality of life of future generations. One graduate student will be trained in this project, a high school teacher will be involved in the laboratory work, and the PI will leverage his appointment in a biomanufacturing education and training center to interact with local biotech industries and commercial the intellectual property from this work."

Third, novel cyber-control methods are designed to guarantee the system scalability (enabling real-time transit service planning for urban scale trip demands), adaptability (allowing hub relocation and route re-planning to cope with trip demand dynamics), reliability (to traffic disruptions), and compatibility (providing inter-transit coordination with other transit services).<br/> <br/>CityLines system has the potential to reduce the overall travel time, for commute, grocery, entertainment, and more.

In natural populations, the persistence of variation of traits among individuals allows for adaptation to occur. Despite the central role of variation in the process of adaptation, it is poorly understood how and why variation persists in the face of natural selection eliminating less fit varieties. Chemical defense strategies (various types and concentrations of mustard oils) are highly variable across natural populations of the study species. These defensive compounds have known ecological effects, both as deterrents of insect feeding on leaves (above-ground effects) and as drivers of microbial community composition in the soil (below-ground effects). The researchers will test how plant growth and reproduction are influenced by the above- and below-ground effects of different chemical defense strategies on plant-insect and plant-microbe interactions. The project  provides opportunity for undergraduate training.  Planned outreach activities will target  middle and high school students, and also the general public during the Crested Butte Wildflower Festival.<br/><br/>The pleiotropic effects of plant defensive chemicals and the genes that underlie them are well documented. In addition to influencing fitness by mediating herbivory in aboveground environments, defensive chemicals can affect microbial communities in the soil immediately surrounding root tissue. It is likely that interactions between above- and belowground selective pressures influence overall patterns of natural selection on plant chemistry.  The investigators will test for pleiotropic above- and belowground effects of a chemical defense gene utilizing near-isogenic lines of the ecological model species, Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae), that vary in a gene controlling mustard oil biosynthesis to. They will first characterize the effects of defensive chemical profiles on microbial community assembly in the rhizosphere. Second, they will assess how rhizosphere selection affects plant fitness. Finally, they will test how the belowground context may modify aboveground effects of mustard oils as anti-herbivore defenses, and how interactions between the above- and belowground fitness effects of mustard oils result in the maintenance of genetic and trait diversity over space and time."

Stresses introduced during the processing of these materials, known as residual stresses, are ubiquitous in all materials and can have tremendous effects on performance.  Despite their presence and critical role in component life, many analysis efforts cannot account for residual stresses.  This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports the method development to characterize residual stresses at the micron level within polycrystalline materials. The research will lead to the development of a computational framework to account for residual stresses, and faithfully predict their distributions.  The research leverages recent advances in High Energy Diffraction Microscopy through collaboration with the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. This award also supports an innovative educational program that is twofold.  First, a series of continuing education courses will be developed focusing on the treatment of residual stress analyses produced in this research, specifically targeted towards the design systems, structural analysis, and manufacturing communities (i.e. non-materials) across professional societies.  Second, hands-on learning activities will be introduced within Purdue's Space Day, an existing grade-school outreach program, which will focus on residual stresses in aerospace materials.<br/><br/>In order to establish a basic understanding of residual stresses, the research team will: (i) develop a modeling framework to initialize and evolve residual stresses based on a backstress formulation present on individual slip systems, (ii) measure residual stresses and their development at the grain and sub-grain length scales within polycrystalline aggregates via high energy x-ray diffraction microscopy, (iii) develop techniques to map dislocation arrangements within the bulk of structural alloys, and (iv) produce validation datasets for crystal plasticity models containing state dependent variables that were previously impossible to measure. The work is predicated on a synergy between state-of-the-art experiments and simulations at the same length scale.  The results will unequivocally elucidate the role of residual stresses across length scales in polycrystalline materials, in order to develop more accurate lifetime predictions of the alloys and fabricate tailored components that offer either minimal or beneficial residual stresses and therefore are more resistant to failures."

Understanding the distributions of these elements and isotopes will increase the understanding of processes that shape their distributions and also the processes that depend on these elements. For example, many ""trace elements"" (elements that are present in very low amounts) are also important for life, and their presence or absence can play a vital role in the population of marine ecosystems.

The first part of this project examines the golden age of American innovation by undertaking a major data matching exercise linking U.S. patent records with data from Federal Censuses between 1880 and 1940 as a guide to the future. Then it studies the relationship between patented inventions and long-run economic growth, and outlines a framework for analyzing key macro- and micro-level determinants of innovativeness and growth. Over the last several decades economy-wide startup rates have declined in excess of twelve percent, while measures of factor reallocation and dispersion in firm growth rates have declined in excess of twenty percent. The second part of the project studies these changes in the U.S. economy. This part of the project focuses on understanding patterns of growth and innovation in the U.S. economy and ties together various empirical regularities using micro data from the U.S. economy. The goal is to understand the reasons for these changes and propose policies that can reconstruct entrepreneurship and job creation. The third part of this project studies the market for patents. How do non-practicing entities (NPEs) impact innovation and technological progress? This project provides new theoretical and empirical evidence on the subject.  In doing so the project informs the debate that has portrayed NPEs alternatively as benign middlemen that help to reallocate intellectual property to where it is most productive or stick-up artists that exploit the patent system to extract rents, thereby hurting innovation. As part of the project, the PI also plans to prepare a comprehensive set of online education materials on economic growth that will be freely accessible to everyone. The goal is to disseminate high-quality, but free materials to a broad range of students, including those who did not get the chance to study at a top institution.  The results of this research will contribute to economic growth, job creation and competitiveness of the U.S. economy.<br/><br/>Our understanding of macroeconomic growth and technological progress can be significantly improved by combining micro and macro perspectives. A macroeconomy is made of lots of micro firms that hire inventors to produce new innovative ideas. Therefore, this proposal--by focusing on the microeconomics of ideas, inventors, and firm behavior--aims to shed light on macroeconomic growth by capturing the rich heterogeneity in innovation behavior at the firm level by using the wealth of information on innovation and firm behavior. In addition, formal models allow us to make verbal notions operational and confront them with data. Therefore, this proposal also focuses on combining general equilibrium growth theories with rich micro data on millions of U.S. patents, inventors, and firms. By also using structural estimation techniques, this proposal will allow the PI not only to understand the underlying mechanisms, but also to do counterfactual policy exercises where the PI can study optimal industrial policy design."

Research based out of Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Deadhorse, and Kaktovik will address how changes in shoreline erosion and freshwater inflows to the coastal ocean over seasonal, annual, and longer timeframes influence near-shore food webs. Research will be conducted in collaboration with local stakeholder groups and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This research will advance our fundamental understanding of how input of materials from land and oceanographic conditions interact to influence coastal food webs. It will also allow us to track and understand: 1) how natural climate cycles influence coastal ecosystems in the Arctic, and 2) how climate change effects such as permafrost thaw, shifting precipitation regimes, and losses of sea ice alter coastal ecosystems.  Near-shore food webs along the Alaskan Arctic coastline support large populations of migratory fish and waterfowl that are essential to the culture of Iupiat communities of northern Alaska. The research at this LTER site will create a framework for anticipating the impacts of future changes on the coastal ecosystem that are of great concern to these communities. Results from this LTER program will also be of interest to a broader science community that is working to understand potential connections between Arctic change and global carbon cycling. Finally, this LTER project includes a strong commitment to education through graduate and undergraduate student involvement, post-doctoral mentoring, continuation of a very successful Summer Science K-12 Program in Kaktovik, and establishment of a parallel K-12 program in Utqiagvik. In addition, this project will employ native high school seniors or recently graduated students living in Utqiagvik and Kaktovik as field research assistants. <br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that the ecological framework for understanding what controls food web structure needs to be expanded to include temporal forcing. More specifically, there is mounting evidence that differential availability of seasonally-distinct resources is critical for defining trophic linkages and maintaining stability and resilience of food webs. This new LTER program will use lagoons along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast as experimental units to test this concept, and broaden it to include temporal variations over longer timeframes. The Beaufort lagoons are ideal for testing this concept because they experience extreme variability in seasonal cycles, which are now subject to rapid directional shifts driven by climate change. Our overarching question is: How do variations in terrestrial inputs, local production, and exchange between lagoon and ocean waters over seasonal, inter-annual, inter-decadal, and longer timeframes interact to control food web structure through effects on carbon and nitrogen cycling, microbial and metazoan community composition, and trophic linkages? Arctic lagoons provide a unique opportunity to study these interactions in the absence of fringing wetlands that often modulate land-ocean interactions in other lagoon systems. In addition, barrier island geomorphology, which exerts a strong control on water exchange between lagoons and the open ocean, is highly dynamic in the Arctic because sea-ice effects on coastal geomorphology are superimposed on the effects of currents, sea level, and waves. Thus, connections between inputs from land and lagoon ecosystems are more direct, and water exchanges between lagoons and the open ocean are more variable than is typical of lower latitude systems.  Specific study sites will be located in Elson Lagoon (western Beaufort), Simpson Lagoon and Stefansson Sound (central Beaufort), and Kaktovik and Jago lagoons (eastern Beaufort). The LTER will include seasonal field work during ice covered, ice break-up, and open water periods and also include sensor deployments for continuous measurements of key biogeochemical and hydrographic parameters."

Two distinct approaches will be pursued employing ABC triblock terpolymer self-assembly: One submits the terpolymers to non-solvent induced phase separation enabling asymmetric membrane formation, the other to transient laser heating to access temperature processing regimes hitherto unexplored for polymers. The aim of the proposed program is to understand the underlying fundamental chemical, physical and kinetic formation principles enabling generalization of results to other classes of materials. The proposed research includes synthesis of all components, preparation of porous nanostructured materials using the two non-equilibrium formation principles, and characterization of the final assembly structures using various scattering and electron microscopy techniques. Interdisciplinarity will be a central feature of the effort. The program will further involve training and development of human resources, including the participation of underrepresented groups, and industrial outreach."

While convex optimization algorithms enjoy global convergence guarantees, they are not always scalable to high-dimensional massive data. Motivated by the empirical success of nonconvex methods such as matrix factorization, the objective of this project is to develop a new generation of principled nonconvex statistical optimization algorithms to scale up high-dimensional machine learning methods. This project amplifies the utility of high-dimensional knowledge discovery methods in various fields such as computational genomics and recommendation systems. It incorporates the resulting research outcomes into curriculum development and online courses, to train a new generation of machine learning and data mining practitioners. In addition, special training is provided to K-12 students and community college students for a broader education of modern data analysis techniques.<br/><br/><br/>This project consists of three synergistic research thrusts. First, it develops a family of nonconvex algorithms for structured sparse learning, including extensions to both parallel computing and distributed computing. Second, it devises a unified nonconvex optimization framework for low-rank matrix estimation, which covers a wide range of low-rank matrix learning problems such as matrix completion and preference learning. Several acceleration techniques are also explored. Third, it develops a family of alternating optimization algorithms, to solve the bi-convex optimization problem for estimating various complex statistical models. This project integrates modern optimization techniques with model-based statistical thinking, and provides a systematic way to design nonconvex high-dimensional machine learning methods with strong theoretical guarantees. The targeted applications include but not limited to computational genomics, neuroscience, and recommendation systems."

Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) degrade over time, however, and these devices have a typical durable lifetime of only 10-15 years.  To date, there have been relatively few studies on modeling BHV fatigue, and there are no predictive models of BHV failure.  The methods created in this project can yield advanced fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of heart valve function as well as the first FSI modeling tools for simulating BHV valve failure.  By advancing broadly applicable FSI modeling technologies and their specific application to heart valve dynamics, the project aligns with NFS's mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing national health.<br/><br/>This project will integrate higher-order immersed boundary (IB) methods, peridynamics, and turbulence modeling to predict prosthetic heart valve function and dysfunction (fatigue and failure).  The project will advance cardiovascular FSI simulation accuracy by developing and analyzing two classes of sharp-interface immersed boundary (IB) methods capable of using experimentally constrained elasticity models with complex, three-dimensional geometries and integrating large-eddy simulation (LES) turbulence models with these new FSI methods.  This project also aims to develop new FSI methods for simulating tissue failure by integrating IB methods with peridynamics, which is a nonlocal formulation of solid mechanics that is well suited for modeling structural failure.  These models will be validated using experimental data obtained in ongoing studies at the FDA Heart Valve Lab.  These methods will be implemented within the open-source IBAMR software, which is used by many independent research groups in a broad range of fields.  This project also integrates research aims with an educational plan leverages UNC's outstanding high-performance computing environment, experimental facilities available to UNC's applied math group, and UNC's major new makerspace initiative, BeAM (Be a Maker).  Finally, research and educational products of this project will be incorporated into ongoing activities at UNC's main science outreach unit, the Morehead Planetarium & Science Center."

With the ultimate goal of building reliable, robust, and secure IoT systems that are usually composed of multitudes of unreliable wireless devices - sometimes even carried by malicious users - this project develops TRIP, a 3-in-1 integrated framework of TRuth discovery, Incentive, and Privacy preserving mechanisms for IoT systems. This framework consists of 1) a truth discovery mechanism that can distill true information from the deluge of sensory data generated by the ubiquitous IoT devices, 2) a security and privacy mechanism that can not only protect user privacy but also defend against malicious attack, and 3) an incentive mechanism that can select reliable participants in order to maximize the quality of collected information. The successful completion of this project, which for the first time systematically investigates an integrated design of IoT systems, will facilitate not only a whole spectrum of applications that have significant natural and societal impact, but also various curriculum development and outreach activities that can benefit a large group of students, especially the female and minority students.<br/><br/>In order to realize the proposed TRIP system, this project addresses a series of important research challenges. First, to infer truth information from the noisy and sparse sensory data collected by human-carried IoT devices, this project delivers a novel truth discovery method that can capture the variety in the reliability of different users as well as the correlations among the objects. Second, this project investigates not only privacy preserving mechanisms that allow the server to conduct truth discovery operations without knowing the genuine values of user observations, but also security solutions that defend against malicious users who try to inject false information for the purpose of sabotage or financial rewards. Third, an effective incentive mechanism is developed to motivate reliable users to contribute to the IoT tasks. Finally, the above mechanisms are seamlessly integrated into networked IoT systems in a distributed and parallel manner, and evaluated on real testbeds in order to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, and the practicality of the proposed research."

The goal of the GEOTRACES program is to understand the distributions of many elements and their isotopes in the ocean. Until quite recently, these elements could not be measured at a global scale. Understanding the distributions of these elements and isotopes will increase the understanding of processes that shape their distributions and also the processes that depend on these elements. For example, many ""trace elements"" (elements that are present in very low amounts) are also important for life, and their presence or absence can play a vital role in the population of marine ecosystems. This project will launch the next major U.S. GEOTRACES expedition in the Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Tahiti. The award made here would support all of the major infrastructure for this expedition, including the research vessel, the sampling equipment, and some of the core oceanographic measurements. This project will also support the personnel needed to lead the expedition and collect the samples.<br/><br/>This project would support the essential sampling operations and infrastructure for the U.S. GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect along 152 W to support a large variety of individual science projects on trace element and isotope (TEI) biogeochemistry that will follow. Thus, the major objectives of this management proposal are: (1) plan and coordinate a 60 day research cruise in 2018; (2) obtain representative samples for a wide variety of TEIs using a conventional CTD/rosette, GEOTRACES Trace Element Sampling Systems, and in situ pumps; (3) acquire conventional CTD hydrographic data along with discrete samples for salinity, dissolved oxygen, algal pigments, and dissolved nutrients at micro- and nanomolar levels; (4) ensure that proper QA/QC protocols are followed and reported, as well as fulfilling all GEOTRACES intercalibration protocols; (5) prepare and deliver all hydrographic data to the GEOTRACES Data Assembly Centre (via the US BCO-DMO data center); and (6) coordinate all cruise communications between investigators, including preparation of a hydrographic report/publication. This project would also provide baseline measurements of TEIs in the Clarion-Clipperton fracture zone (~7.5N-17N, ~155W-115W) where large-scale deep sea mining is planned. Environmental impact assessments are underway in partnership with the mining industry, but the effect of mining activities on TEIs in the water column is one that could be uniquely assessed by the GEOTRACES community. In support of efforts to communicate the science to a wide audience the investigators will recruit an early career freelance science journalist with interests in marine science and oceanography to participate on the cruise and do public outreach, photography and/or videography, and social media from the ship, as well as to submit articles about the research to national media. The project would also support several graduate students."

It is evident from looking at landscapes formed on glaciated plains of different ages that elaborate stream networks become established over time, reducing the abundance and extent of wetlands and increasing the extent of streams. However, the rate and mechanism of this ""drainage integration"" is unknown. The consequences of drainage integration are significant not only because erosional reshaping modifies the physical landscape, but also because it forges faster and more direct hydrological connections between uplands and streams. These hydrological connections have important implications for water resource management throughout these landscapes.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will combine laboratory simulations, computer modeling of landscape evolution, and field and geospatial analysis of stream network evolution in real Midwestern landscapes uncovered by Pleistocene ice sheets at different times in the last ice age.

Boiling and condensation are therefore critical processes in the energy landscape. Improved understanding of these processes can lead to increased efficiencies in power generation, refrigeration, and freshwater distillation. Boiling and condensation are governed by mechanisms that occur over a wide range of size scales, and the interplay between these scales is not yet well understand. For example, in boiling, vapor bubbles form in minute cavities on heated surfaces, grow and detach into the bulk liquid, and merge to form large gaseous structures. Flow and heat transfer effects at these three scales have been postulated to interact in a complex fashion. In this project, computational methods will be developed to predict interactions between scales in boiling and condensation. Experiments will be performed to assess and refine computational models. Resulting models and gained insights will guide engineering of enhanced energy system equipment to improve heat transfer performance and overall efficiency. In a complementary outreach effort, a new teaching module will be developed and implemented in diverse regional secondary schools, introducing energy issues and computer modeling skills. As part of this project, students will collect measurements of residential appliance energy consumption to be incorporated into a web-tool that provides guidance on appliance efficiency and environmental impacts for the public. Research on transport in energy systems will complement development and implementation of a teaching module and classroom-based research project for secondary school students in diverse regional communities introducing energy issues and computer modeling skills. Secondary school student measurements of residential appliance energy consumption will be incorporated into a public web-tool that provides estimates of efficiency and environmental impacts, and guidance on appliance age and cost tradeoffs. At the university teaching level, a new project-driven Energy Systems course will be developed in which students will develop public tutorial videos on key energy technologies.<br/><br/>This project seeks to characterize the coupling between micro-scale heat transfer and large-scale fluid dynamics in flow boiling and dropwise condensation through an experimentally validated multiscale simulation framework. By modeling small, dispersed features in an averaged sense, directly tracking trajectories of intermediate vapor and liquid features, and resolving large structures, this approach will capture interactions between scales, which have been understood independently. For flow boiling, this will be applied to study interactions between large vapor bubble wakes and bubble nucleation and the development of two-phase flow structures. For dropwise condensation, this approach will quantify the effects of transport properties on transient condensation and hydrodynamic contributions to heat transfer. The approach will be validated and complemented with experimental high-speed photography and thermal imaging studies. Simulation software will be released open-source to support research for applications in power generation, absorption cooling, water distillation, and electronics cooling."

Hydrates can be the basis of novel applications in many energy-water related areas such as natural gas transportation, desalination and carbon sequestration. A significant challenge associated with hydrate formation is the long wait time before hydrates start forming (nucleate), which can range from hours to days. Recent studies indicate that applied electrical voltages can significantly accelerate hydrate formation, and reduce the wait time by a factor of hundred or more. This electro-nucleation concept can enable rapid and controlled synthesis of hydrates for the above applications, all of which require rapid hydrate formation. This project is a fundamental study of the mechanisms underlying electric-field induced formation of hydrates. The influence of electric charge, current flow, heat transfer and surface chemistry on hydrate formation will be analyzed for three kinds of hydrates. Overall, this work will lead to seminal contributions in the fields of hydrates and liquid-to-solid phase change. The results of this project have the potential of completely eliminating the delay in hydrate formation, and enabling ""on-demand"" hydrate formation. Results from this research will be integrated into educational activities, which include the development of a graduate level course on Phase Change Heat Transfer and research opportunities for undergraduates and under-represented minorities.  <br/><br/>This project studies the electro-nucleation of three kinds of hydrates. In the first set of studies, hydrate formation from two immiscible liquids will be analyzed. Cyclopentane hydrate formation will be studied via experiments and analytical modeling to quantify the role of electric fields and interfacial charge on hydrate nucleation. In the second set of studies, hydrate formation from miscible liquids will be analyzed. Tetrahydrofuran hydrate formation will be analyzed to understand the influence of electric current and the resultant bubble generation on nucleation. The third set of studies will analyze electro-nucleation of methane hydrates, wherein hydrates nucleate at a liquid-gas interface at elevated pressures. This project includes nucleation-measurement experiments, analytical multiphysics modeling, and correlation development. Microfluidic cells will be fabricated to obtain statistically meaningful estimates of electro-nucleation. Specific outcomes of this project include measurements of electro-nucleation rates, and an understanding of the physics underlying the formation of various hydrates. This project will highlight the role of electric fields in fundamentally changing the nature of nucleation from stochastic to deterministic.

The presence of makerspaces has increased substantially over the last 5 years and are now commonly integrated into undergraduate engineering preparation programs.  The increased attention makerspaces are receiving in the STEM disciplines, and particularly within engineering education, provides justification for examining the influence of these spaces on undergraduate student development into professionals.  There is wide speculation that access to and interactions within makerspaces enhance engineering students' undergraduate learning experiences by exposing the students to activities that enhance their development as engineers.  Yet there is a lack of data supporting the notion that engineering students' involvement in university affiliated makerspace experiences and activities positively influences their professional development.  This project is conducting six case studies of university engineering education makerspace programs to determine the influence of makerspaces on the professional formation of undergraduate engineering students and the use and impact of makerspaces on faculty members.  Building upon the case studies, the project will develop and disseminate a national survey to engineering education students and faculty members working in makerspace-affiliated engineering education programs.  The project will increase our understanding of how makerspaces influence students' professional identity development, motivation, expertise, and propensity for persistence.  Data gathered from this project will document the sustainability and scalability of makerspaces in engineering education programs through examination of undergraduate engineering education students, faculty, programs, and institutions.  Finally, the work informs new lines of research regarding makerspaces in postsecondary professional engineering preparation programs. <br/><br/>Using six two-year long case studies and a nationwide survey, this project is examining the influence of makerspace integration into undergraduate engineering programs.  The project uses interviews, observations, focus groups and artifact analysis (e.g. course syllabi) to longitudinally study 6 makerspace-affiliated engineering education programs.  The project focuses on faculty members' and students' interactions with makerspaces and the impact the makerspaces are having on the development of students' professional identities, motivation, achievement, and persistence.  Case study data is being examined using content analysis applying both a priori and inductive coding approaches.  Case study analysis will inform the development of surveys for a nationwide assessment of makerspace-affiliated university engineering preparation programs.  The research project will inform new lines of inquiry about the formation of engineers and will provide those promoting makerspaces in engineering education programs with data to inform their development and support of their programs.  Results will be shared though host webinars and other virtual outlets.  In addition, via STEM-Central.net, the information is being shared with the larger STEM community and the American Association of Colleges and Universities about models of leadership and organizational structures in makerspaces that can improve the development of engineering students' professional identities.  Furthermore, in collaboration with the Cooperative Extension program at each of the investigators' home institutions, teaching and informative briefs will be disseminated to K-16 STEM teachers and communities through conferences such as the National Science Teacher Association, American Education Research Association, American Society of Engineering Education, and STEMTech. Overall, this work will inform makerspace leaders, engineering faculty members, undergraduate engineering students, and researchers and policymakers interested in makerspaces and STEM education."

A particular strength of these technologies is that they can provide interactive models that visualize complex concepts. Educational technologies typically use virtual models that students manipulate via mouse or keyboard. Yet, physical models that students manipulate with their hands can be more intuitive because they relate abstract concepts to students? bodily experiences in the real world. This CAREER project examines how best to integrate physical models into adaptive educational technologies. The project will focus on a domain where models play a crucial role in instruction: undergraduate chemistry. A series of experiments at 2-year and 4-year colleges will test whether physical or virtual models are most effective for particular concepts, in which order to present them, and how to help students make connections among them. Further, the team will develop a technology that can assess how students manipulate physical models. Results will be consolidated in a comprehensive theory of how physical and virtual models affect student learning. The results will help instructors select the best model for their students. The team will build on the results to develop an educational technology that adaptively selects physical and virtual models that is most helpful to the individual student given his/her learning progress. This research will yield a new type of educational technologies that blend physical and virtual models and that can adapt to individual students' bodily interactions. Such technologies can make STEM concepts more accessible to students with diverse backgrounds. Further, by involving students and instructors from 2-year colleges who often lack access to technology innovations, the project will broaden participation and enhance socioeconomic equality in STEM.<br/><br/>Students' difficulties in thinking in terms of visual representations jeopardize their learning in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) domains such as chemistry. Physical (tangible) and virtual representation modes have complementary benefits for students' learning. Yet, there is no comprehensive theory of how representation modes complement one another when students learn abstract content. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop such theory. Because effective combinations of physical and virtual representations are concept-, action-, and student-specific, they are likely too complex for instructors to achieve without support. Educational technologies can offer such support, but they cannot interface with physical representations. Hence, another goal of this CAREER project is to translate theory about representation modes into adaptive educational technologies that intelligently blend physical and virtual representations. A series of experiments in 2- and 4-year college chemistry will investigate how physical and virtual representations complement one another, how best to sequence them, and how best to help students make connections among them. User studies with instructors and students will investigate how educational technology design can address educational needs and systemic constraints in real learning contexts and how to support instructors in combining representation modes effectively. Further project activities will expand the intelligent blending framework to STEM domains in K-12 contexts. The project will contribute new theory about how physical and virtual representations complement one another. It will yield practical recommendations for the design of educational technologies that adapt to individual students' body-based interactions. A concrete deliverable will be an adaptive educational technology for 2- and 4-year college chemistry, available for free and disseminated to diverse populations. By including 2-year-colleges and by making this research applicable to STEM education in K-16 contexts, this project may broaden participation and enhance socioeconomic equality in many STEM domains."

The importance of evolutionary processes for the generation of biodiversity in isolated island systems is well documented. However, the question remains: can processes like speciation and adaptation lead to predictable outcomes during the assembly of biological communities on islands? This study aims to address this question by examining patterns of frog diversity in the Melanesian island archipelagos of the Southwest Pacific. Melanesian forest frogs provide an ideal system to study adaptive processes of diversification because they are distributed across multiple island chains and exhibit a similar set of habitat specialists (ecomorphs), which are unique to each island group. This study will test the hypothesis that these ecologically similar frog communities evolved independently in each archipelago, resulting in the convergence of entire species communities. This project will document a remarkable case of convergent evolution that could provide additional evidence bearing on the evolution and assembly of biological communities worldwide. Portions of this research will also include advanced undergraduate mentoring in science, including genomic sequence capture data collection and analysis. Additionally, the results of this project will be integrated into a classroom learning module geared toward teaching evolutionary concepts to Kansas high school students.<br/><br/>A major goal of this study is to resolve the evolutionary relationships among Melanesian Forest Frogs of the genus Cornufer using an exon capture sequencing approach. Phylogenomic data will be integrated with morphometric and ecological data from all species throughout the Melanesian archipelagos to test whether (1) frog ecomorph communities evolved in each archipelago through independent adaptive radiations, (2) ecomorphs evolved only once and subsequently dispersed across archipelagos, or (3) a combination of both. Macroevolutionary models will then be used to evaluate whether frog communities in each archipelago are more or less ecomorphologically convergent that expected by chance, which may suggest that adaptive diversification and community assembly has been nonrandom in Melanesian Forest Frogs. This study will promote the development of another rich, multi-faceted model system of adaptive radiation for a variety of conceptual evolutionary studies on the process of biological diversification and community assembly."

This award explores ""backward transfer"", or the ways in which new learning impacts previously-established ways of reasoning.  The PI will observe and evaluate students in four Algebra I classrooms as they learn quadratic functions. The PI will examine how different kinds of instruction about the new concept of quadratic functions helps or hinders students' prior mathematical knowledge of the previous concept of linear functions.  More generally, this award will contribute to the field of mathematics education by expanding the application of knowledge transfer, moving it from only a forward focused direction to include, also, a backward focused direction.  An advisory board of scholars with expertise in mathematics education, assessment, social interactions, quantitative reasoning and measurement will support the project.  The research will occur in diverse classrooms and result in presentations at the annual conferences of national organizations, peer-reviewed publications, as well as a website for teachers which will explain both the theoretical model and the findings from the project.  An undergraduate university course and professional development workshops using video data from the project are also being developed for pre-service and in-service teachers.  Ultimately, the research findings will generate new knowledge and offer guidance to elementary school teachers as they prepare their students for algebra.  <br/><br/>The research involves three phases.  The first phase includes observations and recordings of four Algebra I classrooms and will test students' understanding of linear functions before and after the lessons on quadratic functions.  This phase will also include interviews with students to better understand their reasoning about linear function problems.  The class sessions will be coded for the kind of reasoning that they promote.  The second phase of the project will involve four cycles of design research to create quadratic and linear function activities that can be used as instructional interventions.  In conjunction with this phase, pre-service teachers will observe teaching sessions through a course that will be offered concurrently with the design research.  The final phase of the project will involve pilot-applied research which will test the effects of the instructional activities on students' linear function reasoning in classroom settings.

Over evolutionary time, males and females can become very different from each other in behavior and structure, but the process behind this divergence is poorly understood. This research focuses on how social interactions shape the elaborate differences we see in nature. An excess of males or females can have a strong effect on many traits by changing how frequently an individual interacts with potential mates or rivals, and therefore how likely that individual's traits are to persist in later generations if they confer a mating or competitive advantage. Using the short-lived roundworm, this project measures the genetic differences between populations kept for 50 generations with mostly females, mostly males, or equal numbers of males and females. Analyzing genetic changes in these populations will reveal the processes by which evolution can alter traits in a population entirely due to male-female interactions. Moreover, comparing the genomes of multiple populations with an excess of males or females will address a core question in evolutionary biology: how similar are evolutionary trajectories when populations face identical conditions? This project will train undergraduate students from backgrounds underrepresented in science using modern genomic techniques, and produce online resources to educate high school students and the public about genomic methods and evolution.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to measure the genomic effect of selection on the differences between males and females and to quantify genetic changes resulting from the behavioral interactions that drive selection. Experimental evolution in the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei has yielded evidence that populations faced with a consistently male- or female-biased ratio of reproductively available males to females show differences in morphology and behavior as a consequence of selection. This proposal expands the question of behavioral interactions driving evolutionary change by quantifying the degree of genomic divergence across populations, and identifying signatures of selection at outlier loci across the entire genome. The proposed study will be among the first to directly measure evolution across the genome after a known selective regime of biased ratios of males to females, and one of the few to do so using a behavioral regime. Because experimental treatments were replicated across independent populations, the project will also address the long-standing question of how repeatable evolution is at the nucleotide level. Revealing the genomic consequences of selection generated by behavior is essential to synthesizing proximate and ultimate approaches to understanding dimorphism at the phenotypic and genomic level."

Because of this great need, the Welding Distance Community Outreach (WELDCO) program at West Hills Community College is designed to meet the needs for a growing sector of advanced welding technicians on the West Side of the California impoverished Central Valley. The program seeks to transport and make mobile a successful, face-to-face, welding program and offer it in geographically isolated areas within the service area of the college where career and technical education (CTE) has been historically very limited. Cultural changes will occur within the regional community as children of first-generation immigrants attain post-secondary education and gainful employment, thus creating a positive generational learning outcome. Further benefits will accrue to the region as adult learners, those already employed seeking to improve job skills, and the unemployed capitalize on the accessibility of this education program. The project will impact both the state and the nation as this education paradigm is shared with other community colleges and organizations for improving employer partnerships and growth. A robust project evaluation will study the impact of this project on business and industry and on the students and workers involved. <br/><br/>WELDCO is a cohort-specific curriculum design which includes variable integration of e-learning, Virtual Reality (VR) welding technology, and traditional training as a means of engaging nontraditional students. Formative and summative assessments will be employed to assess curriculum performance and modifications needed. The package takes full advantage of California legislative mandates and state funding for education programs (including high school pathways and post-secondary education) to enhance the impact on education and subsequent employment in the region. Students will benefit from the expanded internship opportunities and employer collaborations to help create a regional impact. This project focuses on 3 objectives: (a) development of a blended welding curriculum  to integrate e-learning, VR instruction, and traditional classroom instruction that will lead to American Welding Society (AWS) certification; (b) optimization of course delivery to maximize efficiency, effectiveness, and engagement by addressing student cognitive preferences and learning styles; and (c) implementation of population specific recruitment to include Hispanic, minority, and female students."

Since there is no direct way to image mantle flow, our knowledge about this process is limited.  This project will improve our ability to link seismic observations to deformation structure and flow geometry in the deep Earth.  In particular it will provide experimental data on the strength on rocks and minerals at the base of the mantle and will determine the microscopic mechanisms that lead to flow alignment of minerals in the deep earth. Understanding the dynamic processes at the base of the mantle will provide new insight into the mechanics and geometry of mantle convection.  High pressure and temperature deformation experiments performed during this project will also advance our understanding of the mechanical behavior of composite materials subjected to extreme pressure and temperature conditions.  In addition to basic science advances the outreach component of this project will improve undergraduate recruitment into geosciences through early exposure in secondary schools.  It will directly benefit the quality of secondary school education in Utah by providing mentoring and authentic research experience to secondary school teachers through the Masters of Science for Secondary School Teachers (MSSST) Program at the University of Utah.  In addition, through collaboration with MSSST teachers, the PI will develop geophysics teaching modules to be incorporated into secondary school earth science, physics, and chemistry courses. This project will also provide support and training for a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher.  <br/><br/>The D"" region, which lies just above the core mantle boundary (~2700-2900 km), plays a critical role in mantle convection.  Understanding the dynamic processes occurring in the D"" will advance our understanding of mantle convection.  Seismic anisotropy is observed in much of the D"" and is widely attributed to crystal preferred orientation (texture) of minerals that results from ductile deformation during mantle convection. If the relationship between deformation, texture, and anisotropy are understood, anisotropy can be used to map mantle flow.  Most interpretations of D"" anisotropy in terms of mantle flow are based on texture studies related only to deformation and in the context of single phase experiments.  However, high pressure diamond anvil cell experiments on lower mantle phases have documented a range textures that develop due to phase transformations.  Additionally the few texture measurements that exist for deformation of multi-phase lower mantle assemblages (rocks) suggest complex interactions between the phases. This project will use the diamond anvil cell and synchrotron radial diffraction to study orientation relationships and texture inheritance during bridgmanite and post-perovskite phase transitions and will investigate the effects of poly-phase deformation on texture development in lower mantle mineral phases. By understanding these processes, this proposal will enhance our ability to interpret seismic anisotropy in terms of phase transformations and mantle flow."

The response of polymer glasses to external forces (stretching vs. breaking) determines what materials can be used for particular applications but this response currently cannot be predicted. Experiments will be used to measure the rate at which polymer molecular motions occur when a force is applied to the polymer glass; in particular, experiments in which the glass is periodically stressed and unstressed will be utilized. Through comparison with models and computer calculations, these experiments will lead to the development of more reliable predictions of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses.

Making use of this data to gain insight into complex phenomena requires characterizing the relationships among a large number of variables. Graphical models explicitly capture the statistical relationships between the variables of interest in the form of a network. Such a representation, in addition to enhancing interpretability of the model, enables computationally efficient inference. The investigator develops methodology to infer undirected and directed networks between a large number of variables from observational data. This research has broad societal impact, as it affects application domains from weather forecasting to phylogenetics and to personalized medicine. In addition, the PI is one of the initial faculty hires in a new MIT-wide effort in statistics. As such, the PI has major impact on creating new undergraduate and PhD programs in statistics to train the next generation in big data analytics, crucial for taking on challenging roles in this data-rich world.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study probabilistic graphical models using an integrated approach that combines ideas from applied algebraic geometry, convex optimization, mathematical statistics, and machine learning, and to apply these models to scientifically important novel problems. The research agenda is structured into three projects. In the first project, the investigator develops methods to infer causal relationships between variables from observational data using the framework of directed Gaussian graphical models combined with tools from optimization and algebraic geometry. The end goal is to apply this new methodology to learn tissue- and person-specific gene regulatory networks from gene expression data such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. In the second project, the investigator develops scalable methods for maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian models with linear constraints on the covariance matrix or its inverse. Such models are important for inference of phylogenetic trees or cellular differentiation trees. The third project is an application of graphical models to weather forecasting; the investigator develops new parametric methods based on Gaussian copulas and also non-parametric methods for the post-processing of numerical weather prediction models that take into account the complicated dependence structure of weather variables in space and time."

Consequently, more effective K-16 instructional approaches are needed to help make engineering accessible and interesting to broader populations. This study draws from previous research in disciplinary literacy instruction, a promising teaching approach that has led to positive outcomes among underrepresented students in disciplines such as history and science. Under a model of disciplinary literacy instruction in engineering, students learn to read and write like an engineer through guided practice in evaluating and creating authentic texts in the service of engineering design activity. The purpose of this foundational research is to advance knowledge by developing a robust model of disciplinary literacy in engineering. To achieve this goal, the study will identify the common literacy practices used by engineers from four different sub-disciplines (aerospace/mechanical, biological, civil/environmental, and electrical/computer) who each work at different engineering companies. This study will describe the ways in which these engineers use shared frameworks to evaluate and create texts. This study will use these findings to develop a model of disciplinary literacy and curricular materials for use in K-16 classrooms. The exploration will establish the foundation for a trajectory of future research that will ultimately test the model of disciplinary literacy in engineering in diverse K-16 classrooms.<br/><br/>Although disciplinary literacy instruction has been shown to produce positive outcomes for underrepresented students in several academic disciplines, empirically-based models of disciplinary literacy instruction have not been developed and tested in the discipline of engineering. The purpose of this early stage design and development research is to advance knowledge by developing a robust model of disciplinary literacy in engineering that can be tested in diverse K-16 classrooms. A multiple, comparative case study will describe how eight engineers from varied companies and sub-disciplines (aerospace/mechanical, biological, civil/environmental, and electrical/computer) use literacy practices to solve problems through engineering. A constant comparative analysis of think-alouds, observations, and interviews with each engineer will result in the identification of common cognitive frameworks that engineers use while they interpret and generate core texts. These findings will be translated into a model of disciplinary literacy in engineering, with accompanying leveled classroom materials, designed to support K-16 students in thinking like an engineer as they read and write authentic genres in the service of engineering design activity. This instructional approach is expected to broaden participation by providing underrepresented students with literacy instruction designed to support their engagement with engineering. Future studies will test whether disciplinary literacy instruction leads to positive outcomes, such as an improved ability to engage in complex engineering design processes, among underrepresented K-16 students."

Resources relating to food and feeding, also known as trophic resources, have been a leading factor in driving the diversity of life on this planet. One of every three living vertebrate species is an acanthomorph fish, a group of spiny-ray finned fishes that includes cichlids and many reef fishes. Members of this group consume a wide variety of resources, ranging from scraping scales off other fish, filtering plankton from the water, biting off chunks of coral, or actively hunting other vertebrates. How effectively the fish feed on these resources is intimately connected to their physical anatomy, especially how well the fish can maneuver and capture prey. Some anatomical traits are thought to lead to increased speciation or decreased extinction rates (these are known as key innovations) but may limit possible flexibility in diet evolution. This is the key question addressed by this research. In addition, this research compares how communities of different ages are shaped by their trophic ecologies. Acanthomorphs are also common aquarium fish, providing a great opportunity to educate the public about form and function in biology, which this research will do by producing interactive software.<br/><br/>Understanding the ecological factors that generate and maintain diversity is a major goal in biological research. Trophic ecology is one such factor and is a major driver of evolution. Acanthomorph fishes provide the perfect system to study trophic evolution as they are extremely speciose and diverse in their trophic ecology and morphology. Specifically, this research investigates how trophic ecology may promote or constrain rates of morphological evolution, how morphological key innovations may constrain or promote rates of diet evolution, and how communities of different ages may have different patterns of trophic evolution that have shaped the respective fish fauna. This research will use comparative phylogenetic methods and, for young radiations, phylogenomics, to elucidate relationships of species and test these hypotheses in a comparative evolutionary framework. This research will provide insight into how diet evolves and the macroevolutionary consequences that trophic ecology has on morphology."

By analyzing the behavior of the simulation programs, scientists and programmers can achieve significant efficiency improvements enabling better simulations and more useful results. This program analysis often involves visualizing the graph of dependencies between different parts of the program and different parallel computing resources. However, there may be hundreds of thousands of parallel devices and thousands of computer instructions involved. Current visualizations are difficult to interpret at this size. This project develops visualization approaches that overcome this limitation, giving programmers the support to analyze and optimize large-scale simulations and ultimately accomplish more science. At the same time, this project furthers the understanding of how to design scalable visualizations which may then be applied to other large and complex data.<br/> <br/>The objective of this research is the creation of visual encodings and interaction techniques supporting the exploration and analysis of computing dependencies at scale.

This project will test the efficacy of different depictions of this regularity through controlled user studies. In determining the interactivity needs of program analysts, this project will conduct a design study resulting in an interactive visual approach for exploring program control and data flow.

Concepts are basic ideas that are often the foundation of academic courses. Examples of concepts are an understanding of the stresses and strains that occur when a structural member, such as a beam or column is loaded. Common practice in academic settings is to present concepts as the relation between relevant variables and understanding how to determine unknown variables in close-ended problems. In engineering practice, however, concepts are utilized to conduct engineering design, within project constraints. Engineering concepts can be embedded in design codes, design software, and in other ways where the characteristics of the concepts are not represented in the same way as the academic setting. This project will study how concepts are represented in academic and workplace settings. Research findings will be used to iteratively develop engineering design problems that are relevant to engineering practice and useful to civil engineering instructors. These problems will be actively disseminated through the civil engineering and engineering education communities. The results will inform current educational approaches to preparing engineers for the workforce by studying the fundamental concepts that make up engineering curricula.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to investigate the nuanced and complex ways of knowing, representing, and communicating concepts of structural and geotechnical engineering concepts specific to building design in both civil engineering practice and academic settings using robust, in-depth, and iterative educational research methodologies. The project will examine and test theories of situated cognition in an engineering work setting, as well as challenge the fundamental premises of engineering education that tend to isolate concepts from application. The research objective will be achieved through three efforts: 1 - Develop a prioritized list of structural and geotechnical engineering concepts related to building design with practicing civil engineers and civil engineering faculty using the Delphi method, 2 - Understand and compare the representation of structural and geotechnical engineering concepts in building design within authentic workplace and academic settings using ethnographically informed research methods, including participant observation, formal and informal interviews, and document analysis, and 3 - Iteratively develop problems and solutions that structural and geotechnical engineers and faculty deem as authentic to building design, and that faculty are willing to adopt into their curriculum. This study will be the first to compare the representation of concepts in academic and workplace settings, specifically within the interdisciplinary environment of building design. The expected outcomes of this project are detailed accounts of differences in concept representation of academic and workplace settings and what they mean for theories of situated learning and for the preparation of engineers for the workplace. Homework, in-class, and test problems created will enhance engineering students' awareness of concepts as they apply them to multiple practical contexts."

The project develops the technology for a crucial next step in recognition: active and action-centric image understanding by semantic understanding of actions, their preconditions and effects, and visual planning.  Doing so empowers several applications in healthcare, prospective memory failure care, visually impaired care, elderly care, robotics, entertainment, and education.<br/><br/>This research addresses the visual planning problem that entails knowing what actions are, how they change the world state, and which sequences of actions change the current state to a desired one. Successful active understanding of images requires addressing several fundamental and challenging problems at the intersection of computer vision and artificial intelligence. The research is focused on the development of a framework for active visual understanding, new scalable algorithms for joint detection of actions and their arguments, new datasets and representations for actions' preconditions and effects, new algorithms for predicting the consequences of actions with intuitive laws of physics, and visual semantic planning. The developed framework is designed for active and action-centric image understanding by large-scale, semantic action recognition, modeling actions' preconditions and effects, predicting consequences of actions, and visual planning. These resources not only enable new research directions in computer vision, robotics, and AI, but also bring together some of the independent efforts across these disciplines."

DRG are part of the nervous system next to the spinal cord. Recently, DRG are being looked at as a place to stimulate to help people with different medical conditions such as chronic pain, spinal cord injury, and amputation. Current electrodes that stimulate DRG can be improved. This would allow for increases in patient care. We believe that a greater understanding of DRG function will help lead to electrode improvements.  Two main research studies will be performed. First, small electrodes will be used in and near the DRG in animal studies. These studies will improve understanding of the signals made by DRG nerves. Second, the cell types in DRG will be studied and a computer model of the DRG will be created and validated.  This model will improve our understanding of how the DRG functions and allow for the development of treatments that can be directed towards the DRG, such as to improve pain control or impact bowel and bladder function in individuals with paralysis.  Outreach activities are planned that will expose middle school through college students to the exciting world of bioelectricity. Workshops will be held for local youths on how the nervous system works. In addition, a computer game will be created that teaches the basics of the nervous system.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to electrophysiologically and anatomically characterize end model dorsal root ganglia (DRG). DRG are unique nervous system structures where cell bodies for sensory neurons are concentrated next to the spinal cord. DRG have become an attractive location for therapeutic intervention, with applications ranging from chronic pain modulation to bladder control after spinal cord injury; however current electrode interfaces with DRG for clinical care and preclinical studies lack efficacy. While individual DRG neurons have been well characterized and utilized in in vitro neuroscience applications, the arrangement and electrical characteristics  f in vivo whole DRG is not understood. This project will measure in vivo electrophysiology characterization of DRG-electrode interactions<br/>as well as developing an in silico prediction of DRG-electrode interactions.  The model will provide the ability to predict partial- and whole-DRG activation and neural signals for electrical and sensory stimuli.  The educational objective of this proposal is to develop new and expand upon existing bioelectricity educational materials within and outside the University of Michigan by focusing on students from middle school through university level.  In addition, a mobile game will be developed that can be used to interest and education K12 students as well as the general public about neuroscience."

New forms of financing, such as crowdfunding, combined with new financial regulations, have the potential to encourage entrepreneurship outside of traditional clusters, thereby increasing the spatial distribution of economic growth.  In particular, aspiring entrepreneurs that are overlooked by traditional sources of finance might be more likely to receive support.  Likewise, small investors that have not been allowed to invest in risky ventures can now seek a small share of the profits of successful startups. Furthermore, crowd feedback, in the form of a response to a campaign, has the potential to highlight good ideas and winnow bad ideas more quickly.  After mapping and describing the distribution and characteristics of crowdfunding, this research develops theory and (causally if possible) tests the mechanisms for how crowdfunding could impact many phenomena including firm formation and survival, venture capital investment, investment between (rich and poor) regions, patenting, scientific research, employment, and industry concentration.  Policy makers have supported crowdfunding in the hope that it will spread opportunity to a wider segment of society.  TThis research ultimately seeks to answer the question of whether crowdfunding can reduce regional inequality in access to startup capital.<br/><br/>Internet platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, ask for support and advice for campaigns and provide the data for this project. To establish the spread and impact of crowdfunding, this research investigates its impact on regional economies and demonstrates that crowdfunding is relatively higher outside of traditional bastions of venture capital investment such as Silicon Valley, Boston, and New York.  Furthermore, regions with successful crowdfunding, where campaigns reach their funding goals, subsequently draw in greater venture capital funding.  This effect is particularly strong for regions with successful technology campaigns (as opposed to art and theatre campaigns).  This research considers the impact of crowdfunding on job creation, employment, venture start up, and industry concentration and informs policy by providing insight into the mechanisms, benefits, and distribution of returns from crowdfunding."

This project will contribute towards the national need for basic research related to improving computational thinking and problem solving abilities in the workforce by investigating students' learning and understanding of key topics and ideas from combinatorial mathematics. However, there is abundant evidence that students struggle to understand and solve combinatorial problems. Such struggles create a perennial difficulty for mathematics instructors, who find it challenging to teach combinatorics. Currently, innovative combinatorial curricular materials fostering computational approaches do not exist for undergraduate classrooms. To improve the teaching and learning of combinatorics, the project will investigate how computational activity (such as writing programs or developing algorithms) affects the ways in which undergraduate students solve and reason about combinatorial problems. The project will develop curricular materials that leverage computational activity to elicit rich student engagement with combinatorial problems and to improve instruction of combinatorial problem solving. The project will promote teaching and understanding of mathematical content to a variety of populations, including mathematics students, computer science students, and instructors, and it will establish interdisciplinary connections between mathematics and computer science education.<br/><br/>The project will consist of iterative design experiments to develop instructional tasks that require computational activities to solve combinatorial problems. The innovative research idea underlying this project is to leverage the current computational interests of the field as a setting to improve students' combinatorial problem solving. The work builds upon prior results that demonstrate benefits for students when they systematically list outcomes as they solve combinatorial problems. By engaging in the computational activities of programming and writing algorithms, students will gain opportunities to list outcomes on a wide range of problems and contexts, especially problems for which the set of outcomes is too large to enumerate by hand. The curricular materials will be in the form of modules that will be implemented in mathematics classrooms at multiple universities. The success of the project will be evaluated based both on the qualitative insights that are gained about students' combinatorial reasoning in computational settings, and the modules' efficacy in improving students' combinatorial problem solving. The project stands to advance the field of mathematics education in at least three ways: (1) it will offer insight into students' combinatorial thinking in computational settings, which entails the ways in which students cognitively reason about the mathematical domain of combinatorics; (2) it will deliver research-based curricular materials for the teaching of undergraduate combinatorics via computational activity that have been tested and refined through classroom implementation; and (3) it will lead to the mathematics community gaining a better sense of broad principles involved in computational thinking, and the relationship between computational activity and mathematical thinking and learning."

After organisms die, some portion of this carbon sinks into the deep sea where it dissolves back into the water or lands on the seafloor. The Biological Carbon Pump is the name for this carbon transfer out of the sunlit surface ocean, and it is a very important process controlling the earth's carbon cycle and climate. Surprisingly, the size and rate of this transfer remains unclear because data for carbon in particles are not available for many times and places in the ocean. The researcher for this project plans to collect a remarkable new data set and examine it to answer major questions about the Biological Carbon Pump. The data will come from joining existing cruises on research ships sailing through all of the world's oceans, creating a systematic global survey of particles in the ocean. These data will be the heart of a new public database for use by other international researchers in their continued study of the Biological Carbon Pump. For this young researcher, the project will also lay the foundation for a career of integrated research, education, and outreach in oceanography. An Alaskan native will go to sea and analyze data, using these results to complete a Ph.D. degree. In addition, the project will design and produce a new aquarium exhibit at the Alaska SeaLife Center (ASLC) to educate the public about the complex workings and global importance of the Biological Carbon Pump.  These activities should increase diversity in oceanography and inspire a new generation of scientists. <br/><br/>Reliable and useful data on the Biological Carbon Pump is sparse, mostly due to the experimental, logistical, and technical challenges of studying a complex system over the great expanse of the global ocean.

In collaboration with the US Repeat Hydrography program, this project will use in situ imaging technology to determine the total abundance, size distribution, and functional groups of particles and mesozooplankton along seven global ocean transects. The design will test fundamental hypotheses related to the presence and nature of regional particle hotspots and examine the global patterns of zooplankton activity and vertical migration as they affect the biological pump. Links between satellite data, calculated flux patterns, attenuation of particles through the mesopelagic, and constraints on biogeochemical models will also be investigated."

A primary motivation for this research is to broaden the scope of classical shrinkage approaches to model selection and inferential goals in new statistical problems by providing computationally efficient and statistically accurate solutions. The methodology developed in the project has broad applications ranging from genetic and epidemiological studies to communication networks. The principal investigator is committed to increased interactions and collaborations with the broader scientific community to maximize the impact of the statistical methodology developed through this project. The deliverables of the project include user-friendly software packages that enable users in the scientific community to analyze structured data sets in applications relevant to the project goals.<br/><br/>The principal investigator proposes a class of generalized shrinkage methods for model selection and inference in structured high-dimensional models. Operating in a Bayesian framework, the proposed approach shrinks the parameters of an encompassing model towards a family of sub-models. Given a class of statistical models, the principal investigator defines an encompassing model as one which assigns a positive prior probability to arbitrarily small neighborhoods of any model in the specified class, with the neighborhoods defined in terms of some general statistical divergence measure such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This general formulation enlarges the scope of traditional shrinkage mechanisms by employing shrinkage towards potentially non-nested models. Model selection is performed by post-processing the posterior summaries from the encompassing model. The principal investigator develops novel post-processing schemes for variable selection and clustering, tensor decompositions, tree-structured models and network topology identification as various applications of the general methodology. The principal investigator formulates information theoretical techniques for studying non-asymptotic frequentist behavior of the encompassing posterior distributions, with specific emphasis on providing theoretical support for the model selection procedures developed in this project."

This led to a new subfield that is sometimes called ""the Polynomial Method"". The philosophy behind this subfield is that collections of objects that exhibit an extremal behavior often have hidden algebraic structure. As a simple example, if a finite set of points in the plane contains many pairs that are at a distance of 1 from each other, one might expect this set to have a grid structure. Once the algebraic structure is found, it can be exploited to gain a better understanding of the original problem. To expose the algebraic structure, one defines polynomials on the studied objects and explores their properties by using algebraic tools, often from Algebraic Geometry. For example, for a problem involving a finite set of points in the plane, one might wish to study the properties of a minimum-degree polynomial that vanishes on the point set. Beyond solving various longstanding problems, this new subfield is also leading to the discovery of interesting connections between Combinatorial Geometry and other fields, such as Harmonic Analysis and Theoretical Computer Science. This project is based on the assumption that the new ""algebraic era"" in Combinatorial Geometry has not yet reached its peak. It investigates further problems that seem approachable via algebraic techniques, and aims to further develop the current algebraic tools.<br/><br/>The first part of this project involves studying several main open problems in Discrete Geometry by using algebraic methods. Specifically, studying the distinct distances problem in R^d, the characterization of point sets that determine few distinct distances, and the problem of deriving stronger and more general bounds for incidence problems. Part of the importance of deriving stronger incidence bounds is that many problems can be reduced to incidence problems (including problems from Combinatorics, Harmonic Analysis, and Number Theory). The second part of the project concerns connections between Discrete Geometry and Additive Combinatorics, also by using polynomial methods. This partly involves further studying known connections between the two fields, but focuses mainly on establishing a new type of connection. This connection consists of defining geometric variants of additive energy and extending some of the known additive energy results to these variants (such as the Balog-Szemeredi-Gowers theorem and higher moment energies)."

However for over 100 years researchers have struggled to explain why no single species can exclude all the others. It is thought that species can coexist only when the ability of each to outcompete the others is limited by something different. For example, they may each need different resources for growth, be infected by or eaten by different things, or need different environmental conditions. However, showing that this idea holds in nature has proven difficult.  This project will build on existing research on plant coexistence in sagebrush steppes. This research shows that the plant species that are most common coexist because of differences in what limits how successful seedlings are at getting established. These differences in establishment are suspected to be caused by differences in the fungal pathogens living in the soil and infecting roots of the different species. In this study, the researchers will use a field experiment, greenhouse experiment, and computer models based on historical and experimental data to find out how big the role of fungal pathogens is in maintaining the coexistence of plant species. The sagebrush steppe that this work will study is an at-risk ecosystem that has economic and conservation importance. This research will be useful to land managers working in these systems, because it will increase understanding of how important native plant species can be helped in their regeneration. Therefore it will lead to improved ways to manage and restore this ecosystem. The results will be used to create fact sheets for use by land managers, and will be made available to them and to others through existing networks of state, federal, university and NGO personnel interested in sagebrush steppe conservation.<br/><br/>Progress in empirical coexistence research requires integration of modern, quantitative approaches such as population modeling, with classical mechanistic approaches such as experiments targeting specific coexistence mechanisms. This proposal combines these approaches by focusing on one potential mechanism that has recently generated tremendous interest and is likely important in perennial vegetation: plant-soil feedbacks (PSF). First, a field experiment will quantify intra- and interspecific effects of fungal PSFs on germination-emergence and establishment. A companion greenhouse experiment will address questions about differences between field and lab-based PSF studies, and place this case study in the context of the current literature. Second, results from the field experiment will be incorporated in an existing, phenomenological multispecies population model, enabling comparisons of the overall stability of coexistence under a scenario in which only PSFs drive interactions at the recruitment stage, and a scenario including all possible sources of intra- and interspecific effects on recruitment. By combining field experiments, greenhouse studies, long-term demographic data, and models, this work will quantify the contribution of PSFs to the overall stability of coexistence in a sagebrush steppe community. This novel experimental and modeling framework can be extended to other communities and coexistence mechanisms in the future."

This project will further develop these connections and explore new applications, which will help identify which problems can and cannot be solved by efficient computational processes in other areas of computer science.

The PI will develop the mathematical techniques needed to prove new simulation theorems and obtain quantitative improvements to existing ones.

The project will also explore new applications of such connections, such as obtaining new lower bounds and separations for communication complexity measures, developing a theory of ""fine-grained extension complexity"" for linear programming, answering structural questions about communication and about how efficiently the complexity of a given function can be estimated, as well as studying fundamental open questions about the behavior of query complexity measures."

Understanding how these interactions with other species have shaped an organism over time is key to understanding how and why that organism is the way it is today, which is fundamentally important to understanding the complexity and diversity of nature and very useful when trying to control an organism with an economic consequence. Many types of wasps inject their eggs into the body of another living insect, which hatch into larvae that consume the host. Wasps in the subfamily Microgastrinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) use a specialized virus, polydnavirus, to prevent their hosts, caterpillars, from destroying their eggs and larvae. Microgastrine wasps are one of the most important ecological and agricultural natural enemies to the caterpillars of butterflies and moths, including many agricultural pests. This research will compare the genomes polydnaviruses from a small group of closely related microgastrines. This group of microgastrines was at one point a single species that attacked 1-3 species of host caterpillars, but evolved over time into about 20 species that each attack different caterpillar species. The goal of this project is to identify which virus genes changed the most and which changed the least as this group of wasps evolved into several different species which have adapted to different hosts. This will identify which virus genes have universally important functions for disabling caterpillars' immune defenses and which genes may have specific functions that are adapted to work in a specific host. This will contribute to understanding how polydnaviruses help microgastrines adapt to new host caterpillars, how they are able to adapt to thousands of different caterpillar immune systems, and why there are so many species of microgastrines. This is especially important for understanding why some groups of organisms evolve into many more species than other groups of organisms, and for discovering new ways to control caterpillar species, many of which are important agricultural pests.<br/><br/>Polydnavirus genes that interfere with host immunity are hypothesized to evolve rapidly in an evolutionary arms-race with the host immune adaptations. Polydnavirus genomes are integrated into the microgastrine wasps' nuclear genome. Parapanteles Ashmead is a small microgastrine genus with well-studied microgastrine host use patterns. A draft genome of Parapanteles continua has already been sequenced and assembled and putative polydnavirus genes have been identified within it. This research will sequence and assemble the genomes of 20 more Parapanteles species, annotate their polydnavirus genes, and phylogenetically investigate how these genes have evolved, especially in relation to host-switches."

Unfortunately, these ecosystems are severely threatened due to their importance in the cement industry. This is especially notable in Southeast Asia where extensive tracts of karst outcrops are being quarried to the ground, resulting in the inevitable extinction of numerous species of plants and animals. Consequently, conservation efforts have been geared towards the discovery and description of new species to highlight the importance of this ecosystem as imperiled arks of biodiversity. However, relatively little research has focused on understanding the mechanisms that have generated this biodiversity. This project aims to elucidate the genetic mechanisms responsible for the evolution of karst-adapted organisms by investigating how genes interact with the environment to drive the formation of new species. Results from this study will not only aid in informing conservation measures in threatened karst habitats worldwide, but will also contribute towards the understanding of how species adapt to an ever changing environment.<br/><br/>Bent-toed Geckos of the genus Cyrtodactylus exhibit a wide array of specialized ecotypes that are associated with different habitats. Among these, karst-adapted species have evolved independently six times in three distantly related clades in Malaysia, indicating that the diversification of karst lineages may be ecologically driven (ecological speciation). The replicated evolution of karst adaptation in Bent-toed Geckos represents a unique and compelling natural system to determine whether geckos transitioning to karsts are subjected to ecologically-based divergent selection that ultimately leads to speciation. Because karst ecosystems are characterized by unique geomorphological features and physiochemical conditions that set them apart from non-calcareous environments, divergent selection is expected to act on independently evolving karst lineages that occur in separate but similar karst environments. This study will use genome-wide SNP data obtained using a double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRADseq) protocol due to the availability of large numbers of independent loci across the genome, which enable the detection of departure from neutrality and signatures of selection. A hybridization capture using RAD probes method (hyRAD) will then be used to obtain comparable and orthologous loci among more distantly related groups. Signatures of ecologically-based divergent selection can then be detected by identifying genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with environmental variables using a latent factor mixed model (LFMM) method. Additionally, karst and non-karst lineages are expected to be in different stages of reproductive isolation, with older lineages showing less (or a complete lack of) gene flow among populations compared to lineages that have diverged more recently, in which gene flow may be common."

The availability of controlled ex vivo CNS models can lead to platforms for 1) investigating human developmental biology and physiology, 2) investigating degenerative diseases and traumatic injury, 3) enhanced drug screening and personalized medicine and 4) eliminating the need for questionably relevant animal studies.  The goal of this project is to develop methods for engineering human cord organoids displaying spinal cord grey matter architecture and CNS-like neuronal circuitry.  Success could lead to a paradigm shift relative in spinal cord injury research and drug screening.  The proposed methods can be implemented to engineer diverse neural, heart, and gut organoids.  The education and outreach plan includes:  1) development of a comprehensive ""Stem cell-based Tissue Engineering & Morphogenesis (STEM)"" website to serve as an educational resource for BME courses and middle and high school teachers and as a site for sharing research findings, 2) outreach programs designed to expose underrepresented minority (URM) students, including at elementary and middle school levels, to STEM experiences and 3) creation of a live ""Building a Human Spinal Cord"" exhibit to engage the public in stem cell and tissue engineering research.<br/><br/>This project will use innovative culture platforms to develop standardized methodologies for reproducibly engineering human spinal cord organoids, chosen due the spinal cord's comparatively simplified tissue morphology. The Research Plan is organized under 3 objectives with related hypotheses: 1) Engineer human neural organoids with posterior neural tube (PNT) tissue structure--The hypothesis that spatial control of organoid morphology at developmental length scales can induce biomimetic tissue structure will be tested using a novel molding technology to develop a standardized methodology for engineer annular tubes of polarized, hPSC-derived neural stem cells (hNSCs), which is mimetic of early PNT structure, 2) Engineer human neural organoids with dorsoventral (D/V) cytoarchitecture mimetic of spinal cord grey matter tissue--The hypothesis that exogenous morphogen gradients can be applied to instruct biomimetic cellular composition and tissue cytoarchitecture within organoids will be tested using novel ""Stamp-On"" microfluidics to generate analogous morphogen gradients and investigate whether they can recapitulate D/V patterning of biomimetic cellular composition and cytoarchitecture within cylindrical hNSC organoids and 3) Engineer human neural organoids with rostrocaudal (R/C) cytoarchitecture mimetic of spinal cord grey matter tissue--The hypothesis that directed assembly of neural organoid tissues can induce formation of biomimetic neural will be tested by using organoids generated from cervical, thoracic, and lumbar hNSCs and testing whether their directed assembly yields a composite spinal cord organoid with biomimetic R/C tissue cytoarchitecture and functional neuronal circuitry.  The 4th objective is to promote development of a diverse workforce for future hPSC-based tissue engineering industries by integrating a multifaceted approach for inspiring and educating the general public and students, especially underrepresented minorities.  Though Human PSC-derived organoids possess tremendous possibilities for modeling human biology and physiology, their utility is limited by a lack of control over their spontaneous morphogenesis processes, which produces random organoid structure and composition. Using a spinal cord organoid exemplar, this project will develop novel tools and methodologies for engineering human organoid morphogenesis at the micro-to-millimeter scale. Instructing reproducible ex vivo morphogenesis at this scale is critical for developing advanced biomanufacturing processes to produce functional, biomimetic tissues and organs. Engineering parameters identified as critical to instructing emergence of biomimetic 3-D spinal organoids could elucidate broadly applicable morphogenesis engineering principles and provide new insights into CNS development and disease.  The tools and knowledge generated will significantly advance scientists' ability to engineer biomimetic human tissues, specifically providing the most humanoid experimental platform to date for investigating degenerative spinal cord diseases and traumatic injury. The proposed tools and methods are designed for simplicity, thus can be broadly disseminated and implemented for engineer human organoids. Captivating data and explanations of human organoid morphogenesis will be curated as an online educational resource and introduced to the general public and students to promote political support, interests, and workforce development."

Physical flexibility combined with cost and weight advantages opens a wide range of application areas, including wearable electronics, medical sensing and rollable displays. However, the performance and capabilities of purely flexible electronics are currently much more limited than the silicon technology. Emerging flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) integrates rigid silicon chips and printed electronics to bridge the gap between today's complex systems and flexible electronics. Hence, FHE can drive the next big leap forward in the form factor design, similar to the shift from desktop and laptop computers to hand-held devices. FHE systems differ significantly from traditional computing systems. First, physical flexibility and stretchability expands the design space into an uncharted dimension, which introduces intricate trade-offs with the traditional power, performance and area metrics. Second, bending and stretching can alter the characteristics of FHE systems. Finally, large batteries and heat sinks are prohibitive due to flexibility and wearability constraints. Therefore, there is a need for theoretically grounded and practically applicable tools that quantify physical flexibility as a new metric. The proposed project will advance the state-of-the-art in FHE by developing modeling, flexibility-aware optimization and run-time management techniques. <br/><br/>FHE can be an enabler for ubiquitous devices for wearable computing, internet-of-things, body sensors, and medical applications. This project will help in transforming lives by providing a systematic approach to design wearable systems and arbitrarily shaped objects. For example, FHE can enable electronic patches equipped with motion, physiological and biochemical sensors, and wireless transceivers. These patches can be used to examine movement disorders anytime and anywhere, in stark contrast to the current practice, where a patient has to stay in a clinical environment. The educational goal of this project is to enrich the engineering curriculum with FHE. A digest of research outcomes will be presented to undergraduate and graduate students through a new course. This project will also provide hands-on training to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to strengthen the STEM workforce pipeline."

It is often thought that the genes underlying convergent evolution within species are similar, but this is still an open question. This proposal uses a nucleic acid sequencing method to which genes are turned on or off at any time. This information is then compared with tail color patterns of guppies. Tail coloration is highly variable trait and plays a key role in mating displays. The project will identify color genes in different fish at different locations to understand if the same genetic signatures result in similar patterns. The study will advance scientific knowledge by answering questions concerning the predictability of evolution, and will provide research opportunities for undergraduates at one of the most ethnically diverse universities in the nation. <br/><br/>This proposal focuses on convergent evolution. Specifically, the researchers address two questions: 1) How similar are visible color patterns among individuals from genetically diverged populations? and 2) Will genes differentiating extreme color patterns within a population be convergent among individuals from genetically diverged sites, and if so, which ones? For the first question, the researchers will analyze photographs of male guppies from five sites and sort the patterns into color categories. The researchers hypothesize that there will be convergence in the color patterns of males from genetically diverged populations. The second question will be answered using next generation DNA sequencing. For each of the five sites, tissues from males with colored and uncolored tails will be sequenced. The differentially expressed genes between tail color types at one site will be compared to the differentially expressed genes between tail color types at the other sites to test for convergence. The researchers will be able to determine if phenotypic convergence is correlated with expression of the same genes, different genes within the same pathway, or different pathways."

Wireless networks in such environments can enable various applications, ranging from environmental sustainability, homeland security, to military and defense automation. However, existing wireless networking techniques, including electromagnetic wave-based solutions, acoustic wave-based solutions, and magnetic induction-based solutions, do not work in the aforementioned extreme environments, especially when the target environment has lossy media and complex structure and when the device is small and mobile. In this project, a new networking paradigm, Metamaterial-inspired Networking (MetaNet), will be developed to wirelessly internetwork portable (or even smaller) devices in extreme environments. MetaNet will generate significant impacts by providing a new networking platform to establish wireless connection in extreme environments. It can positively impact many human activities and can eventually address many key problems, such as increasing oil/gas recovery factor, protecting groundwater, mitigating the impacts of natural disasters, establishing smart cities and smart buildings, and enhancing the safety of military and law enforcement personnel.

Moreover, since M2I significantly enhances the magnetic coupling among the wireless devices as well as the conductive objects in the environment, the much closer interactions among all the nodes as well as the environment create both opportunity and risk for network design. The objective of this project is to explore for the first time the fundamentals of metamaterial-inspired networking in various extreme environments through a closed-loop combination of mathematical modeling, simulations, and experimental evaluation. This proposed plan is based on four core intertwined research tasks: (i) physical layer solutions based on channel analysis of M2I communications in various environments; (ii) environment-aware and cross-layer network control techniques; (iii) network topology-discovery and localization algorithms; and (iv) prototyping and performance evaluation through a MetaNet testbed and a cross layer simulator."

Missing in the literature is a study that tests these population-level findings in a species-level context, specifically, one that correlates differentiation in male mating signals and female perception. If changes in female perception are met with changes in male signal, the project will support a novel finding: that similar mechanisms are at work across species as across populations. This also suggests that sexual signals may be constrained by female physiology, and that changes in female physiology allow for changes in male signal diversity.

Next, they will measure female perceptual spectra from 10 species using a visual physiology technique that determines the absorption of specific wavelengths of light through single photoreceptor cells in the eye. The researchers will then determine the amount of overlap of male sexual trait spectra (the color of the bioluminescence) and the female perceptual spectra. If population genetic theory holds, and preference is determined by perception, we expect covariation between male signals and female physiology."

Evolution might occur rapidly and quickly enough to rescue populations and protect species from being lost in the face of a changing environment, including by the increasing salinization of freshwater wetlands around the world. As wetlands grow saltier, many freshwater wetland organisms such as fish, turtles, and frogs may become locally extinct.

Genome size is also important to consider when planning DNA sequencing projects, as larger genomes require more resources than small ones. An important barrier to understanding the patterns that cause genome size variation is how few measurements there are. Currently, genome size estimates exist for only 0.4% of animal species. This number is so small due to how difficult it is to get a reliable estimate. Traditional methods rely on specially prepared cells from living organisms. However, live specimens can be difficult or impossible to obtain for species that are rare, endangered, or extinct. Fortunately, there are new methods to estimate genome size using DNA sequencing that do not require living tissue. This project will examine the reliability of DNA sequence-based genome size estimates on both live beetles and old, preserved specimens from museum collections. No previous experiments have specifically compared these methods or tested their reliability in old specimens. This project will also contribute additional data points for the broader study of genome sizes across the tree of life, and will further the use of museum collections in the study of the world's diversity. <br/><br/>Next generation sequencing (NGS) has given researchers a new set of tools for estimating genome size. This project will investigate the viability of NGS coverage-based methods for determining genome size in carabid beetles by performing flow cytometry and shallow Illumina sequencing on ten species of carabid beetle. It will also determine if genome size estimation by coverage analysis can be reliably employed on preserved material from museum collections by repeating shallow Illumina sequencing on old museum specimens of the same ten species. A total of 36 genomic libraries will be prepared and sequenced across four Illumina lanes. Coverage-based analyses will be performed on all resulting sequences, and the resulting genome size estimates will then be compared with those obtained by flow cytometry using a one-way ANOVA test to determine if coverage-based estimation is a viable alternative for both fresh and museum specimens. If shallow genome sequencing is successful in estimating genomes sizes, it will allow for the study of material from the world's natural history museums without the cost of extensive fieldwork to collect fresh material. This could potentially transform the study of genome size by increasing the number of species it is possible to analyze by orders of magnitude."

Yet the specific pathways through which close relationships promote optimal well-being and thriving are not well understood. This project offers an integrative theoretical model describing interpersonal processes that influence human thriving. The goal of this project is to test a model of social support and thriving developed from an integration of three literatures - the positive well-being literature, the social support literature, and the close relationships literature. This model highlights two life contexts through which people may potentially thrive, it proposes two relational support functions that promote thriving in each life context, and it identifies mechanisms through which relational support is likely to have long-term effects on thriving. The model is tested by examining close relationship processes over time in couples who have been married for over a decade. This perspective can help us understand how social support may be a critical interpersonal process that contributes to couples' thriving, and also to individual well-being.<br/><br/>This project examines an integrative model of social support as an interpersonal process that influences thriving. Couples (N = 160) who were newly married in 2005/2006 will again be investigated as they enter their 11th year of marriage. A longitudinal data collection includes surveys with the aim of predicting long-term thriving from observations and surveys obtained in the first years of marriage. The data collection also includes an observational and physiological session to examine the effects of relational support functions on mechanisms that drive long-term thriving outcomes, including physiological mechanisms. The data collection also includes a daily diary component to examine the effects of relational support functions on proximal outcomes. Lastly, in the 12th year of marriage, couples will complete follow-up assessments of thriving with the aim of prospectively predicting thriving from the interpersonal processes assessed in the 11th year of marriage. This project provides a foundation for understanding interpersonal processes and their role in thriving, and the development of relationship-based interventions aimed at promoting public health. This is especially important because social support is a major contributor to well-being and mental health in the U.S. and across the world."

Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Delaware State University (DSU) will conduct research aimed at addressing a major gap in knowledge in the regulation of gene expression. This project will be used to enhance teaching and learning at DSU with a focus on mentoring and training freshman and sophomore students. The proposed research experiences will provide access for undergraduate STEM students, mainly from underrepresented minority groups, to participate in advanced cellular, molecular and biophysical investigations at DSU. The early involvement of STEM students in active research will increase the retention and graduation rates in STEM as well as increase the production of highly qualified students for graduate school and the STEM global workforce.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed study is to understand the mechanisms by which CD44 regulates gene expression in the cell. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) characterize protein-protein interactions between CD44 intracytoplasmic domain (ICD) and transcription factors Runx2 and/or p53 in cells and to assess the CD44-mediated functional expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 gene (MMP-9) in the chick embryo model; and 2) map a CD44-ICD minimal binding domain in the protein-protein interactions with p53 and/or Runx2 and to assess its potential use as a small molecule modulator of the CD44 signaling pathway. This proposal combines in vitro and in vivo cellular, molecular and biophysical experimental approaches to investigate how protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions between the CD44-ICD and transcription factors and gene promoters, respectively, regulate gene expression.

Domestic horses and their relatives (zebras and donkeys) are large, grazing animals with slender limbs that end in a single digit (the hoof). The evolution of today?s horses is traditionally explained as simple ongoing adaptation to grasslands: as grasslands gradually took over from forests, the early dog-sized, three-toed horses evolved into large, single-toed grazers. Their teeth also became longer to deal with abrasive grass, while their digits reduced so they could run faster or more efficiently across open spaces. However, this textbook explanation is oversimplified and remains largely untested. This study will shed light on a significant evolutionary transition that culminated in one of humans? most culturally and economically important species. Results will be featured in the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH), whose fossil horse exhibit currently shows the oversimplified pattern of evolution. They will also be shared via lectures designed to engage with members of the public, as well as teacher education events at the HMNH that will bring this project into the classroom.<br/> <br/>A variety of hypotheses have been proposed for the selective pressures driving digit reduction in the horse lineage: speed for predator escape, economy of movement over open grasslands with scarce resources, and compensation for increasing body size. However, none have been explicitly tested with modern methods. By integrating information on fossil occurrences, trait change, phylogenetic relationships, ecology, and environment, this project aims to directly test potential evolutionary causes of digit reduction in horses. Specifically, this research will use ecological and phylogenetic comparative methods to assess the following questions: 1) Did tridactyl and monodactyl horses overlap in space and time or did they occupy separate niches? 2) Are changes in digit morphology, body mass, tooth height, or habitat correlated across the horse phylogeny? 3) Do changes in digit morphology or environment influence speciation and extinction rates in the fossil record? The results of this project will provide quantitative support (or lack thereof) for the cause of digit reduction in fossil horses, filling in a key gap in our understanding of why this major evolutionary transition happened."

Fighting infection requires individuals to invest energy in immune responses. These responses can deplete energy supplies that would otherwise be used for growth, maintenance, and reproduction, particularly when energy is limited. Individual organisms may be energy limited when nutrients are not available or when their genes do not allow efficient processing of nutrients into energy supplies. The research will also address questions about how fighting infection changes metabolic rate. By using the model genetic organism, Drosophila melanogaster, which has natural immune responses that are similar to humans, this project will generate critical information on how genetic variation in energy metabolism affects the ability of human cells to fight infection. This research will also be used to design new exercises for introductory biology laboratories that will help students synthesize information across diverse topics covered in introductory biology courses, from evolution to immunity and physiology.<br/><br/>This project tests the prediction that the energy required to activate the immune system during development decreases the ability of individuals with inefficient energy metabolism to fight infection, and creating a resulting decrease in future adult reproduction. The project connects the effects of interactions between innate immunity and energy metabolism pathways at the organismal, molecular, and physiological levels in a well-studied genetic system. The experiments take advantage of a well-characterized set of genotypes, one of which has a disrupted mitochondrial-nuclear interaction that results in inefficient energy metabolism. Objective 1 will quantify whether flies with inefficient energy metabolism have lower infection survival and greater deleterious consequences for reproductive fitness after infection by a natural pathogen, Providencia rettgeri. Experiments will also modify the nutrient diet to further decrease the energy available for immune responses in all genotypes. Objective 2 will measure the activation of underlying molecular pathways and aspects of cellular energy metabolism to explain effects on tradeoffs between immunity and reproduction. Experiments include quantifying levels of antimicrobial peptide induction, measuring the amounts of key proteins in energy-sensing pathways, assessing the bacterial load during infection, and monitoring indicators of the cellular energetic state and organismal metabolic rate during infection."

In high-income settings, household income is frequently used to measure economic status. However, in low-income settings, researchers usually must rely on alternative measures based on what a household owns and what basic services it has access to.  Every year, hundreds of studies by social scientists and policymakers use these asset-based measures of wealth to examine how household economic status shapes human development and to evaluate poverty alleviation efforts and economic growth.  However, current asset-based measures rely on untested assumptions about how households can reach economic prosperity and whether there are multiple pathways to economic advancement in different contexts.  The current project will determine the validity and robustness of different asset-based methods for estimating household wealth using samples representing over 80% of the world's current population.  This will provide a robust foundation for the measurement of household wealth in applied social science and public policy fields, including economic development and population health, which frequently rely on asset-based measures for identifying disparities and at-risk populations.<br/><br/>The proposed project takes a two-pronged approach to assess which measures of household wealth best capture policy-relevant benchmarks of achievement.  Such benchmarks will include physical growth, educational attainment, and personal and community assessments of satisfaction and relative economic standing. At a macro-level, the project expands on an ongoing 6-year project compiling and analyzing household wealth measures in over 120 low- and middle-income countries.  At a micro-level, the project focuses on several communities that vary in terms of livelihood - farming, fishing, livestock, and rural/urban wage labor - and cultural background.  The findings and data tools from the project will build a foundation for future researchers to assess economic resources that are both locally meaningful and broadly comparable and that can improve our understanding of the linkages of material wealth with human outcomes across a range of communities."

The project will also investigate several finiteness results in differential algebra; this line of work is expected to have consequences on effective bounds in number theory and in computational differential algebra. The project aims to develop various aspects of the model theory of supersimple and superstable groups as a generalization of recent work in differential algebraic and difference algebraic groups. The project will investigate the classification of disintegrated strongly minimal sets in differentially closed fields.

Their rise pushed several other plant lineages to extinction or severely reduced their diversity. Ferns are the only exception to this pattern. Rather than being marginalized or driven to extinction, ferns actually thrived and diversified in both the forest understory and the newly available canopy. Ferns and lycophytes are unique among land plants in having two independent stages of the life cycle (haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte), both of which had to adapt to the new environmental conditions created by the rise of flowering plants. Many tropical, epiphytic fern gametophytes evolved to produce more leaves than their terrestrial counterparts, which enable them to live longer and to reproduce without producing spores. These are highly beneficial traits in the competitive canopy environment that may actually have enabled ferns to diversify rapidly in these habitats. The increased independence of the gametophyte means that ferns can postpone the production of sporophytes if conditions are unfavorable. As a result, in several epiphytic species we observe a pattern of spatially separated generations, in which the gametophyte can grow in a much broader range of conditions than its sporophyte. Several of these fern species with long-lived gametophytes grow in Hawaii, where ferns remain understudied. This project will investigate the ecology of these ferns in Hawaii, particularly the environmental conditions that favor the evolution of independent gametophyte populations. Temperature, light levels, and precipitation will all be measured in order to understand the ecological dynamics that govern sporophyte and gametophyte production. One graduate student and several undergraduates from the University of Florida and University of Hawaii at Manoa will be trained in diverse field and laboratory methods.

It will investigate the evolution of Ice Age stone tool weaponry, dated to13,500 to 12,500 years, used by hunter-gatherers in the colonization of North America. The weapons, stone point tips attached to spears and called ""Clovis points"" by archaeologists, were flintknapped into specimens with parallel to slightly convex sides, a concave base, and flake-removal scars; termed ""flutes."" These flutes occur on one or both faces and on average extend from the base to about a third of the way to the tip. These points are found across North America, having spread widely and rapidly at an unprecedented rate. During this expansion over space, across time, and in different environments the size and shape of Clovis points changed significantly. Archaeologists know that cultural drift contributed to this variation, but is it possible that this single source could alone generate so much variation so quickly? Or are multiple sources, for example cultural drift + functional changes, necessary to so rapidly give rise to such variety? If functional differences are found among different forms of Clovis points, it follows that Clovis people in different times and places may have chosen specific attributes to provide them with a selective functional advantage. The project will contribute to the overall understanding of how and why weapons evolve among small, mobile, isolated groups of humans; a fundamental anthropological question of broad archaeological and ethnographic relevance, as well as to many situations in the present day. Furthermore, since the peopling of the Americas was part of the broader late Pleistocene global dispersal of human out of Africa, this project will ultimately advance the understanding of the behavioral and technological adaptations that determined how our species came to so successfully colonize the planet. <br/><br/>The investigators will examine whether different sizes and shapes of Clovis points possess any functional advantages or disadvantages. Through a series of realistic hunting-related experiments in conjunction with a series of controlled engineering experiments, the researchers will determine the prey penetration-ability, aerodynamics, durability, fracture mechanics, and cutting-efficiency of replica Clovis points of varying forms."

A crowd-powered database system uses groups of people called ""the crowd"" to help with answering users' queries by recruiting them to process data using criteria that are subjective and/or require visual or semantic interpretation. For example, a user may want to find a set of faculty job postings in which the job description discusses a commitment to diversity and for which the school is in a safe location; interpreting each job description and researching crime statistics are tasks well-suited for people to perform. The system can coordinate crowd workers to process data more efficiently than the user alone could, which is advantageous when there are more than a handful of data items to process.

For example, queries such as determining which research articles about a certain medical device contain experimental results comparing this and other devices, or finding out which of a set of jewelers only use ethically sourced metals and stones and also ship to Alaska. Database systems are designed to optimize the efficiency of query processing of individual users. A query often involves multiple parts, e.g., for the job postings query these are (1) filter out jobs that do not describe a commitment to diversity and (2) filter out jobs for schools in an unsafe location. A job that does not meet the first criterion does not need to be processed for the second one, and vice versa. The processing order for the parts of the query influences how much computation is needed and how long the query will take to process. Traditional database systems have information about how long parts of a query will take and the likelihood of items satisfying filters; they use this information to choose an efficient processing ordering for a query. However, this information is not known for crowd-powered database systems. The usefulness of optimizers for crowd-powered database systems hinges on their ability to find an efficient way to process a user's query when this information is unknown before processing the query. The aim of this research project is to tackle this challenge by developing a system to process queries involving multiple filtering criteria that observes the execution environment and adjusts its processing strategy as the query executes. This project will have broad impact by yielding a query processing system that will empower users to ask more interesting questions about data, advancing research in allocating human computation resources in dynamic environments, as well as training a group of undergraduate students both in research and in the principles of systems design.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to build a cost-based query optimizer for crowd-powered filter queries for which important statistics used in optimization are unknown at query time. These statistics include traditional metrics such as filter selectivity as well as new contributors to query cost such as the time it takes crowd workers to complete a unit of work and the number of workers needed to reach consensus for a subjective evaluation. The project takes an adaptive approach to query processing: while the query is running, the system observes cost and selectivity information and periodically reorders the query plan operators to reduce overall query cost. The researchers will demonstrate that their query optimizer yields query costs that are comparable to costs from the optimal crowd-based query plan for which selectivity and subjectivity information is known a priori.

Perhaps the most immediate is the production of scaffolds for soft tissue reconstruction surgeries where the scaffold has improved mechanical properties. Long-term applications are significant and range from constructs for drug evaluation to replacement organs. The PI's education and outreach plan includes development of courses on biofabrication as well as a centralized biofabrication web-based knowledge resource, as well as extensive outreach to K-12 students and the broader bioprinting community. Specifically, the PI will develop a Bio-Design and Manufacturing summer workshop for high school students and collaborations with the North Carolina Science Museum. <br/><br/>The use of a standing ultrasonic wave in additive manufacturing with cell-infused bionics leads to orientation in reinforcing fibers. Leveraging the PI's expertise in biomedical design and manufacturing, multidisciplinary collaborations, and lab capabilities, this project will generate new knowledge about fundamental material-process-structure-function interactions in the ultrasonic manipulation of 3D encapsulated cells, nanofibers and cell-secreted extracellular matrix (ECM). The outcomes will confirm if aligned polymer nanofibers within a hydrogel can guide fibrous ECM formation along their alignment trajectory better than aligned encapsulated cells alone (without nanofibers). The validated analytical and empirical models will provide a multivariate mapping of UAB parameter interrelationships with functionally-critical cellular and ECM responses. For the first time, the 3D-bioprinting of human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and annulus fibrosus tissue constructs with biomimetic ECM organization will be achieved."

A complex network of regulatory genes that are responsible for resistance to high levels of toxic chemicals and for control of normal cell growth was recently discovered in a number of these extreme microorganisms.  This study will test whether the network of regulators stops the cell cycle and growth until damage from toxic chemicals is repaired.  Ultimately, this work will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms that organisms use to survive under inhospitable conditions.  In terms of broader impacts, science inquiry immersion workshops will be developed in which K-12 students, K-12 teachers and undergraduates will contribute directly to the research project through hands-on research experiences. These workshops are intended to spark scientific curiosity and improve perceived self-efficacy in science for all participants. These programs are expected to reach thousands of high school students and hundreds of undergraduates during the project period, and to foster the recruitment and retention of talented students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Cells use gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to tune growth and division in response to the external environment. Recent work of the PI has led to the hypothesis that a novel network of transcription factors in Archaea functions as a checkpoint that regulates the cell cycle in response to damage from stress. This checkpoint may provide flexibility and robustness in response to extreme and variable conditions endemic to the habitats of many Archaea. However, regulatory mechanisms of cell cycle progress are unknown in Archaea, primarily due to the lack of tractable test organisms and live cell assays. The proposed work will overcome these obstacles using a unique systems biology approach pioneered in the PI's lab. The objectives are: (1) Characterize the topology, dynamics, and phenotypic output of the stress checkpoint regulatory network in Archaea using experimental and computational methods; (2) Collaborate with students and teachers as critical team members in data generation and GRN analysis. The research results will provide a firm foundation for the PI's future career goals: to provide a fundamental understanding of how environmental conditions shape the underlying regulatory network through evolutionary time across the tree of life. In terms of Broader Impacts, the proposed research aims to spark scientific curiosity and improve perceived self-efficacy of undergraduates as well as K-12 students and teachers by providing real hands-on research experiences. The PI will collaborate with area high school teachers and the state science museum to teach high school science immersion courses and implement teacher-training workshops. Undergraduate research opportunities will be offered in the classroom and lab.

We still know very little about the biodiversity of microbes, though extending our knowledge has the potential to advance the national interest in relation to ecosystem health. This project focuses on one group of microbes, namely the testate (shelled) amoebae, which are abundant and top predators in New England bogs and fens. Testate amoebae have a rich history of classification based on the shape and composition of their tests (shells); yet these traits have been shown to be misleading in relation to their identification, because there are many cryptic species. Hence, this research project relies on molecular tools to explore their biodiversity across time and space. Such studies are important given that testate amoebae serve as markers for changing climates and are abundant in threatened wetland habitats like bogs and fens. Beyond scientific discovery, this research project will train a group of undergraduate women plus a postdoctoral fellow on the biodiversity of microorganisms. <br/><br/>Testate amoebae have been used as bioindicators in both paleoecological and contemporary studies, and some taxa are argued to be top predators in Sphagnum dominated habitats.  This research project will illuminate the diversity of testate amoebae from bogs and fens within New England and across seasons.  Comparison of morphological and phylogenetic species, defined initially based on two molecular markers and then by multilocus delineation through transcriptome analyses, will allow exploration of the biodiversity of this clade.  The work will probe the ecological factors that drive the distribution of testate amoebae by assessing fine (local) and larger (New England) scale variation.  Patterns among community members will also be characterized using high-throughput sequencing of target regions in the genome, which allows detection of rare community members.

These systems evolve rapidly because the competition for market share pushes developers to come up with new features or improve capabilities over existing ones. These software changes may require hardware replacements or upgrades to capitalize on software upgrade opportunities. As such, developers must ensure that changes do not cause any unintended impact to the existing quality of the systems. Regression testing has been widely used to assess whether changes have adversely affected system behavior. While significant work has been accomplished by the software engineering community in improving effectiveness and efficiency of regression testing, most of the existing techniques focus on traditional software that is environment-independent and non-distributed. Real-world software systems, however, are far more complex: they frequently interact with the environment via hardware devices, and employ various concurrency mechanisms to coordinate interrupts, signals, threads, and processes. These characteristics affect various techniques on which existing regression testing approaches rely. Therefore, applying these approaches may lead to problems during maintenance and thus impair software quality.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this proposal is to create a novel regression testing framework that can be applied to real-world complex software systems, focusing on the hardware dependence and concurrent control characteristics, throughout their lifetimes. Specifically, this research will develop, evaluate, and make available a family of techniques and tools that can: 1) create comprehensive models of the whole system to analyze change impact across hardware and software layers and across concurrent events, 2) retest the systems accordingly using existing test cases, and 3) generate new test cases when needed. The analytical underpinnings of this research will be applicable not only to the software engineering community, but to industry and other disciplines in which software dependability plays an important role. The associated education agenda paves the way for teaching that cross traditional boundaries among multicore computing, embedded systems and software engineering, which may ultimately, through the dissemination of new curricular materials, have impacts to the broader scientific community."

Despite the recent development of new ceramic materials for fast conduction of lithium ions, these battery systems are not yet commercialized. A major outstanding problem is that the solid-state interfaces between the ion-conducting ceramics and other materials within the battery are unstable, which leads to poor battery lifetimes. To address this challenge, this research uses novel experimental techniques to understand interface degradation processes in real time and to determine how to protect these interfaces from degradation. This fundamental understanding is critical for the creation of reliable, long-lasting solid-state batteries. This work is being performed by both graduate and undergraduate students, who are being trained in the science of materials for energy applications. Furthermore, this research includes an educational initiative in which new high school curriculum is being developed in collaboration with a high school teacher. The curriculum is focused on integrating materials and energy sciences in ways that are relevant to high school students' daily lives. These new learning tools will better prepare high school students from underrepresented groups for careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: <br/>Interfacial transformations and instabilities at ceramic electrolyte interfaces in alkali metal-based solid-state batteries often cause increased impedance and reduced cycle life.

Multiple in situ experimental techniques are being used to probe nanoscale transformations at ceramic electrolyte/alkali metal interfaces before and during battery operation, and the influence of tailored protection layers on interfacial transformations are also being examined. By directly revealing nanoscale transformations at ceramic electrolyte interfaces for the first time, this research is helping to create the scientific foundation for stabilizing critical interfaces in next-generation solid-state batteries, thereby enabling superior new energy storage technologies."

The last 20 years have seen significant advancement in understanding of how to create effective learning environments for STEM education. While many individual faculty have adopted new approaches to teaching, change has not been deep or widespread enough to make a major impact across all of STEM education. Better understanding is needed of how faculty can become change agents in order to effect this change. This study focuses on exploring the experiences of early career engineering education faculty as they attempt to impact the engineering education experiences of students locally and more broadly. Engineering education faculty are unique in that they have formal training in the types of change desired, and are often embedded in disciplinary engineering departments where they can apply their knowledge to create change. Understanding their experiences and the academic cultures in which they are working will provide information on they can and cannot influence education practices in their departments. Doing so will enhance our efforts to train and develop faculty prepared to drive change in engineering education.<br/><br/>In the first phase of a two-phase study, collaborative inquiry and collaborative autoethnography methods will be used to systematically examine the PIs' own experiences as six early career faculty members in diverse settings: this will include scrutinizing acceptance of ambiguity, responses to disappointments and challenges, willingness to adapt, and ability to collaborate. Subsequently, in the second phase, the experiences of 12-15 additional early career faculty members will be examined to refine and expand on the phase one results, increasing their applicability to multiple settings. The results of this project will (1) advance the engineering education community's understanding of existing structures for facilitating change (or the lack thereof) in engineering education (2) identify barriers and supports for making change as early career engineering education faculty; and (3) develop a co-constructed understanding of how to better prepare and support faculty to exercise agency as it relates to impacting engineering education during their first few years in academic positions. These advancements are critical because the calls for change in engineering education will continue as technological advances are made and the role of engineers in society continues to evolve. By identifying the barriers and supports that affect early career faculty's abilities to take strategic and intentional actions towards achieving impact, the results of this study will enable engineering education graduate programs and national engineering education organizations to make programmatic changes to benefit future faculty. In addition, the evidence-based insights resulting from this study have the potential to expedite the on-boarding process of new engineering education faculty, promote improvements in STEM education nationally by faculty at all stages of their careers, and support the development of the field of engineering education research."

Grain boundaries are the interfaces between crystalline regions in metals and ceramics and they form a complex interconnected network that strongly influences many material properties including creep resistance, hydrogen embrittlement, photovoltaic efficiency, and radiation tolerance. The properties of individual grain boundaries can vary by orders of magnitude. If it were possible to engineer the structure of grain boundary networks, this enormous property variation could be leveraged to enhance both energy and structural materials. Inspired by spectral graph theory - which is the mathematics that powers Google's web search algorithm, and characterizes social, ecological and biological networks--the PI will develop the mathematical tools to characterize the structure of grain boundary networks, predict their aggregate properties, and address materials design with application tailored grain boundary network structures.<br/><br/>The PI will develop a social-network-based multiplayer materials design game, powered by this spectral graph theory framework to enhance science, technology, engineering, and mathematics curricula and harness the innate 3D spatial reasoning of students and the public to solve large-scale materials design problems.

By integrating materials research, social-networking, and active learning through game play, this project provides a transformative opportunity to expand US technological leadership and global competitiveness by broadening the reach of and increasing student engagement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and simultaneously enabling new dimensions of materials design to accelerate the discovery of new materials. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This CAREER award supports the integration of teaching and research to expand understanding and control of grain boundary networks in polycrystalline materials by: 1) developing a general descriptor for grain boundary network structure via spectral graph theory, and 2) leveraging this tool to invigorate science, technology, engineering and mathematics education and solve large-scale materials design problems using a social-network-based online game. This work will enable five fundamental advances: 1) a general framework to characterize the structure of grain boundary networks; 2) prediction of grain-boundary-sensitive properties; 3) design of microstructures with application tailored grain boundary networks; 4) prediction of processing routes for future synthesis of designed microstructures; 5) a human cloud computing platform for solving large-scale materials design problems and increasing student engagement in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. <br/><br/>Although grain boundary networks strongly influence material properties, the complexity of their coupled topological-crystallographic structure has hindered the development of quantitative structure-property models. If a mathematical description of grain boundary structure existed it would enable grain boundary network characterization, property prediction, and design/optimization for improved material performance. Spectral graph theory has been used to study complex networks in ecology, biology, and computer science. For example, the PageRank algorithm that powers Google's search engine uses spectral decomposition of the network structure of the World Wide Web to determine its dominant features and correlate these with query relevance. This work utilizes spectral decomposition of the network structure of materials to determine their dominant microstructural features and correlate these with material properties. The eigenvalues of the grain boundary network will provide a natural language for structure metrics that encode both topological and crystallographic information for grain boundary networks.<br/><br/>Using this spectral graph theory framework to characterize grain boundary network structure in 3D polycrystals, the PI will use computer simulation to address two objectives: (1) develop a model to predict the effective diffusivity of grain boundary networks in polycrystals; (2) create a constitutive model for anisotropic grain growth that can be inverted to predict processing paths and suggest routes to synthesize designed microstructures. The objective of the Teaching Plan is to increase engagement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education through the integration of social-networks, technology and games. A social-network-based multiplayer game will be developed that enhances science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education curricula and recruits the intellectual resources of students and the public to design materials. The research plan provides the enabling innovation to satisfy the computational requirements of the teaching plan, which reciprocates this integration by providing data on the heuristics used by humans to solve materials design problems, which will be analyzed to inform the construction of numerical optimization algorithms for materials design.<br/><br/>By developing and exploiting novel computational tools involving spectral graph theory, this work presents a transformational opportunity to expand our understanding of the structure, properties, and evolution of grain boundary networks. This work also presents an innovative social-network-based computational platform to solve large-scale materials design problems. It is anticipated that the results will have implications for diverse materials phenomena and wide ranging materials design applications."

By collecting data during its traversals of the environment, more detailed models can be learned, tested in simulation, and then used to make the robot's actions more reliable.

Synaptic changes are the basis for flexible information processing, learning, memory, and recovery from injury in the brain, but, since neural activity is highly variable, studying synaptic changes in behaving animals is a major challenge. The research described in this proposal will address this challenge by developing novel statistical methods that infer changes in synaptic strength based on neural spiking activity. In parallel with the research plan, this project will also implement a set of tutorials and workshops to improve the training of undergraduate and graduate students in neural data analysis. These resources aim to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroscience research and better prepare experimental neuroscientists to contribute to and benefit from large-scale data and code sharing.<br/><br/>The proposed research will develop a statistical model-based framework that allows time-varying synaptic weights to be inferred from spiking data alone and apply these methods to characterize plasticity on multiple timescales in vivo. Through close collaboration with experimentalists, the models will first be validated and refined on isolated, well studied neural systems with known connectivity. The models will then be extended to address the additional sources of variability in larger populations of neurons with unknown connectivity. This framework will be applied to determine 1) how synaptic plasticity interacts with brain state and 2) how short- and long-term plasticity interact in vivo. By using multi-electrode spike recordings, the statistical tools developed here will allow synaptic plasticity to be quantified on a larger scale than previously possible and will allow new comparisons of plasticity across cell types, brain areas, and behaviors. By shedding light on how synapses change over time, this work may ultimately lead to a better understanding of disease and injury and advance the development of neurally-inspired technologies.<br/>"

In many plants and animals, males and females exhibit many differences in form and physiology. These differences are thought to arise because qualities that are beneficial in one sex may be deleterious in the opposite sex. Although physical differences between males and females are very conspicuous, we have a poor understanding of the genetic mechanisms that generate these differences, and many of their benefits. In Ceratodon, female mosses produce scents to attract small insects that carry sperm from male plants, promoting reproduction, while male plants make few such scents. This research will test the idea that the production of these scents is costly in males, and that the genes for scent production are present but turned off in males. In addition, the project will involve mentoring both undergraduate and high school students, including individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>The project will use quantitative genetics and transcriptomic experiments to understand the evolutionary forces shaping sexually dimorphic scent profiles. Scents are comprised of a cocktail of volatile organic compunds (VOC). Measures of VOC production in a pedigreed population is providing an estimate of the additive genetic variance and covariance for VOC production in males and females. Competitive mating trials will be used to evaluate the fitness consequences of variation in VOC production in males and females, both in the presence and absence of sperm-dispersing arthropods.

As the largest state economy in the United States, the health of California is important to the health of the United States. <br/> <br/>This proposal's goal is to investigate California's precipitation history as related to the position and strength of its North-South antiphased precipitation regime over the past 3000 years. To accomplish this goal, tubes of mud will be extracted from three lakes. Like a history book, these tubes of mud record California's precipitation history. The team will study the mud's physical, chemical, and biological properties to infer a history of floods, droughts, vegetation change, and fire activity. Training of students from groups historically underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math is a key component of this study."

These remaining grasslands play important roles in the cycling of carbon and nutrients, biodiversity, and as sources for restoration. The health and seasonal dynamics of the remaining native grasslands in the central US are controlled by the amount and timing of rainfall. Across the central US rainfall variability is predicted to increase, with greater frequencies of extreme wet and dry years expected. Grasslands are likely to be particularly sensitive to such changes, with evidence that these systems may be more sensitive to wet versus dry years. However, studies rarely include assessment of extreme years. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) award, will experimentally assess the sensitivity of the grassland composition, carbon cycle, and nutrient cycling to rainfall extremes within an intact semi-arid grassland system. The research results will be valuable to natural resource and land managers in managing or restoring native grasslands. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and participate in the research. <br/><br/>This research project aims to advance a fundamental understanding of how ecosystems will respond to predicted increases in environmental variability and extremity. The grassland ecosystem's response to rainfall extremes is hypothesized to be non-linear and bi-modal. A novel experimental treatment is proposed to expose semi-arid grassland to a large gradient of growing season precipitation that will be able to detect nonlinearities in response variables that are otherwise not detectable in few-factor experimental design. The research will allow assessment of the comparative sensitivities of key carbon cycle components to dry versus wet years, and how this sensitivity may change when precipitation transitions from moderate to extreme deviations from mean levels."

Political borders between nation-states are often barriers for the movement of people, but they also create spaces of opportunity for various economic activities. People may strategically utilize borders to take advantage of factors such as different tax rates, labor costs, and employment prospects.  However, international borders do not all function in the same way. Some,  such as borders within the European Union, promote cross-border flow. Others, such as the U.S.-Mexico border, reinforce divisions. Emory University doctoral student Daniel K. Thompson, supervised by Dr. Peter D. Little, will address the question of the effects of this variaibility in a regional economy where global migration and finance circuits intersect with local cross-border flows.  Combining in-depth interviews with business statistics, the results from this project will inform social scientists and policymakers about the impacts of transnational investment in regions characterized by both poverty and transnational interconnectivity.  Through collaboration with students and researchers at Jigjiga University, the project will also help build research capacity at a new university.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted in Jigjiga, a key trading town in eastern Ethiopia near the Ethiopia-Somalia border that historically has provided a transit point for trade between Ethiopia's highlands and the coast of Somalia. In the past decade, Jigjiga has become a site for a new type of international business as hundreds of ethnic Somalis from the diaspora, especially from Europe and North America, have returned and started businesses in town. The researcher will compare business strategies, competition, and opportunity among three groups of business people: (1) town-based retailers; (2) merchants who specialize in cross-border commerce with Somalia and have longstanding cross-border relationships; and (3) returned diaspora investors, whose ties extend far beyond the region. Data will be collected through participant observation, informant mapping tasks, in-depth interviews with 90 business owners and managers from the three groups, and a social and business network survey to map out their local, regional, and transnational financial and social networks. These data will allow comparisons among the three groups to determine how they impact the regional economy and economic opportunities, and how extensive circuits of trade and finance are grounded in the borderlands city."

How do people put such complex information together so quickly over the course of an utterance?  Sociolinguists have begun recently to study moment-to-moment reactions to each individual meaningful instance of variation. Efforts have been hampered, however, by a lack of methodological consistency and an inadequate theoretical understanding of the relationship between such moment-to-moment reactions and the end-of-stimulus judgments on which most work on sociolinguistic perception is based. Research on people's perceptions of positive and negative experiences suggests that this relationship is likely to be more complex that sociolinguists have assumed.<br/><br/>The first phase of the project will test possible methods for tracking sociolinguistic perception moment-to-moment, including both explicit methods such as button presses and implicit methods such as eye-tracking. These will be tested on the same stimuli, which will be constructed to include specific linguistic differences, to identify the methods which are best at detecting these known differences. The successful methods will be used in the second phase to explore how listeners respond to multiple tokens of the same variable, to tokens of different but socially related variables and to variables combined with extra-linguistic information like pictures of the speaker. Finally, phase three will use the, by now, well-tested stimuli to explore the effects of important points in sociolinguistic perception on linguistic processing. The research will be conducted at the Ohio State University's Language Science Research Lab, which is embedded in the science museum COSI, inviting museum visitors to participate in the research.

The weapons, stone point tips attached to spears and called ""Clovis points"" by archaeologists, were flintknapped into specimens with parallel to slightly convex sides, a concave base, and flake-removal scars; termed ""flutes."" These flutes occur on one or both faces and on average extend from the base to about a third of the way to the tip.

This project examines the way organisms colonize and adapt to extreme environments, namely freshwater caves. Caves are hostile habitats where adaptation at the genetic level is essential for survival. Cave organisms commonly have a special set of traits collectively known as 'troglomorphy,' which include changes in both form (reduced dependence on eyes, longer legs and antennae) and function (tolerance to low oxygen, better sense of smell). These traits in combination with the geographical isolation of caves make them a perfect study system to answer long-standing questions on adaptation, and species diversification. This project uses genetic methods to study the geographic distribution of two crustacean species (Asellus aquaticus and Niphargus hrabei), which have populations that can be found in surface waters and freshwater caves throughout Europe. In order to better understand how these species colonized and adapted to life in darkness, this project will identify the important genes that play a role in troglomorphy, and examine how they are controlled (switched on or off). The identification of genes that are switched on or off when exposed to different conditions (surface vs. caves) will help to clarify how genetics and environment ultimately come together to drive the form and function of living organisms. Additionally, cave ecosystems often contain rare, or new, species that are left undiscovered due to the difficultly of accessing and studying these habitats.  Unfortunately, many cave species are endangered (pollution, habitat destruction, overexploitation of aquifers, etc.), and the opportunity to gain knowledge from these ideal study systems is quickly vanishing. In addition to the scientific knowledge generated during this project, it will also result in the training of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art molecular laboratory techniques and computational analyses. The computer software developed for these analyses will be made available online, providing other researchers with the opportunity to use these new resources. Exploration of these caves will likely result in the discovery and description of new species. Photo and video footage gathered during these expeditions will be made public as a documentary highlighting cave exploration and research. Results from this project will be offered in a series of public seminars and outreach activities. Impacts from this research will aid in the understanding of these important but very threatened ecosystems and will help us better understand conservation needs for the organisms in these systems.<br/><br/>	The unique characteristics of aquatic caves and of their predominantly crustacean biodiversity nominate them as particularly interesting study subjects for evolutionary biologists. The present study capitalizes on a perfect natural experiment, the Molnar Janos thermal cave system in Budapest, Hungary. This intricate freshwater cave system and the immediately adjacent Malom Lake present the ideal opportunity to address questions of colonization, adaptation, and evolution. Despite marked environmental differences between the cave and surface waters, both localities are inhabited by natural populations of two emerging model cave species, the isopod Asellus aquaticus and the amphipod Niphargus hrabei. This project aims to employ these populations' phylogeographic histories as robust frameworks on which to evaluate the transcriptional and epigenetic basis behind the adaptive divergence of traits involved in troglomorphy, namely vision and chemoreception. This investigation will be undertaken using comparative DNA methylation (BsRADseq) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) approaches. The identification and evaluation of differentially expressed/methylated genes and pathways will provide a solid bridge between genotype-phenotype, and aid in the understanding of patterns of molecular evolution in cave systems. The results will depict, in a phylogenetically informed context, a close to complete picture of the molecular basis behind vision and chemoreception in A. aquaticus and N. hrabei, of the role these traits play in cave adaptation, and of the evolution of troglomorphy in the subphylum Crustacea. With these, the present study will contribute to the discovery of evolutionarily significant molecular mechanisms that permit the survival and evolution of life in caves and other extreme environments. These findings will undoubtedly yield valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of adaptation and their role in evolutionary processes across environments and across the tree of life."

For example, Glenn Brier argued in 1950 that the way meteorologists were evaluated would actually give them an incentive to distort the true probability of rain.  Brier's study inspired a growing body of work in statistics, economics, and now computer science, which studies evaluation metrics that incentivize accurate reports from people or machines.  These evaluation metrics are also used in machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, where a designer implicitly tells the computer what statistic to predict by providing only the evaluation metric itself.  This project seeks to mathematically characterize this link between statistics and evaluation metrics, and moreover, to understand the computational and statistical difficulty of evaluating different statistics.  A precise understanding of this link would provide new evaluation metrics with the potential to increase predictive power across a vast array of applications such as climate simulations and smart cities.  In particular, metrics for statistics that quantify uncertainty or risk could improve decision making in many fields, including healthcare, engineering, and finance.<br/><br/>A dominant algorithmic paradigm in machine learning, encompassing most regression techniques and classification algorithms, is that of empirical risk minimization (ERM): choosing a model from some class that best fits the data, according to some evaluation metric called a loss function.  A thread of research in theoretical machine learning called property elicitation gives a mathematical formalism to describe the link between loss functions and their corresponding statistics.  In these terms, this project seeks to characterize the statistics which have calibrated loss functions, and determine how many regression parameters or data points are required for the calibration to hold.  These questions are particularly relevant to machine learning when restricting attention to certain classes of loss functions which can be easily optimized or which have desirable statistical learning guarantees.  The class of statistics from mathematical finance known as risk measures, which are used to regulate banks, form an important focus of the project."

A classic example is that, while rubber (as e.g. in an eraser) has extremely poor wear resistance, the addition of silica nanoparticles causes the wear resistance to go up so much that a car can drive with tires that last over 50,000 miles.  While such property improvements are what drive developments in the field of polymer nanocomposites, the inherent problem is that the nanoparticles are chemically so different from the polymer (a hydrocarbon material) and thus have a strong tendency to separate from each other akin to a water-oil suspension. Thus, the desirable, favorable property improvements that can only be realized by the intimate mixing of the polymer and the NPs become hard to realize on a routine basis. The work here proposes to remedy this problem by chemically grafting polymer chains onto the NPs so that the inorganic particle surface can be ""shielded"" from the polymer, thus allowing miscibility to be obtained. In particular, the work focuses on two strategies for this grafting: either grafting fully formed chains to the surfaces, or growing the chains piece-by-piece from the surface. Which of these strategies allows better control over particle-polymer miscibility and therefore improve properties the most is the focus of this research.  In addition to this technical emphasis, the proposed work will also stress the broad, interdisciplinary education of students and the recruitment and retention of women and minority students into STEM programs by attracting high-school and undergraduate students into engineering research activities in the PI's laboratory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>The focus of this proposal is on the self-assembly of polymer-grafted nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer matrix with the goal of impacting the behavior of the resulting hybrid (or composite) material. This physical situation has relevance to improved performance in, for example, rubber tires and epoxies (which are used in electronic packaging and computer chip applications). This underpinning question will be studied through the exploration of three test-beds by judiciously combining theory and experiments. In particular, emphasis will be placed on role of the mechanism by which chains are grafted onto NP surfaces on the final material properties, i.e., whether the chains are preformed and attached to the surface or if the chains are grown link-by-link from the surface. It is expected that the former mechanism will yield a more uniform polymer coverage on the NP surface. The consequence of these differences in surface coverage on the assemblies formed and the resulting properties is the ultimate focus of this work. These research activities are coupled to extensive education and outreach activities. A major focus will be to recruit underrepresented students (both women and minorities) at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  It is planned to grow both the current summer high-school research program, and also the research-experiences-for-undergraduates program during the schoolyear, with the goal of recruiting (and hopefully retaining) women and minorities into STEM efforts."

Each student is supervised by a faculty mentor, and the program structure provides opportunities for cross-collaboration with students and faculty in other research groups in the department and across the university. Students work daily on their research projects; attend weekly research seminars; participate in professional development workshops and outreach events; and deliver research presentations. Interactions with professional industrial chemists, including site visits to companies and seminars, give students career information and inspiration. Formative and summative assessment is conducted, and students' careers are tracked during and after their participation. The goal is to help, inspire, and retain undergraduate students in scientific careers by providing them with a strong educational, mentoring, and research training experiences.<br/><br/>Many of the leading global scientific challenges require a deeper understanding of both biological and chemical catalysis, and the subsequent or parallel ability to evolve new and better catalysts for an increasing demand for clean, renewable and sustainable energy, food, clean air, pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tools for healthcare, and consumer products and other necessities.

The last 20 years have seen significant advancement in understanding of how to create effective learning environments for STEM education. While many individual faculty have adopted new approaches to teaching, change has not been deep or widespread enough to make a major impact across all of STEM education. Better understanding is needed of how faculty can become change agents in order to effect this change. This study focuses on exploring the experiences of early career engineering education faculty as they attempt to impact the engineering education experiences of students locally and more broadly. Engineering education faculty are unique in that they have formal training in the types of change desired, and are often embedded in disciplinary engineering departments where they can apply their knowledge to create change. Understanding their experiences and the academic cultures in which they are working will provide information on they can and cannot influence education practices in their departments. Doing so will enhance our efforts to train and develop faculty prepared to drive change in engineering education.<br/><br/>In the first phase of a two-phase study, collaborative inquiry and collaborative autoethnography methods will be used to systematically examine the PIs' own experiences as six early career faculty members in diverse settings: this will include scrutinizing acceptance of ambiguity, responses to disappointments and challenges, willingness to adapt, and ability to collaborate. Subsequently, in the second phase, the experiences of 12-15 additional early career faculty members will be examined to refine and expand on the phase one results, increasing their applicability to multiple settings. The results of this project will (1) advance the engineering education community's understanding of existing structures for facilitating change (or the lack thereof) in engineering education (2) identify barriers and supports for making change as early career engineering education faculty; and (3) develop a co-constructed understanding of how to better prepare and support faculty to exercise agency as it relates to impacting engineering education during their first few years in academic positions. These advancements are critical because the calls for change in engineering education will continue as technological advances are made and the role of engineers in society continues to evolve. By identifying the barriers and supports that affect early career faculty's abilities to take strategic and intentional actions towards achieving impact, the results of this study will enable engineering education graduate programs and national engineering education organizations to make programmatic changes to benefit future faculty. In addition, the evidence-based insights resulting from this study have the potential to expedite the on-boarding process of new engineering education faculty, promote improvements in STEM education nationally by faculty at all stages of their careers, and support the development of the field of engineering education research."

It is highly specialized for this environment using a gas-filled float as a sail to catch the wind and long tentacles as fishing line to capture small fishes and crustaceans. Physalia physalis is known to many beach goers for its painful sting, but despite being familiar and abundant, little is known about most basic features of this species. In this project, researchers will use new microscopy techniques to answer old questions about the anatomy, development, and evolutionary origins of this unique species. The products of this study will be made freely accessible to the public and other scientists via open access publishing. The award will also support lessons in a local elementary school on topics related to this project, including lessons on ocean zones, plankton, pleuston, and marine invertebrate body plans.<br/><br/>Physalia physalis is the only siphonophore (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) that is pleustonic (living at the interface between water and air). Siphonophores are colonial animals that are composed of zooids (bodies) that are each homologous to solitary animals. This project will describe fundamental features of P. physalis morphology and use phylogenetic comparative methods to reconstruct the evolutionary changes associated with a transition from a planktonic to pleustonic lifestyle. The primary product of this work will be a re-description of P. physalis, which also aims to address some of the following questions: how are zooids organized in P. physalis? How does P. physalis zooid morphology and colony organization differ from other siphonophore species, and what does this suggest about their evolution? Physalia physalis colonies have highly 3-dimensional branching structures. Optical Projection Tomography, as well as other immuno-fluorescent imaging methods, will be used to 3D-image fixed P. physalis tissue. These morphological descriptions will be compared with morphological descriptions available for planktonic siphonophores in order to investigate general patterns of character evolution within the siphonophore phylogeny."

Throughout the history of the modern engineering profession, small groups of engineers have fought for social justice issues. These engineers took on the roles of activist, reformer, or advocate as they struggled to steer the direction of their profession. In contrast to their peers - the majority of the leaders and members of the profession - these champions of social justice causes were ""dissenters"". They challenged the status quo of engineering practice. Today, more engineering students and young professionals enter the field with a concern for social justice. Yet many graduate into the ranks of a profession that is not as politically engaged as they hoped. This project is motivated by the desire of a growing number of engineers to see their profession more deeply engaged in social justice work. The investigators aim to strengthen the role of social justice in engineering by, (a) mapping the evolution of social justice in the culture of the profession, and then (b) sharing the findings (of effective channels of advocacy) with engineering student groups and professional member societies.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to study political engagement around social justice issues by a vanguard of engineers and to investigate how their dissent - be it expressed as activism, advocacy, protest, or reform - shapes the culture of their profession. The project engages theories of professions and social movements along with organizational theory to investigate (a) the mechanisms through which the engineering profession institutionalizes (or marginalizes) political engagement around social justice issues; and (b) ways the discourse of dissent are mobilized in bringing political consciousness around social justice issues to the engineering profession. These questions will be addressed using a holistic methodology for studying professional culture that comprises: quantitative and qualitative analysis of vanguard and mainstream discourses around social justice work, by analyzing informal and formal texts, in traditional and social media; in-depth, ethnographic observations of professional events where the socialization of engineers makes visible the role of practices and discourses of dissent in professional culture formation; and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with engineering dissenters - whether they occupy roles of activist, reformer, vanguard, or other positions of political protest. The results of this research and the dissemination of its findings will make visible the myriad forms of engineering dissent with the aim of bringing social justice into the mainstream of the profession."

Flexibility could facilitate evolution by creating new traits on which selection could act; alternatively, flexibility could hamper evolution by protecting genes for detrimental traits from being selected. Flexibility in mating behavior can be especially important because it could allow the maintenance of small or isolated populations, where available mates of preferred types are few, or play a role in the divergence of populations, ultimately leading to divergence of one species into two or more. This project addresses this fundamental question by examining how flexibility in mate preference could affect the evolution of courtship. During this project, a graduate student and an undergraduate participant will gain comprehensive research experience in behavioral ecology and bioacoustics. In addition, the researchers will engage in science education and outreach activities aimed at elementary school children, adults in non-science careers, and members of underrepresented groups in science via hands-on science activities, public appearances, and writing for non-technical audiences.<br/><br/>This project examines how the experience of male song quality during development affects female mating behavior in the Pacific field cricket. Male crickets produce song that females use to identify and localize appropriate mates. Within Hawaii, the crickets experience a novel selection pressure against singing preferred songs: an acoustically orienting parasitoid fly that preferentially infests males with the same song characteristics preferred by female crickets. Recently, a mutation arose that makes male crickets obligately silent ('flatwing'). Female crickets strongly prefer singing males, and also have directional preferences about temporal properties of the song. Plasticity in expression of these preferences could facilitate maintenance of this population when available males of preferred phenotypes are few, but this plasticity could have consequences for the strength of selection on sexual signals. Indeed, both males and females reared in silence, mimicking an all-mutant environment, become more phonotactic, suggesting that mating behavior is plastic and selection on signals in nature may be relaxed. In this study, the researchers will rear crickets in acoustic environments that vary by the value of a preferred trait and use phonotaxis trials (females) and song recordings (males) to determine: 1) whether signal production is plastic; 2) whether expression of female mating preferences is plastic; 3) whether population differences in the extent of this plasticity support the hypothesis that plasticity in mating behavior is an adaptive response following the introduction of flatwing."

Reductions in soil evaporation rates will lower irrigation demands and overall water consumption for crop production, thereby conserving water worldwide and in the Ogallala Aquifer in the Great Plains. This research project will understand the effects of hydrophobic soil (where water beads up) on evaporation compared to typically hydrophilic soil (where water spreads out) through laboratory studies. Glass beads will be coated to make them hydrophobic and these beads will be used to simulate soil. Evaporation will be studied from a few beads and a tray of beads under weather conditions similar to fields. Next, a type of soil called Ottawa sand will be coated to become hydrophobic and evaporation will be measured from the plain, hydrophilic sand and hydrophobic sand. These experiments will show how soil hydrophobicity affects evaporation from soil. Soil hydrophobicity can occur naturally due to minerals, organic materials, or waxes. Information from these laboratory evaporation studies will be used to determine best agricultural practices to reduce water losses since the Ogallala Aquifer provides water for over 20% of corn, wheat, sorghum, and cattle produced in the United States. Additionally, this research project will attract diverse students due to the importance of the research. The Principal Investigator (PI) and student researchers will use bread baking as an analogy for soil evaporation with groups of female High School students at the EXCITE workshop at Kansas State University (KSU) and the PI and researchers will showcase the research to first year, female undergraduate students at an annual Research Open House. The PI will also teach an interdisciplinary course on heat and mass transfer in the Food, Energy, and Water nexus to graduate students from multiple colleges at KSU.<br/><br/>This research will investigate transient evaporative phase change in a three-phase (i.e., soil, water, and air) system. The objectives of this study are to understand the impacts of hydrophobicity on evaporation mechanisms including contact line dynamics, capillary transport, and enhanced water vapor diffusion. Glass and Teflon-coated beads will be used to simulate soil for pore-level experiments. Evaporation will be modeled and experimentally investigated using a high speed and IR camera for a range of surface temperatures and realistic environmental conditions (e.g., air temperature and relative humidity and simulated solar irradiation). Contact lines will be observed for water evaporating from hydrophilic or hydrophobic single pores. Using knowledge obtained from these single pore studies, evaporation fronts and mechanisms such as capillary transport and enhanced water vapor diffusion will be investigated for multiple pores; water will be dyed with fluorescent dye rhodamine B and excited using a Nd:YAG laser. Color shifts will be used to identify evaporation fronts and liquid capillary transport for a given cross section of the porous material. In the final phase of the research, evaporation will be studied from layers of naturally hydrophilic and artificially hydrophobized Ottawa sand to understand the impacts of hydrophobicity on capillary transport and enhanced water vapor diffusion. This study will numerically and experimentally assess the relative impacts of hydrophobicity on these three primary evaporation mechanisms (i.e., contact line dynamics, capillary transport, and enhanced water vapor diffusion) and create a mechanistic map to show the dominant evaporation mechanism for field environmental conditions. As a result, the improved understanding of hydrophobicity on soil evaporation can inform agricultural best practices."

The Burgess Shale type fossils were preserved after one of the largest and earliest diversification events known in the history of life, the Cambrian Explosion (about 540 million years ago). This project will use micro-scale analyses of fossils, chemical signals preserved in sediments, and laboratory-based decay experiments to provide a better understanding of how Burgess Shale-type fossils form, and to understand the biology of some of our earliest animal ancestors. A key component of this work will be the development of an early animal life education plan designed to reach across the STEM pipeline. It will include components for elementary education, promotion of science to the general public, and contributions to geoscience education at the undergraduate level, the latter of which will continue to shape future generations of early STEM learners beyond the duration of this award.  <br/><br/>Each case of soft-tissue fossilization can be viewed as a race between destructive decay and constructive mineralization processes. By utilizing laboratory-based decay experimentation in concert with traditional field- and fossil-based approaches, this CAREER award research will provide necessary constraints on the timing and progression of decay-induced loss of biological information and fossilization-imperative mineralization within differing hypothesized (and observed) conditions for the Burgess Shale-type window. In addition to tried-and-true sedimentological, geochemical, and taphonomic approaches, this CAREER award research will utilize a custom-designed scanning electron microscope (supported by NSF EAR IF grant #1636643 to PI Schiffbauer) for significant improvements in fossil and decay-experiment-product microchemistry. Specifically, this instrument has been configured with dual, co-planar energy dispersive spectrometers and a microspot X-ray fluorescence system, coupled with several high-definition imaging detectors, to provide unparalleled fully quantitative and shadow-free microchemical analyses of a wide array of sample types. Fossil analyses and sedimentary geochemistry will focus on four North American, Paleozoic, Burgess Shale-type soft-tissue fossil deposits, which will better frame first-order fossilization processes and paleoenvironmental contexts that may have facilitated this taphonomic expression. This end goal of this study is to provide a refined understanding of how Burgess Shale-type preservation occurs, which in turn will deliver improved comprehension of biological fidelity of the fossil organisms preserved and contribute to a clearer picture of the earliest stages of animal evolution."

Marginal urban spaces, such as highway underpasses, urban forests, and abandoned lots, increasingly are co-inhabited by distinct marginal groups who may differ in language, religion, culture, and history. The goal is to understand what transpires in these spaces, how the people who inhabit them relate to each other, how they relate to the rest of society, how the comings and goings of different groups may affect all of those relationships, and what these processes may reveal about marginality more broadly. The conjunction of social and geographic marginality is an increasingly visible global phenomenon but many aspects of its social dimensions remain unknown. Do the people in these spaces see themselves as marginal? Does co-habitation produce solidarity or competition? When new groups come in does that change opportunities and experiences of older, more established groups? Is this phenomenon best described as social segregation or hiding? In response to these and other unknowns, the fundamental concern of this research is to develop a general theory of how spatial and social marginality intersect wherever they co-occur. <br/><br/>The research will be conducted by University of Vermont anthropologist Dr. Jonah A. Steinberg, who will employ the case study method, alongside a range of techniques of detailed spatial analysis and mapping. He has chosen to conduct the research in the industrial conurbation of Marseille, France, where a long-present pariah group, mobile Roma (sometimes erroneously called ""Gypsies"") from Danube and Balkan territory in Eastern Europe, are now overlapping extensively with Muslim refugees, in particular from Syria and Afghanistan. This is an appropriate site because it presents a convergence of forces that occur independently elsewhere: a large influx of migrants, attacks by members of transnational political movements, and ascendant nationalisms. He will focus his detailed spatial observations on four hyperdiverse zones of the city with high levels of intercultural contact, incorporating several marketplaces and sites of informal housing. Through participant observation, surveys, interviews, and archival research, with a focus on differentiating consistent inhabitants and shorter-term residents, he will collect data on both people and space, exploring through microspatial analytical methods precisely how individuals and families from multiple groups interact in urban marginal zones over variable scales of time. These data will be complemented with ""life cartographies,"" map-like descriptions of trajectories through space over time elicited from individuals.

A delicate thermodynamic balance governs the lowest degree of polymerization (N) at which an AB diblock polymer microphase separates, which then dictates the smallest microdomain size that can form. One potential block polymer application relies on their periodic microdomains as templates for advanced microelectronics and mesoporous inorganic materials with sub-15 nm features. A common approach to reducing diblock polymer domain sizes is to decrease N, while increasing the chemical incompatibility of the A and B segments. However, applications of these new materials often require costly development of new materials processing protocols. This project investigates the microphase separation behavior of Janus bottlebrush polymers, a nonlinear polymer architecture derived from covalently linking linear AB diblocks through their junctions, as a new means for driving AB diblocks to self-assemble at smaller length scales than their linear homologs. Using a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and rheological measurements, the phase behaviors of Janus bottlebrushes will be studied as a function of their compositions, the chemical incompatibility between the homopolymer arms, and the graft density of the bristles along the backbone."

However, the expected positive impact from increasing the number of engineering graduates will be limited, unless the full capabilities of these graduates are harnessed. Specifically, solving today's complex challenges will require cooperation among experts from many fields. In order for these collaborations to be successful they must harness the diverse capabilities of members of these groups. For that to happen, practicing engineers must exercise technical leadership. Therefore, undergraduate engineering students need to learn how to be effective leaders during their formation as engineers. Unfortunately, engineering educators do not currently have sufficient understanding of how engineering students develop into leaders. This project seeks to improve our understanding of the role leadership plays in the process of becoming an engineer and how to develop an engineering identity in undergraduate engineering students. The project proposes that seeing oneself as an engineering leader requires both the development of an engineering identity in combination with the development of a leadership identity. This project investigates the process of becoming an engineering leader given the central role identity plays in learning.  By understanding the relationship between a leadership identity and an engineering identity, this work will provide a foundation for improving the leadership skills of undergraduate engineers during their time in college using cross-ethnic notions of leadership to serve a diverse student body.<br/><br/>Current approaches in engineering education to develop leadership skills in engineers do little to understand how leadership fits into the broader picture of the heterogeneous nature of engineering work, or the role leadership plays in the formation of an engineering identity. This project seeks to address this gap through a sequential, mixed-methods study resulting in development of a grounded theory of engineering leadership for undergraduate engineering students. The study will answer three research questions: 1) How does leadership identity in engineering students compare to those in other fields? 2) What is the relationship between leadership identity and engineering identity? 3) How do engineering undergraduates define engineering leadership and develop a sense of engineering leadership identity?  This work recognizes that formation of engineers is fundamentally an identity development process. This project combines two models: Lave and Wenger's communities of practice model to understand development of an engineering identity and Komives, et al.'s Leadership Identity Model to understanding how engineering students cultivate a self-concept as a leader. Using these two models, this project seeks to understand how the separate components of engineering and leadership identity converge in the development of a combined engineering leadership identity among undergraduate students. Informed by an analysis of national data, a grounded theory approach will lead to an explanatory model of engineering leadership identity development. As an initial application of the model a series of educational interventions will developed and tested, enabling engineering educators to more effectively train engineering students in leadership."

If scientists could predict where or when pests would be worst, it could prevent financial losses. This project will provide direct insight into the specific role of the environment (climate, summer length, etc.) on pest pressure. The researchers will address this question in a wild plant species rather than a crop species. This is because pesticides and agricultural practices hide the influence of natural factors. The focal species in this study is pokeweed (and associated pests). Pokeweed is a culturally significant perennial plant native to the eastern USA. Prior research has shown that pokeweed is heavily eaten by caterpillars in the southern vs. northern US. This proposal checks if pokeweed's defenses against insects are stronger in the South. That pattern would suggest that the plants in the South have adapted to a long history of stronger pest pressure. In addition, the research will answer basic questions about how the environment influences relationships between plants and insects. It will also help to address the long-standing mystery of why ecosystems closer to the equator have more species than ecosystems at higher latitudes. The project will also enhance K-12 education through the creation of videos on latitudinal diversity for distribution to teachers.<br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that plants are better chemically defended at lower latitudes. The researchers will use a generalist caterpillar (Spodoptera exigua) to bioassay defense, and correlate caterpillar performance with leaf traits. Preliminary trials show that mortality is greater for S. exigua raised on a diet of pokeweed leaves from lower vs. higher latitude plants, suggesting that low-latitude plants are better defended. Lower latitude leaves are tougher, so to disentangle mechanical and chemical defense traits, ground leaves will be incorporated into agar for bioassays that test the effects of chemical defenses only. Liquid and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry will characterize leaf chemistry profiles, and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen will serve as an index of leaf nutritional value. In sum, the project asks which leaf traits predict caterpillar performance over a latitudinal gradient, advancing our understanding of geographic variation in plant defense and addressing recent controversy about the generality of stronger biotic interactions at lower latitudes."

The National Science Foundation's CAREER program supports junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research. This CAREER project dissects and characterizes science explanations in formal and informal learning settings to uncover best practices for optimizing explanations. Developing optimal practices for how adults use explanations in science learning has potential to improve the efficiency of knowledge transfer to the next generation of science learners. For example, in science learning it is often accepted that children learn best when they acquire information from first-hand experience. However, many times, at both home and school, first-hand information is not available. In these cases, students rely on an explanation given to them by a caregiver or teacher. How adults choose to provide explanations can vary dramatically, and aspects of the explanation itself can drive variability in future learning. Yet, it is unclear how various aspects of an explanation can be optimized to enhance science learning. <br/><br/>The project employs a three-pronged approach that includes (1) observations of questions and explanations in adult-child interaction in an inquiry-based preschool, (2) systematic experiments in both laboratory and museum settings to explore how various aspects of an explanation impact children's learning, and (3) an intervention designed to promote scientific thinking in parent-child dyads in a museum setting. The results from this project will provide insight into how children use adult explanations in science inquiry. The work will also produce generalizable insights, distributed widely, into how to leverage adult explanations to encourage STEM learning. In doing so, the project addresses the need to develop innovative strategies for inspiring STEM inquiry before children enter formal schooling. More generally, insight into how explanations are used in inquiry-based learning will have broad impact for guidelines on how to teach science in formal and informal learning environments. Integrated with this research are several educational activities designed to promote broader public awareness of social interaction in children's STEM learning. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program which funds basic research that seeks to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation."

Such changes in forests are often attributed to changes in fire occurrence and frequency, but analyses of tree rings suggest other environmental changes such as rising CO2 and changes in weather patterns that may have contributed to shifts in forests and savannas. In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) award funds will be used to measure tree ring carbon stable isotopes to estimate annual trends in water use efficiency across a network of savanna and forest sites to determine the mechanism for changes in tree growth and the trends observed in historical survey and ring-width data. A better understanding of the many factors responsible for changing forest cover in the past will help in understanding how anticipated future environmental changes might affect Midwestern forests: Hotter temperatures and drought stress could drive tree decline, pushing today's forests towards the savanna state. Alternatively, increases in CO2 may confer drought resilience by enhancing tree growth, and favoring forest expansion. These alternative trajectories for the Midwest create uncertainty in predicting future vegetation distribution and make it difficult for local land and forest managers to develop effective resource management plans.  <br/><br/>The award funds will be used to test the hypothesis that increased atmospheric CO2 has driven past changes in tree growth and altered forest resilience to future changes. This research advances scientific understanding of how environmental changes affect Midwestern forest resilience and growth, and more broadly identifies the conditions where tree growth is resilient to environmental changes. This award builds on a network of sites where the researchers have developed annual tree ring growth records from 1850-2015 for oak trees in both closed forest and open savannas.  From the annual trends in tree ring growth across these sites, the researchers have identified places where tree growth has increased since 1950 and where the growth-climate relationships change over time. Such shifts are consistent with CO2 driven enhancement of tree water use efficiency (carbon uptake by the tree per unit of water needed), which can theoretically drive increases in tree growth and improve drought tolerance in trees.  However, growth data alone cannot determine if CO2 fertilization is the mechanism for these changes. Thus, researchers will use stable carbon isotopes in tree rings, which are related to water use efficiency, to determine the extent to which rising CO2 can explain changes in tree growth. Overall, this project will test whether CO2 enhancement played a role in stabilizing trends in Midwest forest cover, and will provide scientific insight into the conditions necessary for CO2 enhancement of tree growth."

The smallest unit of the crystal, the unit cell, repeats itself in straight lines across three dimensions to grow these stunning objects.  But what if the available space for the crystals to form is non-flat, i.e. curved?  How could the unit cells be accommodated and how will the structure be distorted?  The molecules have to make turns as they pack into the crystalline lattice, and the shape and properties of the resultant crystals will vary. This project is concerned with such a scenario, and aims to understand the fundamentals on how polymer crystals are formed in a very small and curved space.  The PI has recently shown that hollow crystal capsules can be formed by crystallizing polymers on the surface of liquid droplets. These unique capsules are termed ""crystalsomes"". In this project, crystallization from solution will be conducted in small liquid droplets. Crystallization conditions and the molecular structure of the polymers will be systematically varied to control the shape and size of the crystalsomes, whose structure will be studied using a number of advanced instrumental techniques.  It is anticipated that well-controlled crystalsomes may find applications in the fields of nanomotors, drug delivery and gene therapeutics. The educational component of the proposal includes: (1) Developing two class modules which will be used in an Advanced Polymer Characterization course; (2) Mentoring graduate and undergraduate students; (3) Involving high school students and teachers, particularly from under-represented populations, in the proposed research activities; and (4) Engaging in local outreach activities to enhance broader interest in science and technology.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>Crystallization is a ubiquitous self-assembly process in nature. By definition, crystallization implies that a unit cell self-repeats in a three-dimensional (3D) lattice following translational symmetry. A curved space, on the other hand, is intrinsically incommensurate with 3D translational symmetry. Recently, the PI's group observed a unique type of crystalline morphology in a miniemulsion system. Polymer crystallization was found to be confined within and directed by the curved liquid/liquid interface.  Polymer single crystal-like capsules were obtained and the structure mimics the familiar polymersomes. The term ""crystalsome"" was coined to describe this unique structure, and the goal of the proposed work is to systematically investigate the structure and crystallization behavior of these peculiar crystalsomes. The specific aims of the proposal are to understand 1) the single-crystal growth mechanism in miniemulsion-solution crystallization systems, and 2) the crystal structure and chain packing in these curved crystalsomes. In this project, a variety of tailor-designed crystalsomes will be fabricated using the novel miniemulsion solution crystallization method. The crystalline morphology and structure of these crystalsomes will be systematically investigated using X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, electron microscopy, and scanning probe microscopy.  It is anticipated that this project will lead to clearer understanding of the mechanism of polymer crystallization at nanosized and curved liquid/liquid interfaces."

For this reason, mosquitoes have an enormous impact on humanity, as illustrated by the recent episodes of local Zika virus transmission in Florida and Texas, and the epidemic in Latin America. Preventing and mitigating the effects of mosquito-borne pathogens requires a detailed understanding of the interactions between mosquitoes and hosts. Globally, there are around 3,500 mosquito species, each with distinct preferences for certain hosts. Some take blood from any available vertebrate, but most prefer only certain animals (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, even fish). By understanding these relationships, researchers can assess how a pathogen moves through an ecosystem, and predict the risk of human infection. To investigate mosquito-host interactions, researchers use a method called blood meal analysis. Mosquito blood meals contain the DNA of their hosts, which is used to determine the host animal's identity. While these data provide insight on pathogen transmission, they can also improve understanding of vertebrate host communities. Results from this research will be disseminated via social media platforms and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. A graduates student will be trained and involved in all aspects of this work.<br/>	<br/><br/>The taxonomic composition of host DNA within a sample of mosquito blood meals reflects the vertebrate host community. Data generated through mosquito blood meal analysis are traditionally collected, analyzed, and interpreted under an epidemiological context. Following the emergence of methods for molecular species detection and environmental DNA analysis, host DNA derived from the blood meals of hematophagous invertebrates has been recognized as a source of molecular data that is informative to vertebrate conservation. This research integrates epidemiological methods of mosquito blood meal analysis and vertebrate diversity assessment, with the aim of generating datasets that are simultaneously valuable to both conservation and the characterization of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission networks. Current blood meal analysis approaches rely largely on polymerase chain reaction amplification and Sanger sequencing of the DNA barcoding regions of host genes. Because host DNA derived from the mosquito gut is inherently degraded by digestion, next generation sequencing approaches are likely to enhance the ability of making successful identifications. This research will identify the hosts of mosquitoes collected at two sites in Florida, Everglades National Park and the University of Florida campus, through next generation sequencing. Mosquito blood meals will be used to characterize the host communities of both sites, detect the presence of Burmese pythons and other invasive vertebrates in the Everglades, and enhance the understanding of relationships between mosquito species and host communities."

This research project will investigate the tree of life of living and fossil groups of marine snails, and the changes that happened in the shape of their shells through geological time. Snail shells are an iconic example of an organisms' effective defense against predators. With more than 30,000 described living species and countless fossils, snails are the most diverse group of invertebrate animals in the oceans; the diversity of their shell forms being equally impressive. Their rich fossil record shows a transition of shell features starting in the middle of the Mesozoic Era, around 160 million years ago. At that time, while dinosaurs thrived on land, fishes and crabs with increasing capacity of crushing shells were diversifying in the oceans. Changes in shell shape are thus hypothesized to be an evolutionary response to increased predation. If predation pressure was indeed an important driver during the evolution of shell shape, a general dominance of better-defended forms would be expected after the mid-Mesozoic. The researchers will gather data from an ample set of shells from fossil and living species to infer how they are related to each other and to estimate the times of origin of snail groups with different shapes; these results will be used to investigate the trajectory of the shell shape during the Mesozoic. Results from this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and science blogs broadly accessible to the public. A large number of shell images will be produced and made available online, including websites for science communication. In addition, high school and undergraduate students will be mentored in their first experience in science.<br/>	The members of Vetigastropoda, the specific group of marine snails under study (including abalone, key-hole limpets, top-shells and others), present great variation in shell height and level of coiling. Shorter and less coiled shells are particular features that could offer mechanical resistance against shell crushing. This study will test the hypotheses that: (1) the morphospace of shells became more restricted in response to predator selective pressure, and (2) the trajectory of shell shape trended towards shorter and less spired forms. Hypothesis testing will be accomplished by adding shell morphological data to a molecular phylogeny inferred from high-throughput sequence data. The fossil data will provide the basis for estimating divergence times in the phylogeny of vetigastropods, and for the comparison among distinct models of trait evolution."

Although an increasing number of researchers have begun to understand what drives uneven diversity between species, few researchers have examined how differences within single species can affect these broad scale evolutionary patterns. One source of variation lies in the difference between the sexes. The primary goal of this research is to build upon evolutionary theory by examining how sex differences contribute to species and phenotypic diversity. This research fills a critical gap in our understanding of how variation within species may drive larger patterns of species diversity. Through this research program, scientists will contribute to training the next generation of students through their mentorship of high school students through the UC Santa Cruz Science Internship Program (SIP), undergraduate student training in the Small Mammal Undergraduate Research in the Forest (SMURF) program, public talks through the Santa Cruz Public Library, and undergraduate teaching in Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy. <br/><br/>The skulls of musteloids (badgers, otters, raccoons, skunks, and weasels) will be used as a model to examine the effects of sexual dimorphism on phenotypic disparity at the macroevolutionary scale. Musteloids are a taxonomically rich and phenotypically disparate clade whose lineages exhibit uneven patterns of diversity. The researchers will use 3D geometric morphometrics and develop new comparative methods to test the hypothesis [H1a] that incorporating the effects of sex will reveal increased cranial disparity. Males and females in each species are predicted to occupy mostly non-overlapping parts of cranial morphospace; furthermore, the inclusion of both sexes will fill morphospace that was previously unoccupied when the analysis focused on a single sex. The researchers will then quantify the rates of cranial disparity through time in males and females separately and pooled together (species means) to test the hypothesis [H1b] that incorporating sex enhances the pattern of adaptive radiation (i.e. rapid increases in evolutionary rates near ecological opportunity followed by a slowdown in rates). A rate shift in cranial evolution is predicted to occur just after the onset of the Mid-Miocene Climate Transition when using the pooled male and female dataset. Lastly, the researchers will examine an ecological basis for sexual dimorphism by testing the hypothesis [H2] that the degree of carnivory corresponds with the evolution of sexual dimorphism in cranial shape and size across Musteloidea. Therefore, hypercarnivorous musteloids are predicted to exhibit the highest degree of cranial sexual dimorphism. We suspect that this disparity in hypercarnivores is present to mitigate competition between the sexes."

Thus, software developers practice regression testing -- running tests at each project revision -- to check that recent project changes do not break any functionality.  Although regression testing is important, it is costly due to the large number of revisions and tests, and the cost is reportedly increasing.  Several techniques -- test selection, test-case prioritization, test-suite reduction, and parallelization -- can reduce regression testing cost, but their applicability and cost reduction depend on software development processes, i.e., the way developers write code, build the projects, and run tests.  These processes are constantly evolving, sometimes making the existing regression-testing techniques inapplicable or ineffective.  The PI identified five emerging trends that impact applicability and effectiveness: use of multiple programming languages, use of various<br/>development tools, use of cloud-based continuous integration services, increase in the number of revisions and tests, and proliferation of non-deterministic code.<br/><br/>To significantly reduce the regression testing costs -- execution time, machine resources, and wasted developers' time caused by delays in detecting bugs -- the PI proposes five research activities that include designing and developing: (1) regression-testing techniques for projects written in multiple programming languages, (2) regression-testing techniques that remove unnecessary inefficiency due to behavior-preserving transformations and inadequate code structure, (3) techniques to reduce the cost of testing in the cloud, (4) techniques to reduce the cost of detecting the bug-introducing revision, and (5) techniques to identify, debug, and control non-determinism in tests.  This proposal has the potential to substantially reduce the cost of software testing, which will reduce financial losses and casualties due to software bugs. The project will integrate research and education by developing new curriculum based on newly developed ideas, along with the development of a new concept called top-teaching, which inserts Software Engineering materials into other courses, where the subject matter and students are dependent on software development and need to be informed about good software development practices."

The research goals are to develop a transformative mechanistic understanding of: (1) the hierarchy of assembled biomolecules on mineral surfaces; (2) the evolution of the trapping of organic contaminants within organo-mineral complexes; and, (3) the supramolecular architecture of biomolecular assemblies encapsulating contaminants at mineral interfaces. The outreach activities will be aimed at increasing the public literacy of the molecular-scale and nanoscale processes that drive the fate of organic matter and organic contaminants with relevance to public and ecosystem health. This task will be achieved through the implementation of a newly-designed program entitled ScENE VI: Scientific Explorations of the Natural Environment from the Visible to the Invisible. This program will be integrated with established partnerships with the local hands-on science museum Sciencenter, the Cornell cooperative extension office in New York City, the Cornell Occupational and Environmental Health, and the New York Department of Conservation. The activities through ScENE VI aim to provide interactive activities for young museum visitors and underrepresented teens of NYC 4-H youth development program."

Biodiversity provides us with important goods and services like water filtration, medicines, decomposition, food, and fiber. Without a basic knowledge of biodiversity through taxonomy, which is the science of naming and describing species, realizing the benefits of biodiversity to humanity is impossible. Even in the United States, many species remain undiscovered. For example, millipedes fulfill an important role as decomposers in forests by breaking down decaying organic matter and recycling its nutrients for other organisms to use. However, they are among the least known of any animal group in the U.S. This project focuses on the millipede groups Apheloria and Nannaria, which are widespread in Appalachian hardwood forests. Twenty-six species are known from the U.S., however, over 70 species of Apheloria and Nannaria await scientific naming and there is even a new species of Nannaria within the remnant forests of the D.C. metro area. This highlights the deficiencies in our understanding of millipede diversity, and this project, through the use of multiple data types, will identify new species and obtain better understanding of the diversity and evolutionary history of these groups in the Appalachian Mountains. <br/><br/>Eastern deciduous forests are tremendous repositories of irreplaceable biodiversity, but habitat loss threatens it. Many Appalachian invertebrates, which compose the most diverse component of this fauna, are unknown to science. It is imperative to understand and describe the diversity of this ecosystem before it is lost. This research project will discover and describe millipede species diversity in the U.S. by accomplishing the following objectives: (1) overcome basic taxonomic deficiencies in U.S. millipede studies using a rapid, technology-driven, and accurate approach to taxonomic treatments of the genera Apheloria and Nannaria; (2) establish a phylogenetic systematic foundation for describing species and as an evolutionary context to investigate camouflage and color evolution in xystodesmid millipedes; and (3) foster an appreciation for organismal biology and natural history by engaging the regional public through in-person outreach programs and the global community through the internet. These thumb-sized millipedes are remaining vestiges of a natural detritivore guild that historically encompassed native earthworms throughout the eastern United States."

Because it is complicated, a smart grid is more likely to be attacked due to misconfigurations and lacking security measures. Therefore, the secure and resilient operation of smart grids must be ensured by identifying potential threats and their impact and finding affordable solutions to defend against identified threats. This research aims to achieve these goals through the development of an efficient security analysis framework for the Energy Management System (EMS), a core smart grid component. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in advancing the science of security analysis for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) by integrating different theories, such as formal verification, model simulation, data and control flow, and security concepts, into the CPS components. This work will contribute to the CPS security science by: (a) developing a comprehensive formal model for stealthy attack verifications and (b) designing an efficient mechanism for systematically performing the impact-oriented threat analysis. Although this research targets EMS in smart grids, the approach is broad enough to be generalized for other CPS control loops that utilize measurement-based estimation.<br/><br/>CPS, like power grids, are critical to the national infrastructure, requiring that they be secure and dependable, especially with the increase of cyberwarfare. This research aims to address the urgent need to analyze CPS security. In addition to the technical project contributions, graduate and undergraduate level course modules on CPS security will also be developed. Underrepresented and minority students will be encouraged, through local and outreach activities, to participate in the project. Results of this project will be widely publicized in the research community through peer-reviewed journals articles and conference papers."

Very little is known about how nutrient allocation is regulated at the interface between the endosperm and the embryo. This project will investigate how two genes expressed in the endosperm influence the rate of sugar transport to the embryo. The outcome of the project will advance our knowledge on the genetic mechanisms that control seed size, which will be applicable to the improvement of yield and grain quality in crop species. This project will enhance research capacity and improve undergraduate STEM education through the integration of research and teaching at a women's liberal arts college for African Americans.

The project is expected to improve the recruitment of minority and women students into STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>It is well known that the timing of endosperm cellularization affects embryo growth rate. However, the underlying molecular mechanism has remained largely unexplored. This project will test the hypothesis that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) represses the expression of invertase inhibitor (InvINHs) genes to regulate sugar allocation between the endosperm and the embryo. The specific aims are to establish the causality between InvINHs and the suppression of embryo growth through genetic manipulation, and to identify the cis-elements and the transcription factors that regulate InvINHs expression. The proposed activity is expected to establish how a master regulator of endosperm cellularization, the PRC2 complex, regulates nutrient allocation between the embryo and the endosperm via the repression of InvINHs. A deeper understanding of this connection will allow us to further investigate how modifications in the endosperm developmental program have shaped the evolution of seed morphology."

The most direct way of addressing this challenge is to use modern environments that can be considered as analogues for those of early Earth. Such analogue environments are rare and valuable. This project will use two lakes in the Midwestern U.S. - Brownie Lake, MN and Canyon Lake, MI - whose waters were recently discovered to harbor abundant dissolved ferrous iron, which makes them good analogues for the anoxic ""ferruginous"" oceans that persisted for more than 2 billion years of Earth's history (during Archean and Proterozoic eons). Using field and analytical work, these researchers will investigate an early form of photosynthesis that relies on the redox cycling of iron (photoferrotrophy) and the corresponding cycle of methane, which would have been an important part of the ancient carbon cycle. This project will constrain the activity and biosignatures of the involved microorganisms. This is a necessary step to understand the rise of oxygen on Earth, the deposition of extensive iron-rich sediments that represent the majority of modern-day iron ore deposits, as well as major climate perturbations, and enigmatic carbon isotope excursions on the early Earth. A major emerging question is to what extent the greenhouse gas methane was generated and lost to the atmosphere in ferruginous oceans, and how this contributed to the global carbon cycle and climate. As prior investigations of ferruginous lakes as early Earth analogues utilized international sites, this project will serve U.S. scientists by establishing these two national research sites. The project will support two early career researchers, educate two graduate students, and involve several undergraduates in research. Project results and the established study sites will be used in hands-on graduate training in limnology. In collaboration with land managers of the two lakes, the project will provide a detailed physicochemical baseline to inform future water quality monitoring efforts in the lake watersheds, as well as will contribute to the City of Minneapolis environmental education outreach programs. 	<br/> 	<br/>Photoferrotrophy is thought to have been the major pathway for primary productivity in ferruginous Precambrian oceans. However, current analogues - meromictic ferruginous lakes - either suffer from light limitation for photoferrotrophy, fix carbon through predominantly sulfurbased photosynthetic pathways, or are located in regions unsuitable for seasonal monitoring. Brownie Lake has sufficient light and an abundant community of anoxygenic phototrophs (including photoferrotrophs), and deeper Canyon Lake has an extended oxic-anoxic transition zone and much lower nutrients than Brownie Lake. Together, these lakes comprise a range of conditions to investigate the controls that varying nutrient levels, physiography, and seasonality have on photoferrotrophic primary productivity and methane cycling. The team will monitor aqueous and carbon isotope geochemistry, microbial community composition, and elemental makeup/mineralogy of particulates from the Brownie and Canyon Lake water columns in order to determine: (1) the physicochemical conditions that regulate the presence and activity of photoferrotrophs, (2) the role of resident microbes in iron and carbon cycling, (3) the inorganic and mineral biosignatures that similar microbial communities might have left in Precambrian iron-rich sediments such as Banded Iron Formations (BIF), and (4) the isotopic imprint of photoferrotrophy and methanogenesis/methanotrophy to carbon and iron cycling.	<br/> "

Notholaenids ferns become dormant during the dry season but quickly rehydrate and restore photosynthetic activity when moisture returns. This drought adaptation is hypothesized to be related to a waxy substance called 'farina', primarily composed of plant pigments, that form a whitish-to-yellowish layer on the leaf undersurface. When leaves curl up in response to water stress, this leaf surface is directly exposed to sunlight. Two primary functional hypotheses for the waxy layer have been proposed: 1) it acts as a 'barrier' to help reduce water loss from evaporation; 2) it acts as a 'sunscreen' to protect water-stressed leaves from damage caused by overheating and UV-radiation. This study aims to investigate the evolution and function of farina in notholaenid ferns and address a critical gap in understanding how plants cope with drought stress and high solar irradiance by using a combination of anatomical, biochemical, biogeographical, ecophysiological, and molecular phylogenetic approaches. These data will provide new insights into the functional role of farina on fern leaves and drought resistance more generally that may be applied to other plant groups. One graduate student will be trained in a diversity of approaches, and a new undergraduate training module will be developed using ecological niche modeling to investigate the patterns of plant evolution.   <br/><br/>This study has three primary objectives: The first is key to understanding the evolution of farina in this group, and involves reconstructing the interspecific phylogenetic relationships among notholaenid ferns using DNA sequences from both nuclear and plastid markers. Objective two will focus on Notholaena standleyi, a widespread species with three well-recognized flavonoid chemotypes. The phylogenetic relationships, flavonoid constituents, ploidy levels, and geographic distribution of these chemotypes will be explored to determine whether polyploidy and abiotic niche divergence have helped to shape their current parapatric distributions. Objective three will investigate the proposed ecophysiological functions of farina by measuring gas exchange rates, water-use efficiency, and photosynthetic-recovery rates after drought treatment, before and after removing the farina. Detailed anatomical and optical properties of farina will also be examined."

This tectonic terrane has geologic affinities with continental crust in Svalbard and Greenland. It is postulated that the Pearya terrane is the best example along the Canadian Arctic margin of a crustal fragment that has been displaced by plate tectonic processes.  A proposed tectonic model for the origin of the Pearya terrane (the Paleozoic Northwest Passage model) postulates that many exotic or far-travelled geologic terranes that make up the northwestern Cordillera (e.g. Alaska) originated in the Caledonian orogenic belt shared by Greenland and Scandinavia, and subsequently traveled westward on a strike-slip fault to their current location about 400 million years ago.  The lack of documentation on the timing and movement sense of the Pearya terrane severely limits understanding of the tectonic evolution of the Arctic margin of North America, leaving room for recent models that claim Pearya was stationary and was not the result of tectonic displacement.  This project includes field observations and sample collection from remote southern boundary of the Pearya terrane that will be used to test these models.  The project is part of the 2017 Circum-Arctic Structural Events Expedition organized by the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, who will provide logistical support for the fieldwork.  The project will involve international collaboration with scientists from five countries. In addition to the scientific contributions of the project, the study will contribute to training of graduate and undergraduate students in an important science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) discipline, which is important in contributing to the enhanced compatibility of the U.S. workforce. The project will also contribute to broadening of underrepresented groups in STEM. Research results will be shared with the public through lectures and will be published in the peer reviewed scientific literatures and presentations at professional society meetings. Understanding the geological evolution of the North American Arctic margin is critical to informing important scientific, political and economic issues associated with the Arctic region. This award is cofunded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a stratigraphic, structural and metamorphic framework for the evolution of the complex southern boundary of the Pearya terrane.  The study entails integrated kinematic, petrochronologic and argon-argon thermochronologic analysis of the crystalline basement and major faults at the southern Pearya terrane margin; and detailed stratigraphic comparison across the terrane boundary through sandstone petrography, detrital zircon uranium-lead and hafnium analysis, and major, trace element and neodymium isotope geochemistry on mudstone.  Although the Canadian Arctic margin is often cited as an example of large magnitude terrane translation, little is known about the structures that may have accommodated such profound displacement.  The project will evaluate possible strike-slip tectonics in light of structures associated with transpression, which may reconcile the earlier observations of straight contraction. The results of this study will provide critical timing on the age of metamorphism and the early ductile history of the shear zones in order to see through the pervasive overprinting.  The principal investigators will also evaluate the stratigraphy of the overlap assemblage in different fault blocks to determine whether it is a single assemblage or, in fact, time correlatives of spatially separate depositional systems.  By producing a robust data set tied to the geology, this project will help discriminate among the disparate models that currently exist for the Pearya terrane and the larger tectonic development of the Arctic."

The research will explore fundamental questions such as: What makes a plan good?  How good is it?  How can we make it better?  And, how should we adjust plans when faced with uncertainty?  The research will produce automated planning and scheduling techniques that can robustly adapt to real-world, uncertain interactions with physical environments and teammates.

The specific research objectives are to (1) equip agents with more accurate plan representations by learning models of temporal uncertainty; (2) develop more useful measures of plan quality by introducing novel robustness and reliability metrics that predict the prospects of successful execution; (3) design more resilient scheduling methods by devising new online and offline heuristics that hedge against uncertainty; (4) construct more durable multi-agent coordination protocols by creating new decentralized algorithms for decoupling agents' schedules to allow robust, independent execution; and (5) demonstrate the efficacy of these ideas in the real world by evaluating on a diverse corpus of multi-robot benchmark problems.  If successful, this research will significantly improve the efficiency and usefulness of existing planning techniques in real-world settings and reframe how researchers analyze temporal plans.<br/>"

Meanwhile, near-threshold computing (NTC) emerges as a promising solution to improve energy efficiency by reducing the supply voltage, making it attractive for a broad range of applications from Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to cloud computing facilities. With the anticipated adoption of NTC in mainstream computing systems, security vulnerabilities that are unique to NTC will be ripe for exploitation. The objective of this project is to, for the first time, address NTC security concerns by performing a thorough and systematic investigation of its unique vulnerabilities to Side-Channel Attack (SCA) - attacks that rely on information leaked from the physical implementation of a cryptosystem.<br/>Side-channel attacks are perhaps one of the most covert and sophisticated among cyber threats. <br/><br/>Instead of treating security as an after-thought in traditional hardware development, in this project, we explore early-stage preventative methods to identify secure concerns in the design phase across different hardware implementation layers, and investigate the fundamental trade-off between efficiency and security in computing systems. Our investigation of the security implications of NTC will provide critical insights and methodologies for designing future efficient and secure computing systems. Due to its multi-disciplinary nature, our research project will promote the development and training of a strong workforce well-versed in the critical security domain across circuit design, computer architecture, and cryptography."

Hardware is at the most fundamental abstraction level on which software runs. Trusted hardware platforms comprise the backbone for successful deployment and operation of these infrastructures. Research in recent years shows that as tampering and reverse engineering mature in their sophistication, the challenges in guaranteeing the trust and security of these components also grow. The International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) aims to continue its role as a premiere forum that invites novel solutions to address these challenges. <br/><br/>Security attacks are growing in sophistication, and increasingly target hardware. Backdoors inserted into electronic designs can allow for silent intrusion into the system. Furthermore, new forms of attacks that exploit side-channel signals are being developed. In addition, intellectual-property (IP) protection is becoming a major concern in the globalized, horizontal semiconductor business model. The intellectual merit of this proposed activity includes professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium. Preparation has begun for HOST 2017 to be held in the Washington, DC Metro Area. This project provides opportunities for 36 students to receive travel support (i.e., registration, transportation, and lodging) to attend HOST 2017. Their attendance enables them to learn about the latest tools, design methods, architectures, circuits, and novel applications of secure hardware. Technical contributions from previous symposia have covered topics such as: (1) counterfeit detection and avoidance, (2) side channel analysis and fault analysis, (3) hardware architectures for cryptography, and (4) physically unclonable functions (PUFs). The travel grants would encourage more students to consider a technical submission, participation in hardware demonstration to a large diverse audience, or even to attend as a means to prepare for a technical submission in future years."

A core focus for this meeting is two important and timely areas of research. The conference will bring together leading experts with young researchers at a time of exciting developments and new breakthroughs.  Many of these recent developments were inspired by computer experiments, which are becoming more common within the fields of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.  The workshop will focus on developing Macaulay2, a leading computer algebra system within these fields.  By helping researchers develop their own packages, there will be immediate research impact as they and others compute new examples which push the mathematical frontier.  Such examples can answer old questions and inspire new ideas, just like those that are to be presented at the scientific conference. Further information is available at the conference website: https://macaulay2.github.io/Workshop-2017-Berkeley/<br/><br/>The first two days of the meeting will be a conference on free resolutions and commutative algebra. The time is ripe for such a conference; in Summer 2016 Irena Peeva and Jason McCullough (both of whom will speak at the meeting) resolved a famous 38-year-old conjecture on free resolutions due to Eisenbud-Goto. There has also been recent progress on Stillman's question, which asks for a bound on projective dimension of an ideal, based solely on the number of generators and degrees (Mel Hochster and Craig Huneke will give talks on their work). The meeting will then switch gears, to a software development workshop for Macaulay2, one of the world's leading software systems for supporting research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Macaulay2  is open source, and one of the key ways in which it extends its functionality is through packages, which allow researchers to write functions that utilize Macaulay2's core functions. The workshop will enhance research infrastructure by constructing packages which will be subsequently integrated into Macaulay2. It will also serve as a training ground for algebraists to use and write for Macaulay2. The workshop will build bridges and foster connections between workers on the theoretical and computational aspects of free resolutions. Macaulay2 workshops have a history of being inclusive both in terms of including underrepresented groups and for including participants from a wide variety of positions.  The organizers are committed to continuing this tradition."

However, recent evidence indicates that profundal quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have dramatically altered energy flow and nutrient cycling in the Laurentian Great Lakes and other large, deep aquatic systems, with negative consequences for many other components of the food web.  Previously, management strategies for these lakes relied on numerical models that predicted the lake's response to phosphorus loading.  The proliferation of benthic filter feeders in the lakes appears to have fundamentally altered the dynamics of phosphorus cycling and energy flow, so that these models are no longer valid.  This project measures energy flow and nutrient cycling processes in Lake Michigan, with a focus on the role of quagga mussels in these processes, and uses these measurements to develop numerical models to guide management decisions with regard to nutrient loading and fish stocking.  In addition to supporting the education of three Ph.D. students and providing research training for undergraduate students, the project promotes education of future aquatic scientists by hosting a workshop on interdisciplinary research and modeling for students and making workshop lectures available through an open-access project website.<br/><br/>This collaborative biophysical project is structured around two primary questions: 1) What role do profundal dreissenid mussels play in large lake carbon and nutrient cycles? 2) How are mussel grazing and the fate of nutrients recycled by mussels modulated by hydrodynamics at scales ranging from mm (benthic boundary layer) to meters (entire water column)? The investigators hypothesize that the apparent enhanced particle deliver rate to the lake bottom results from high filtration capacity combined with vertical mixing processes that advect phytoplankton from the euphotic zone to the near bottom layer. However, the role of hydrodynamics is unclear, because these processes are poorly characterized both within the hypolimnion as a whole and within the near-bottom layer. In addition, the implications for phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics are unclear, as mussels are both grazers and nutrient recyclers. State-of-the-art instruments and analytical tools, including particle image velocimetry, acoustic Doppler current profilers, and nutrient micro-profilers, are being deployed in Lake Michigan to quantify these critical dynamic processes, including boundary layer turbulence, mussel grazing, excretion and egestion, and benthic fluxes of carbon and phosphorus. Resulting data are used to calibrate a 3D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model, which is used to address the overarching question of how plankton and nutrient dynamics in large, deep lakes with abundant profundal filter feeders differ from the conventional paradigm described by previous models. The project also provides insight into bottom boundary layer physics, with applicability to other large lakes, atidal coastal seas, and the deep ocean."

Long standing genetic theories predict that these should rarely co-exist. Yet this dual strategy is surprisingly common in nature, suggesting that existing theory is inadequate. This project tests the hypothesis that ecological interactions among plant species help maintain dual strategies. When multiple plant species flower together and share pollinators, pollen is often wasted on flowers of other species, reducing the benefits of cross-pollination. The researchers will evaluate this hypothesis through a combination of theory development, field studies of pollinator behavior, and molecular genetic studies of parentage. This research will enhance conservation of plant and pollinator communities and will help scientists understand how invasive species and habitat fragmentation influence pollination. A partnership with an economically-disadvantaged K-12 school will foster improved understanding of conservation and biodiversity. <br/><br/>Focusing on the perennial plant Mimulus ringens, empirical and theoretical studies will investigate how pollinator sharing affects the tradeoff between outcross siring and selfing. Manipulative experiments will evaluate whether changes in the ecological context, the abundance of a co-flowering species Lobelia siphilitica, influence patterns of natural selection on selfing. Comparisons of 32 natural populations that vary in the type and abundance of co-flowering species will provide information on selfing rates, pollen limitation, floral morphology, and inbreeding depression, and evolutionary responses. Models will be developed using an adaptive dynamics approach that will incorporate the automatic advantage of selfing, evolutionary changes in inbreeding depression; it will account for pollen loss caused by the presence of a co-flowering species, and will explore the range of genetic and ecological factors that could generate stabilizing selection on mixed mating. These linked empirical and theoretical investigations will provide a broad new framework for understanding the evolution of plant mating systems."

Their levels can increase dramatically during times of environmental stress such as sun's ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, exposure to toxic chemicals, atmospheric pollutants, and inflammation. The imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and their removal by antioxidants results in a net accumulation of these species in the body, leading to the destruction of the cells and can cause a range of disorders such as cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, heart failure, stroke, autism, vitiligo, and depression. Engineered oxide nanoparticles have been shown to possess antioxidant activity and the ability to effectively regulate and scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen species. Despite many successes in the field, new breakthroughs are still needed to develop safer and more effective therapeutic nanoparticles. This research project seeks to establish a new approach toward the design and engineering of nanoparticles with high efficacy for trapping the reactive oxygen species in biological systems. The outcome of this project will allow researchers to further expand the family of nanoparticles used for the prevention and treatment of various types of diseases, and will ultimately impact society's health status and well-being. Besides the immediate impact of this research on the use of nanoparticles for therapeutic applications, the proposed scientific concept has the potential to lead to the discovery of highly responsive and selective nanoparticles for emerging applications such as real time selective biosensors, engineered plant functions for solar energy harvesting, and non-degradable polymeric membranes for low-emission vehicles. <br/><br/>Cerium oxide (ceria) nanoparticles have demonstrated the potential to actively scavenge a variety of reactive oxygen species in cell and animal models. The capacity of ceria nanoparticles to scavenge free radicals is strongly related to the exposed particle surfaces and considerably constrained by the limited number of oxygen vacancies on the surface. While the relatively immobile lattice vacancies in the core of particles do not contribute to the observed scavenging capacity of ceria nanoparticles, it may be possible to access these vacancies to regenerate the consumed oxygen vacancies on the surface to enhance the scavenging activity. In this Early Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project, an unconventional approach, based on the principles of oxygen vacancy migration in the field of solid state ionics, will be applied to explore fundamental relationships between lattice ion mobility and the surface scavenging activity of nanoparticles. The specific objective of the proposed research is to explore the scavenging properties of barium cerate nanoparticles in comparison with ceria nanoparticles in order to compare two compounds with similar transition metal cations (cerium), but with significantly different oxygen-ion mobilities. Utilizing lattice vacancies and continuous regeneration of surface oxygen vacancies to enhance the scavenging activity of nanoparticles is an entirely new concept to advance the field in novel and unexplored ways. A multidisciplinary team will synthesize and characterize oxide nanoparticles, and will evaluate the scavenging activity and redox-induced surface changes of the nanoparticles using spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques."

However, any  path towards an answer to this question must lead to the cutting edge of modern mathematics. In string compactifications the unanswered questions of physics become those of geometry and lead to novel approaches to questions ranging from invariants of singular spaces to birational correspondences and the classification of algebraic varieties, from Mirror Symmetry to the Geometric Langlands program. A symposium to foster such interdsiciplinary dialog between mathematicians and physicists is timely and important.

These analyses arise routinely in performance evaluations, risk analytics, and decision-making tasks in policymaking and many industries. The recent expansion of industrial system complexities challenges the use of conventional statistical methods in assimilating data, due to the heavy computational burden of high-fidelity simulation models, the intrinsic high dimensionality of stochastic problems, and the structural complications of data-system integration. The research program will blend the use of computational simulation with nonparametric statistics and modern optimization tools to produce methodologies that are both statistically accurate and computationally efficient. If successful, the research outcomes will aid in developing data-driven simulation-based tools for evaluating automated vehicle safety. The tools will be disseminated to relevant governmental and industrial units through institutional collaborative networks and online public channels. The research will also provide reliable, data-driven methodologies to assess risks and calibrate the simulation platforms used in various industries vital to the domestic economy. The education program will expand the undergraduate simulation curriculum, develop a new interdisciplinary graduate course, and provide practical case studies on the societal roles of the engineering profession. The education program will also provide training for graduate students and create undergraduate research opportunities, especially for under-represented minorities in engineering and data science.<br/><br/>The specific research objectives will develop statistical uncertainty quantification methods in four fundamental problems in stochastic and simulation analyses: 1) Rare-event prediction and computation; 2) Propagation of input model errors in simulation analysis; 3) Calibration of stochastic input models from output data; and 4) Quantification and enrichment of the feasibility of obtained solutions in data-driven stochastic optimization.  Each problem presents distinct challenges arising from small-sample bias, immense computational burden, high dimensionality, or over-conservativeness that impedes the effectiveness of existing methods.  The research will emphasize a unified framework to generate performance estimates using new formulations and analyses of optimization programs posited over stochastic spaces, with constraints derived or justified via nonparametric statistical methods.  The research will encompass the development of confidence bounds and the quantification of robustness to model misspecification, and the algorithmic analyses that ensure computational tractability in terms of optimization and simulation efficiencies.  The techniques developed will cross-fertilize areas across Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic and robust optimization, and statistics.  The research outcomes will also equip next-generation engineers with multi-faceted perspectives in using computational and statistical tools that will benefit their future careers."

This CAREER award supports computational research, cyberinfrastructure development, and education toward the ability to design nanoparticles with desired properties. Nanoparticles are encountered everywhere such as food, drugs, cars and cosmetics. The properties of nanoparticles are determined by the molecules they encompass, and can be precisely adjusted by using different kinds of molecules. Creating nanoparticles with specific properties and molecular constituents requires understanding how the molecules interact with each other and pack together. Given the vast number of molecules available, an efficient method is required to relate the characteristics of a nanoparticle to the properties of its molecular constituents. Of special interest are nanoparticles made of soft materials, such as those in car tires, jello and detergents, which can store various molecules. This CAREER project supports computational research and education on the computational design of mixed soft materials-based nanoparticles with desired characteristics. The PI's approach will use a method that includes essential physics and chemistry at different scales of length and time. The method will be aided by the development and use of advanced cyberinfrastructure. <br/><br/>This research will support activities to stimulate the interest of high school students in science, engineering and mathematics.

This CAREER award supports computational research, cyberinfrastructure development, and education toward the ability to design nanoparticles with desired properties. The PI aims to advance the ability to design of hybrid soft materials-based nanoparticles (NPs) with specific structure-property relations aided by the development and use of a cyber-enabled multiscale methodology. The conception of such designs will require a fundamental understanding of the role of molecular conformation, organization and mobility on the collective behavior of the distinct molecular species, and thereby, on material properties. The research lies at the interface of soft materials and advanced computing, and affords an opportunity to increase awareness, interest, recruitment, retention and training of a competitive workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas.<br/><br/>The PI seeks to design sterically stable hybrid NPs with morphologies optimized to store various molecules. The NP designs will require understanding the links between molecular traits and desired properties of hybrid soft materials. This will be facilitated by the development and use of a multiscale method that can link the compositional details of the NP to its desired attributes by integrating Molecular Dynamics simulations and analysis tools with advanced cyberinfrastructure. This plan will be realized through three objectives: (1) Development of hybrid NP designs; (2) Elucidation of the role of pH on hybrid NP designs, and (3) Prediction and validation of hybrid NP designs encompassing alternate chemical species.<br/><br/>The prediction of soft materials-based nanoparticles with desired properties will be significantly accelerated by understanding the relationship between molecular traits and structure-property relations. Both the design rules and the method can be extended to conceive other multicomponent soft material-based systems with targeted structure-property relations. In addition, the use of advanced computing tools in virtual soft materials design can nucleate the adoption of new computational methodologies by the community. This will facilitate the accelerated development of new soft materials-based innovations and technologies."

The performance of a plant's life history strategy depends on temperature, rainfall and soil nutrients. These environmental conditions vary around the world and from year to year. Over a long period of time, the life history strategy of a species adapts to the ranges of temperature, rainfall and other environmental conditions at a location. A plant adapted to do well in a desert may not be well adapted to live in a rain forest, and vice versa. When environmental conditions in a particular location change, a species' life history strategy may no longer be adapted to the new conditions, and its population growth rate may suffer. A plant species may be able to evolve a new strategy that works better in the changed environment, but the rate of adaptation may not keep pace with rapid environmental change. In that case local populations will shrink, increasing the risk of the species' extinction. Society needs to predict which plants are most at risk from changed environments to efficiently allocate scarce resources to species conservation. This study uses mathematical models to predict the best life history strategy for plant species living different environments, and to quantify how poorly adapted a species is to a change in the environment. Testing predictions of the effects of rapid environmental change on plant life history is difficult without measuring plant growth and reproduction in many years with a wide range of environmental conditions. Such long-term data sets are extremely rare, but in this study researchers will make use of a 30 year-long data set on the growth and reproduction of the plant species bitterroot milkvetch (Astragalus scaphoides), to test the predictions generated by their models. This research combines plant ecology and mathematical modeling, and will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in both disciplines. <br/><br/>The researchers will construct general models predicting life history strategies that maximize fitness measured as life time reproduction or population growth rate. Assuming natural selection selects for genotypes that maximize fitness, optimization models predict optimal life history strategies for various environmental conditions. Specifically, the models will answer the following questions: (1) What resource allocation strategy (growth, storage, reproduction) and dormancy frequency optimizes the fitness of perennial plants under different environmental conditions (nutrient availability, temperature, precipitation)? (2) What are the fitness consequences of rapidly changing environmental conditions? Further, the researchers will use a long term data set on performance of a perennial plant, A. scaphoides, to test the model predictions by asking: (3) Is the magnitude of observed variation in temperature and precipitation sufficient to negatively affect plant fitness?"

This has led to a deep understanding of the physics that distinguishes between, for example, superconductors and magnets, while also informing why the former is essential for biomedical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the latter used in electrical transformers. These insights are typically rooted in the assumption of thermal equilibrium. When equilibration fails, so does much of our understanding. This CAREER award supports basic research into utilizing quantum mechanical building blocks --- composed of atoms, ions, molecules and photons --- to explore new phases of matter that can emerge in strongly-interacting systems which are out-of-equilibrium. To this end, the PI will explore two complementary directions. The first direction focuses on quantum mechanical systems where strong disorder prevents equilibrium from ever being reached. A key question in this context is whether one can realize novel, intrinsically out-of-equilibrium phases of matter. The second direction focuses on understanding the way in which quantum systems that do equilibrate, manage to do so. A particular question of interest is whether there exists a ""speed limit"" on equilibration and if so, whether experimental AMO systems with long-range interactions can reach this limit. Alongside these research goals, the PI will implement a multi-layered outreach program aimed at training, recruiting and retaining high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in the physical sciences. A particular focus will be the establishment of a research immersion initiative and summer internship program aimed at helping undergraduate students from two-year colleges gain hands-on research experience. The project also includes funding for a tailored mentorship program focused on teaching undergraduate and graduate students effective skills for science communication, enabling them to become advocates for science literacy in society. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract: The last decade has seen the atomic, molecular and optical physics community make remarkable progress in the controlled manipulation of individual quanta. These advances have opened the door for the bottom-up realization of quantum many-body systems as well as the development of novel quantum technologies. This CAREER award supports basic research focused on utilizing the quantum optics toolbox associated with cold-atomic gases to explore topological phases, thermalization, and quantum dynamics in non-equilibrium systems. The non-equilibrium dynamics of entanglement and correlations remain some of the most poorly understood facets of quantum mechanics. To this end, the PI will explore new ""universality classes"" of quantum phases and dynamics, using a combination of analytic theoretical tools, state-of-the-art numerical computations, and experiments. In particular, the PI will characterize symmetry breaking and topological orders in strongly-interacting, periodically-driven, Floquet systems. While such periodic driving has emerged as a versatile tool in the quantum engineering of modern atomic systems, it remains an open question what specific types of novel phases can be realized in such Floquet systems. In addition, the PI will investigate foundational issues associated with the local quantum control of many-body systems. The proposed study will focus on leveraging tools from atomic and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, such as quantum phase estimation and quantum non-demolition measurement, to manipulate many-body excitations in disordered out-of-equilibrium systems. These research directions will also help to strengthen interdisciplinary connections between AMO physicists and condensed matter / quantum information scientists, as well as to provide a bridging dialogue between theoretical concepts and experimental implementations."

Transient heat fluxes in cutting-edge technologies can exceed 50 MW/m2, which is nearly the heat flux radiated by the Sun. To manage extreme thermal loads, the State-of-the-Art is to boil and evaporate liquid coolants on micro- and nano-structured heat sinks. However, modern cooling techniques cannot manage extreme heat fluxes under transient conditions. Thermo-fluid transients due to on/off device operation or intermittent exposure to an extreme environment result in highly unstable thermo-fluid behavior, ultimately placing a liquid-cooled device in danger of catastrophic failure via thermal runaway -- i.e., a rapid, uncontrolled increase in device temperature.<br/><br/>An integrated research-and-education program is pursued to broaden the institutional curriculum, training, and education on transient processes in modern technologies. A unique summer workshop and academic outreach activities will tap into several well-established STEM programs, facilitating the use of many educational elements -- including in-class projects, demos, videos, and discussions on transient operation and non-equilibrium processes. The technical objective is to identify the fundamental limits of evaporative heat transfer under transient conditions. The main approach is to test if the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of evaporating thin-films follows the predictions of the kinetic theory of gases. The project will incorporate a combination of time-resolved optical diagnostics to characterize the transient HTC and its dependence on interrelated factors such as vapor quality, superheat, and changes in heater surface structure and chemistry. These transient investigations coupled with steady-state and quasi-steady experiments are expected to reveal previously unexposed key heat transfer processes, increasing both the awareness and knowledge of transient processes in modern technologies, which are vital for new ideas in renewable energy, advanced computing, and nanotechnology."

Employment projections show a decline in conventional manufacturing jobs with marked growth in DM jobs.

Instead of pairing functionalities with the VR database, which prevents access by other modes, the decoupled approach allows for mode-independent approach, facilitating affordable access and broader implementation. The resultant curricular modules can be replicated for use on multiple machines without additional costs. During manufacturing process training, VR tools serve as a viable alternative offering a cost and material-efficient solution.

Shallow coastal bays are found along much of the east coast, and are particularly vulnerable to the effects of excess nitrogen, which can lead to algal blooms, low dissolved oxygen, and loss of high-habitat quality seagrasses.  This research will examine the recovery of a shallow bay as nitrogen inputs are greatly reduced without any concomitant change in inputs of other nutrients and pollutants, making it perhaps the first such study in the US.  The site, West Falmouth Harbor on Cape Cod (MA), has received high levels of nitrogen inputs for the past 15 years, due to contamination of incoming groundwater by a sewage treatment plant, causing poor water quality and habitat degradation.  The nitrogen contamination has now been cleaned up, and so nitrogen inputs entering the harbor will be 3-fold less than in the past.  To date, relatively few coastal bays have recovered from excessive nitrogen inputs, so this study will provide information on the rate of recovery and extent of restoration of habitat quality that is critical to better manage and protect these valuable coastal resources.   <br/><br/>While most coastal scientists believe nitrogen is the primary cause of coastal eutrophication, this remains debated.  This study will provide important insights as to not only whether nitrogen is the controlling nutrient, but if so, why.  One hypothesis is that a large net import of phosphorus from deeper coastal water helps maintain N limitation. If so, net phosphorus import should decline as primary production (and resultant demand for phosphorus) declines.  The research will also explore the relationship of carbon storage to net ecosystem production, testing the hypothesis that lower nitrogen inputs will shift the ecosystem towards greater heterotrophy. Will the harbor continue to store carbon, by importing more carbon than the net amount respired?  These questions will be addressed by measuring rates of primary production and ecosystem respiration from diel changes in dissolved oxygen and pH, seagrass extent and biomass elemental composition, and by measuring the exchanges of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon between the harbor and the deeper adjacent coastal waters of Buzzards Bay, MA.  Results will be compared with 12 years of data taken during the high nitrogen loading period, and will thus provide a strong picture of the recovery trajectory of the system."

For the development and implementation of SnowVision, Dr. Smith and her team focus on the designs embellished on Swift Creek pottery, ca. AD 200-800, found on sites throughout the Deep South. Swift Creek's curvilinear designs, which were carved onto wooden paddles and subsequently stamped onto pottery vessels, offer insights into networks of exchange, ritual, and mobility at an unprecedented level of granularity when paddle matches are found across archaeological contexts, as they so often are. Limitations of time, design expertise, and collections access have been the primary impediments to advancement in the study of these pre-Columbian networks, for which design matches provide unequivocal evidence. SnowVision will increase the speed by which researchers are able to identify design matches from different archaeological sites. This will, in turn, incentivize the digitization of understudied collections. By making the software and related pottery sherd images available online, SnowVision also will increase the reach of collections curated in different museums.

A comprehensive book will provide up-to-date taxonomy, identification keys, and photographs of salient features as well as ecology and distribution data. With the clarification of the systematics, biogeographic trends can be assessed more succinctly for genera and species. Compiling physical and chemical data from habitats within a single location will facilitate understanding of taxon distributions, ecological niche space, and potential range changes in the past and into the future.

This is tactically challenging, because although the Higgs Mass is large, the masses of the sought for spin-zero particles are low and the energies of the observed particles are similarly low. Additionally, these events are expected to be very rare, and to find them requires high intensity colliding beams at the LHC over several years.  To enhance the technical capabilities of the ATLAS detector to observe these particles, the UIUC group is collaborating with ATLAS colleagues in the development of new electronics upgrades to the experiment, to allow for the effective triggering and recording of these particles.   <br/><br/>Martinez Outschoorn brings significant experience in outreach and education to her companion program called the ""Particle Adventure"", which will connect elementary and middle school students in grades 4-8, including children from underrepresented and at-risk groups, to the excitement of physics with the aid of undergraduate and graduate student volunteers from the UIUC Physics Department.

This tectonic terrane has geologic affinities with continental crust in Svalbard and Greenland. It is postulated that the Pearya terrane is the best example along the Canadian Arctic margin of a crustal fragment that has been displaced by plate tectonic processes.  A proposed tectonic model for the origin of the Pearya terrane (the Paleozoic Northwest Passage model) postulates that many exotic or far-travelled geologic terranes that make up the northwestern Cordillera (e.g. Alaska) originated in the Caledonian orogenic belt shared by Greenland and Scandinavia, and subsequently traveled westward on a strike-slip fault to their current location about 400 million years ago.  The lack of documentation on the timing and movement sense of the Pearya terrane severely limits understanding of the tectonic evolution of the Arctic margin of North America, leaving room for recent models that claim Pearya was stationary and was not the result of tectonic displacement.  This project includes field observations and sample collection from remote southern boundary of the Pearya terrane that will be used to test these models.  The project is part of the 2017 Circum-Arctic Structural Events Expedition organized by the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, who will provide logistical support for the fieldwork.  The project will involve international collaboration with scientists from five countries. In addition to the scientific contributions of the project, the study will contribute to training of graduate and undergraduate students in an important science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) discipline, which is important in contributing to the enhanced compatibility of the U.S. workforce. The project will also contribute to broadening of underrepresented groups in STEM. Research results will be shared with the public through lectures and will be published in the peer reviewed scientific literatures and presentations at professional society meetings. Understanding the geological evolution of the North American Arctic margin is critical to informing important scientific, political and economic issues associated with the Arctic region. This award is cofunded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a stratigraphic, structural and metamorphic framework for the evolution of the complex southern boundary of the Pearya terrane.  The study entails integrated kinematic, petrochronologic and argon-argon thermochronologic analysis of the crystalline basement and major faults at the southern Pearya terrane margin; and detailed stratigraphic comparison across the terrane boundary through sandstone petrography, detrital zircon uranium-lead and hafnium analysis, and major, trace element and neodymium isotope geochemistry on mudstone.  Although the Canadian Arctic margin is often cited as an example of large magnitude terrane translation, little is known about the structures that may have accommodated such profound displacement.  The project will evaluate possible strike-slip tectonics in light of structures associated with transpression, which may reconcile the earlier observations of straight contraction. The results of this study will provide critical timing on the age of metamorphism and the early ductile history of the shear zones in order to see through the pervasive overprinting.  The principal investigators will also evaluate the stratigraphy of the overlap assemblage in different fault blocks to determine whether it is a single assemblage or, in fact, time correlatives of spatially separate depositional systems.  By producing a robust data set tied to the geology, this project will help discriminate among the disparate models that currently exist for the Pearya terrane and the larger tectonic development of the Arctic."

Hu proposes to integrate research and education in an investigation of carbon cycling and ocean acidification in the Mission-Aransas Estuary in South Texas. This coastal system is strongly affected by changes in river flow between seasons and from year to year. The relationship of changing river flows to carbon cycling in estuaries is not well understood. This lack of understanding in turn contributes to uncertainty in estimating global estuarine carbon budgets. In addition, climate change and other human activities heavily influence riverine input into estuaries and the coastal ocean, which then affect biogeochemistry and metabolism in these environments. Despite the need for this information, long-term records that can help to address the change in the strength and directions of CO2 fluxes in these ecosystems are very rare. Using high-intensity field sampling and analysis of historical data, this project aims to improve understanding of carbon cycling in this estuary and in the coastal ocean in general. The results obtained from this study will also provide key information about the biogeochemical response of estuaries to changing hydrologic conditions, as the southwestern U.S. grows drier with overall declining precipitation.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project include 1) investigating the relationship between hydrologic state and estuarine CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) in a case study of the Mission-Aransas Estuary, a subtropical semiarid estuary, 2) understanding the extent of CO2 flux and its hydrologic control in one of the world's largest lagoonal estuarine systems along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, and 3) elucidating the mechanisms that lead to estuarine acidification and its feedback to CO2 fluxes. Intensive field campaigns for high-temporal resolution pCO2 and water carbonate chemistry sampling as well as sediment incubation will be carried out; analysis of multidecadal carbonate chemistry parameters that have been collected by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality will be used to obtain temporal trends of estuarine water pCO2 against the backdrop of increasing freshwater scarcity in this region. The education component of this CAREER award includes 1) creating an ocean and estuarine acidification research course and redesigning two existing courses for both undergraduate and graduate students, 2) collaborating with Foy Moody High School on their Aquatic Science education to engage high school students predominantly from underrepresented and economically challenged backgrounds in field and lab experiences. The ultimate educational goal is to encourage high school students to follow a STEM path for their college education, and undergraduate STEM students to pursue graduate degrees. This will be a part of the concerted effort to enhance diversity in the future workforce by increasing the number of underrepresented graduates with bachelor's or higher degrees in the STEM fields.  This project will train one Ph.D. student. High school students and undergraduate interns from underrepresented and economically challenged backgrounds will also be supported to participate in summer research. Broader dissemination of the project findings will include undergraduate student presentations at symposiums organized by both TAMU-CC and the Texas A&M University System, public seminars by both the graduate students and the principal investigator at various meetings organized by regional estuarine programs, presentations at national and international meetings, and publications in peer-reviewed journals."

These wetlands support specialized plant, microbe and animal species that collectively form some of the Earth's most productive ecosystems, influencing the ecology of estuaries and coastal oceans. Coastal wetlands are also under severe pressure from human activity which threatens to diminish the many benefits they provide to people and aquatic food webs. Among these benefits is the fact that they remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and bury it in soils for centuries to millennia. Indeed, these ecosystems account for nearly 50 percent of the organic carbon buried in sediments despite occupying less than 2 percent of terrestrial area. This surprising fact suggests an opportunity: that protecting, restoring and managing coastal ecosystems could improve the ecological and social benefits they provide. The pace of research on this topic has accelerated and there is a great need to coordinate ongoing research and synthesize existing information. The goal of this Research Coordination Network (RCN) project is to advance understanding of carbon cycling in coastal wetlands by creating a central repository for sharing data, and facilitating synthesis and modeling to better predict the functioning of coastal ecosystems.<br/> <br/><br/>The Coastal Wetland Carbon Research Coordination Network will accelerate scientific discovery, advance science-informed policy, and improve coastal ecosystem management by: (1) developing a community dedicated to coastal wetland carbon science for basic research, policy development, and management, (2) exploring the ecological links among coastal wetlands, estuaries, and the atmosphere, and (3) sharing data and analysis tools that support the diverse needs of scientists, policy makers and managers. Activity 1 will establish a repository for participant-contributed data, and a central portal for downloading data from repositories of interest to the coastal carbon community. Activity 2 will create a Coastal Wetland Carbon website to attract participation of diverse users by providing a variety of resources that meet their needs. It will provide data analysis tools, a knowledge sharing resource, a video library of training modules in standard methods, a code library to support modeling, links to publications, and a webinar library. This RCN project will also provide outreach via a series of webinars and town hall gatherings at professional meetings, host a series of workshops on scientific gaps in coastal carbon, and develop a web-based tool for modeling."

Palms are an interesting group of plants from both an evolutionary and environmental perspective. They have a long evolutionary history stretching back at least 90 million years, evidenced by a rich and widespread fossil record, and are useful indicators of past environmental conditions due to the narrow climatic range within which most can survive. By using the fossil record to inform the evolutionary history of palms, this research seeks to understand their geographical range, and how they have responded to changing environments throughout their history. This research will test current hypotheses on palm evolution, and generate publicly available databases of living and fossil palm diversity. One graduate student will be trained in diverse systematics methods, and datasets generated by this research will also be used to train undergraduates from underrepresented groups. Materials from the research will also be used to develop interactive exhibits for teaching about plant structure, diversity, and evolution to the public.<br/><br/>This project investigates the historical biogeography of the palm family by incorporating empirical data from the geologic record into phylogenetic and model-based biogeographic analyses. It will test current hypotheses of a Laurasian origin of the crown node of Arecaceae and of the biogeographic origins of the major subfamilies. This work will also investigate the role of shifting continental geography in the radiation of palms, and how climatic changes correlate with shifts in dispersal and extinction rates over the last 100 million years. A comprehensive database of the palm fossil record will be compiled and the data incorporated into a dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model to infer historical ranges of taxa, and a dispersal-extinction-sampling model to compute dispersal and extinction rates over time, which can be correlated with climate data. Fossil fruits with sufficient characters for inclusion in a phylogenetic analysis will be studied using X-ray micro-computed tomography, and will be used to generate a time-calibrated phylogeny for use in the DEC analysis. Outcomes include a comprehensive fossil record database for palms, 3D morphological data on living palms, a tribe-level chronogram for the family, and new insights into the historical biogeography of this important group of plants."

Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in adopting wireless sensor-actuator network (WSAN) technology for industrial networks. This project will develop highly self-adaptive WSANs, enabling a broad range of industrial process applications, which affect economics, security, and quality of life. Successful completion of this project will significantly spur the installation of WSANs with the potential of greatly improving industrial efficiency, leading to a significant reduction of the operating costs, which can help create more jobs. The end objective of this project is to incorporate the project outcomes into the next generation of industrial WSAN standards and real-world products. Project findings will be presented at major international conferences and published in their proceedings and high-impact journals and also used for enriching education and outreach.<br/><br/>IEEE 802.15.4 based WSANs operate at low-power and can be manufactured inexpensively, which makes them ideal for industrial process applications where energy consumption and costs are important. However, the stringent and diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements and dynamic industrial environments make managing WSANs a daunting task. A key missing piece of the WSAN management puzzle is a self-adaptation component, which allows WSANs to adapt themselves to consistently satisfy the dynamic QoS requirements in uncertain environments. Industry consequently has shown a marked reluctance to embrace WSAN technology. The overarching goal of this project is to accomplish runtime parameter self-adaptation for industrial WSANs in uncertain environment. This project will develop rigorous scientific methods for equipping industrial WSANs with capabilities of optimally configuring themselves based on specific QoS requirements and adapting the configurations at runtime to consistently satisfy the dynamic requirements in uncertain environments. This project aims to advance the state of the art of industrial WSANs through creating a new paradigm of parameter self-adaptation, resulting in improved network performance and better network resource management. This project will also accomplish an increased understanding of the performance tradeoffs that exist in WSANs and enable the development of new solutions to inform users with accurate user-appropriate information on network performance tradeoffs and configuration choices."

Parasites by definition harm the fitness of individuals (hosts), and thus are expected to have a powerful influence on host abundance, population cycles and the evolution of their defenses. This research will identify how genetic variation in host defenses is maintained and thus how hosts evolve to reduce the effects of parasites. The research uses two species of fruit flies, Drosophila species, and their mite parasites as a model. The research outcomes will inform the development of improved pest control strategies in agricultural settings, and new methods to control disease vectors that are of significance to human health and wellbeing. Research outcomes will be integrated into educational outreach programs involving high school students and the general public. <br/><br/>A major hypothesis for the maintenance of genetic variation in defensive traits, and hence for the enormous evolutionary potential of parasitism, involves costs of resistance. Costs are expressed as trade-offs between host resistance and other fitness-related traits, such as reproductive output, in the absence of parasites. There are few data available for animal host-parasite systems on the genetic and physiological bases of costs of resistance, despite their widespread importance. The researchers will bridge studies of host molecular, metabolomic, and physiological processes, with whole-organism fitness functions, to understand the mechanistic bases of costs of parasite resistance. Using two naturally occurring host-parasite systems, three interrelated aims will be achieved. 1) Test for trade-offs between evolved ectoparasite resistance and major life-history traits in D. melanogaster. 2) Determine and compare the causal molecular and metabolomic factors of ectoparasite resistance and of trade-offs in the two systems. 3) Identify the physiological and anatomical mechanisms underlying fitness costs. The results will be unique to animals, and will complement studies in plant and microbial systems. The research will thus contribute to the development of a unified theory of resistance evolution."

Determination of the governing mechanisms of fuel spray atomization will help researchers develop more accurate computer models, which will be used as a predictive tool for the discovery of new high-efficiency clean combustion strategies.

The research approach is centered on the employment of a new state-of-the-art high-pressure optically-accessible combustion chamber recently commissioned within my laboratory at Georgia Tech via institutional support, which enables optical spray and combustion measurements at up to 100 bar and 900 K. A two-wavelength tomographic extinction measurement is developed to enable simultaneous 3-D measurements of droplet SMD and liquid volume fraction distribution in practical fuel sprays under combustion-relevant conditions. Hypothesis testing of the governing atomization mechanisms in fuel sprays is conducted via measurements with controlled orifice geometry and fuel properties over a wide range of ambient gas density conditions."

Members of the lobelia plant family (Lobeliaceae) restricted to the Hawaiian Islands have undergone a remarkable divergence in habitat, growth form, leaf size and shape, floral morphology, and mechanism of seed dispersal, and are considered one of the best examples of an adaptive radiation in plants. Previous studies have shown that this group of 140 species was derived from a single colonization 13 million years ago, long before many of the Hawaiian islands of today had emerged from the Pacific. Hawaiian lobeliads now represent 12% of the native Hawaiian flora and are the most species-rich plant lineage found on any single group of oceanic islands on Earth. The two largest genera, Cyanea and Clermontia, comprising approximately 100 species form the largest sublineage within the group. Previous phylogenetic analyses of Cyanea-Clermontia were inconclusive due to a combination of limited sampling within the group and insufficient DNA sequence variation to reconstruct a well-supported estimate of relationships. Cyanea-Clermontia, by its very size, ecological and morphological diversity, and high proportion of species restricted to single islands (each of known age), offers unique opportunities for studying adaptive radiation, speciation, and historical biogeography. Understanding relationships within this lineage could provide new insights into the rise of plant and animal diversity on Hawaii, and identify traits associated with a tendency to become rare or extinct. This project will (1) broadly train a graduate student in plant systematics and historical biogeography analyses; (2) develop molecular phylogenetic analysis pipelines to aid in the study of other recent radiations; (3) produce a well-documented collection of DNA samples to permit future studies of this important group; and (4) create a website on the diversification of native Hawaiian lobeliads, to disseminate findings to a broad range of amateur botanists and lobeliad enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Next-generation DNA sequencing data will be used to infer phylogenies of Cyanea-Clermontia from whole-chloroplast genomes and >400 nuclear genes for all living species sampled across their range. Analyses of these data will permit derivation of species trees and networks, analysis of hybridization, introgression, and other forms of reticulate evolution (important in Clermontia), reconstruct its geographic spread through time, and infer the pattern and tempo of evolution of key morphological and ecological character-states using a variety of tree- and network-based approaches."

However, recent evidence indicates that profundal quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have dramatically altered energy flow and nutrient cycling in the Laurentian Great Lakes and other large, deep aquatic systems, with negative consequences for many other components of the food web.  Previously, management strategies for these lakes relied on numerical models that predicted the lake's response to phosphorus loading.  The proliferation of benthic filter feeders in the lakes appears to have fundamentally altered the dynamics of phosphorus cycling and energy flow, so that these models are no longer valid.  This project measures energy flow and nutrient cycling processes in Lake Michigan, with a focus on the role of quagga mussels in these processes, and uses these measurements to develop numerical models to guide management decisions with regard to nutrient loading and fish stocking.  In addition to supporting the education of three Ph.D. students and providing research training for undergraduate students, the project promotes education of future aquatic scientists by hosting a workshop on interdisciplinary research and modeling for students and making workshop lectures available through an open-access project website.<br/><br/>This collaborative biophysical project is structured around two primary questions: 1) What role do profundal dreissenid mussels play in large lake carbon and nutrient cycles? 2) How are mussel grazing and the fate of nutrients recycled by mussels modulated by hydrodynamics at scales ranging from mm (benthic boundary layer) to meters (entire water column)? The investigators hypothesize that the apparent enhanced particle deliver rate to the lake bottom results from high filtration capacity combined with vertical mixing processes that advect phytoplankton from the euphotic zone to the near bottom layer. However, the role of hydrodynamics is unclear, because these processes are poorly characterized both within the hypolimnion as a whole and within the near-bottom layer. In addition, the implications for phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics are unclear, as mussels are both grazers and nutrient recyclers. State-of-the-art instruments and analytical tools, including particle image velocimetry, acoustic Doppler current profilers, and nutrient micro-profilers, are being deployed in Lake Michigan to quantify these critical dynamic processes, including boundary layer turbulence, mussel grazing, excretion and egestion, and benthic fluxes of carbon and phosphorus. Resulting data are used to calibrate a 3D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model, which is used to address the overarching question of how plankton and nutrient dynamics in large, deep lakes with abundant profundal filter feeders differ from the conventional paradigm described by previous models. The project also provides insight into bottom boundary layer physics, with applicability to other large lakes, atidal coastal seas, and the deep ocean."

Nevertheless, how herbivores process natural toxins remains poorly understood. For example, remarkably little is known about the specific genes that control an animal's ability to process potentially toxic compounds in plants. To address these fundamental problems, this research will focus on a dramatic dietary change: woodrats normally eat juniper and cactus, but several populations in the American southwest have switched to a diet of creosote bush. Creosote bush produces natural toxins that radically differ from juniper and cactus, and therefore the specialized woodrat populations must detoxify their diets differently than the juniper and cactus-eaters. The goal of this project is to identify DNA-level changes that are associated with woodrats' ability to feed on a toxic diet of creosote bush. This project will develop new genomic tools that will be useful to the broader scientific community. A better understanding of how animals process toxins can also impact decisions about pharmaceutical development for humans and other animals, and influence feeding options to improve production of free-ranging domestic herbivores like cattle. Results of this work will be communicated to the public through an interactive display about the ecology of woodrats at the Utah Museum of Natural History.  <br/><br/>Despite decades of pharmacological research on model species and humans, the mechanisms used by mammalian herbivores to metabolize plant secondary compounds and the genomic basis underlying adaptation to new diets remain poorly understood. This research will investigate the evolution of dietary adaptation and specialization in mammalian herbivores by capitalizing on a dramatic diet change event: the replacement of juniper (Juniperus spp.) and cactus (Opuntia spp.) with creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) in the diets of herbivorous woodrats. The project has three goals:  1) Identify genomic changes associated with a radical dietary shift in Neotoma lepida.  2) Test for the repeated involvement of similar genetic pathways for specialization on creosote diets in N. bryanti. 3) Characterize the transcriptomic response of parental and hybrid populations of N. lepida and N. bryanti to a creosote diet. The proposed work leverages modern evolutionary genomic approaches to address a long-standing question in physiological ecology: which mechanisms are important in the processing of toxic diets? The project will lead to a deeper understanding of the responses of organisms to changes in the environment, including fundamental information at the genomic level about how mammalian herbivores adapt to dietary toxins. The project specifically tests whether the same genomic regions are under selection in two species that independently evolved the ability to specialize on creosote diets. An interactive display about the ecology of woodrats and their importance to society will be developed in collaboration with the Utah Museum of Natural History. Genomic tools will be developed that will be useful to the broader scientific community. In addition, the PIs will mentor students (high school through graduate) and postdocs in physiological genomics research on non-model species."

Specifically, the polymers have applications in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), bioelectronics, sensors, and electronic skin. However, for these polymers to be used in a wide range of electronic applications, it is important to understand how the long polymer molecular chains fold in the solid state of the material and how this folding affects its electronic properties. To this end, the PI and her group at the University of Washington will develop, synthesize, and study a new class of pi-conjugated semiconducting polymers that can fold at specific locations along a polymer chain, and establish new ways to affect the optoelectronic properties of these polymers. The relevance of the project to a number of applications provides us with an opportunity to communicate the importance of science and engineering to the community. Specifically, an exhibition about polymers will be created in collaboration with the Pacific Science Center (a science museum in Seattle). Additionally, the PI will work with a group known as Diversity in Clean Energy (DICE) at the University of Washington to support women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/> <br/>Within the field of pi-conjugated semiconducting polymers, there is a growing realization that defects such as homocoupling and end-groups can adversely affect the properties and thus the performance of these polymers in actual applications. However, what is not clearly understood is why these defects affect the properties in the way that they do. In this proposal, the PI and her group aim to shed light on how point defects can affect microstructure and thus their properties. The research entails the following: (i) synthesizing pi-conjugated semiconducting homopolymers with precisely spaced defects; (ii) assessing how the size of and spacing between defects affect the microstructure of the homopolymers; and (iii) expanding the design rules established in parts (i) and (ii) to alternating copolymers. The research is envisioned to provide means to design the microstructure of pi-conjugated semiconducting polymers with an unprecedented level of control instead of relying only on optimization methods as is typically done."

Compared with larger fragments, small fragments are often extreme environments because they can experience stresses like higher temperatures, more light, and lower soil moisture. This research looks at how plants living in different sized fragments are affected by their pathogens. Interactions between plants and their pathogens are important because although pathogens are best known for the damage they cause they can also help preserve biological diversity. This is because each plant species has its own unique group of pathogens that specialize on it, and slows growth or kills just the plants they infect. This can keep any single plant species from dominating in an area. However, not all pathogens can thrive in the extreme environments found in small patches. It may be that in small patches, different types of pathogens that slow growth or kill multiple plant species indiscriminately are more common. If this is the case, they could decrease plant diversity compared with large patches. By uncovering how plants and pathogens interact in different patch sizes this work will be relevant for understanding the biodiversity consequences of breaking up natural areas, and may affect management of natural landscapes. Both lead researchers for this project are early-career faculty at undergraduate colleges, and will incorporate undergraduate students into all aspects of this work, including community outreach.<br/><br/>Three parallel studies will be conducted to assess how plant-pathogen interactions are altered by landscape fragmentation, focusing on fungal pathogens in particular. First, researchers will bury seeds of twelve plant species in patches of different sizes at the Kansas Fragmentation Site, allowing the seeds to be colonized by potential pathogens and testing to see if the seeds remain viable after a year of burial. This will determine if seed mortality due to fungal pathogens is most influenced by ecological factors that vary with patch size, such as plant host density, plant species richness, and microclimatic conditions (such as temperature and soil moisture). Second, the fungal community from these buried seeds will be characterized using both culture-based methods and culture-independent molecular tools. This will determine whether fungal community structure varies predictably with patch size, host identity, and host density. Finally, a combination of greenhouse and field experiments will test the hypothesis that negative feedbacks (when plants ""culture"" host-specific pathogens in the soil surrounding their roots) are strongest in the interiors of large patches, rather than on the edges of large patches or in small patches. It is predicted that thermally stressful environments on edges and small patches will favor generalist fungi, reducing the influence of diversity-maintaining feedbacks on smaller fragments. Collectively, these studies link individual plant-fungal interactions to observed landscape patterns in plant diversity."

One process involved in species formation is known as ecological speciation, which occurs when different environments promote genetic diversification in a geographically widespread species. It is particularly useful to investigate and model this process in organisms that naturally disperse widely, such as bats. This project will explore differences within and among closely related species of the western long-eared Myotis bats. A novel aspect of this work will be the development of an analytical framework that tests for correlations between phenotypes and genotypes while controlling for environmental variation. This analytical pipeline will be made publicly available, and may be used to test the predictions of ecological speciation in a variety of different organisms. Results from this work will also have important practical implications to bat conservation efforts. To communicate findings from this research to a broader audience, an online interactive museum focused on the tempo and mode of speciation of Myotis bats will be developed. <br/><br/>This research will identify phenotypic evidence of ecological speciation in western long-eared Myotis bats of North America by co-analyzing genomic, morphological, and environmental data. Previous findings demonstrate that these species follow a pattern of speciation-with-gene-flow that might have been promoted by environmental changes. Therefore the hypothesis that morphological differentiation among these bat species is associated with both divergence-with-gene-flow patterns and environmental variation will be tested. Specifically, craniodental shape and size variation among these species across different environments will be examined, using geometric morphometric approaches. A novel approach that accounts for both genetic and environmental covariation on morphometric differences within and among species will be developed. This framework will use geometric morphometrics coupled with environmental niche and genomic scan analyses to identify outlier loci that may have evolved under divergent selection. Finally, this new framework will be applied to predict morphometric variation among the western long-eared bats and differentiate between phenotypic convergence and gene flow among species. This integrative approach will allow us to understand the tempo and mode of speciation of Myotis bats from a phenotypic, genetic and environmental perspective."

The program provides a unique research community-of-peers setting that emphasizes developing the independence of each student. Rather than having students work in groups on problems with a faculty adviser who contributes substantially to the research effort, at Duluth the approach is to treat undergraduate students with extraordinarily high potential for doing significant research as though they are working on a PhD thesis problem where the adviser provides the problem and mentoring but avoids direct involvement in solving the problem.<br/><br/>The program has a 38 year history of developing students into independent, high level research mathematicians and integrating them into the research community at an early stage of their careers. The program has produced over 200 papers published in well regarded professional research journals and 133 PhDs. The development of human resources is the explicit purpose of the Duluth REU program.  The most significant contribution the Duluth program makes towards that purpose is the training of future generations of mathematicians who will foster undergraduate research when they become professionals. Participants in the program become part of a network of extraordinary alumni who are important members of the mathematics community. Among them are people who are tenured, or on tenure track, at Princeton (Fields medal winner and member of the National Academy of Sciences), MIT (3 total, one with an endowed chair and a member of AAAS), Stanford, Chicago, Berkeley, Columbia, Cornell, UC San Diego and Northwestern. Ten are American Mathematical Society Fellows. Duluth REU alumni have substantially contributed to the national security and the economic competitiveness of the U.S. Many alumni have been employed at the Center for Communications (a subdivision of the Institute for Defense Analysis) at La Jolla and Princeton and two are at the National Security Agency. Program alumni have been employed at Google, Microsoft, IBM, AT&T, Facebook, Sun Microsystems, Dropbox, Ksplice, Quixey, Yelp, Khan Academy, and a variety of other software companies, and three have started their own companies."

Despite its importance, significant uncertainty remains about its effect on household food spending, nutrition, and well-being. This project will use new data from both government and private sources to measure these effects of SNAP and to inform economic models of household behavior. This project will not only help policymakers evaluate SNAP in its current state but will also contribute to evaluating the potential effect of proposed changes to the program's benefit levels and structure. The project's findings will be of interest to a broad community of policymakers, nonprofit organizations, and journalists. The project will contribute to the training of students in frontier methods for analyzing large-scale data and delivering insights for public policy.<br/><br/>The investigators will use comprehensive administrative data from the state of Rhode Island and detailed transaction records from a major retailer to study the effect of receipt of SNAP benefits on household behavior and well-being. This project will develop and implement three research designs for estimating the causal effect of SNAP receipt: an event-study approach based on fine timing, an instrumental variables approach based on the timing of certification periods, and a panel differences-in-differences approach based on legislated changes in benefit levels. The project will also develop economic models for interpreting the findings. The investigators will produce three academic articles for submission to peer-reviewed journals in economics and for presentation at academic seminars and conferences, as well as executive summaries for a broader community. The first article will study the effect of SNAP on food spending and will develop implications for the theory of consumer choice. The second article will study the effect of SNAP on nutrition and will develop implications for family health. The third article will study the effect of SNAP on administrative indicators of household well-being and will develop implications for the effectiveness of the program in mitigating the adverse consequences of poverty."

About 70 participants are anticipated, with about 35-40 contributed talks with no parallel sessions. The conference has been publicized through distribution lists, AMS and other mathematical event calendars, and related conference websites (the conference website is at https://pp2017.github.io/). <br/><br/>The conference will feature current research in the area of permutation patterns and its applications. Major themes in the conference include the structural theory of pattern classes, asymptotic behavior of pattern classes, generalized pattern avoidance, packing densities, and algorithmic and decidability problems. Research in the area is influenced by theoretical computer science, and traces its historical origins to the study of sorting machines. Combinatorial interest in permutation patterns focuses on centrally important enumeration and packing problems, for instance the extremal problem to determine how one pattern can be embedded as often as possible in a permutation. The statistics of permutations also enters into the picture, garnering attention from probabilists. The conference is expected to have a wide impact on a variety of different research areas in mathematics and computer science."

The purpose of this conference is twofold. First, it will set up a platform where new collaborative research projects can be started, current ones can be furthered, and completed ones can be reported on. Second, the meeting will take advantage of the Midwest's outstanding tradition in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry and contribute to this tradition by giving young mathematicians an opportunity to meet the leaders in the field and absorb the latest trends and techniques. Through a poster session, this meeting will help, in particular, with the transition from graduate student to academic employee. We will also disseminate new results discussed at the conference though a bundled publication. The journal ""Communications in Algebra"" will publish a special volume dedicated to this meeting. The award will be used primarily to fund young mathematicians, graduate students and recent postdocs.<br/><br/>The goal of this conference is to contribute to the training of scientists and to advance research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry by bringing together students, postdoctoral fellows, and more senior international experts. Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry are vibrant fields with rich and ever evolving interconnections. Local cohomology possesses intriguing ties with other areas of mathematics such as D-modules, interactions with the Frobenius morphism, hypergeometric differential equations and their solution sheaves, singularity invariants based on the de Rham functor, and big Cohen--Macaulay algebras. Recent discoveries have occurred that touch finiteness properties, the cohomology of Milnor fibers, the homological conjectures, and birational geometry.

It is critical that scientists understand the requirements concerning such collections in the countries in which they work.  This workshop will bring together U.S. scientists for the purpose of understanding the research implications of the Nagoya Protocol, which calls for sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources.  The Protocol aims to create greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources by establishing more predictable conditions for access to genetic resources, and helping to ensure benefit sharing when genetic resources leave the country.  Many researchers are unaware of the detailed requirements of the Protocol and the downstream expectations associated with the permits they have secured.  The knowledge gained by the scientific community through this workshop will ensure that research conducted internationally is done in a legally responsible manner. <br/><br/>During this two-day workshop, representatives from diverse professional biological societies will learn about the requirements of the Nagoya Protocol, explore its current effects on research, and identify issues that may affect biological research in the future. Government agency representatives, legal scholars, and researchers with direct knowledge about Protocol implications will present information critical to the biological researchers. The professional society leaders will then convey this information to their members through annual society meetings. Presentations will include not only the requirements of the Protocol and how to respond to them, but also case studies from researchers engaged in the field. Finally, participants will be invited to help develop a series of follow-on communications targeted for particular audiences (e.g., vice presidents for research, museum collections managers and curators, individual researchers) and/or particular topics (e.g., implications for specific subfields of biology), reducing the possibility that research will be hindered by lack of knowledge about country-specific requirements for benefit sharing."

Unfortunately, these ecosystems are threatened by disturbances such as sea-level rise, land-use change, nutrient runoff, and ocean acidification. Changes in the spatial and temporal dynamics of processes regulating carbon fluxes could ultimately dictate the role of these ecosystems as net sources or sinks of carbon. The project will provide new insights regarding the biological and physical processes that regulate carbon fluxes in tidal salt marshes. The project also has a significant educational component that will integrate minority Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math undergraduate and graduate students into research, educational, and outreach activities. Specifically, the project will empower underrepresented students by providing research and networking opportunities, and to enhance social capital by strengthening the network of students, science professionals, and researchers. An outdoor laboratory will be maintained at a tidal salt marsh at the St Jones Reserve in Delaware, and the carbon cycle in salt marshes will be used as the engaging phenomenon to provide real-world learning, so students can explore, examine, and use science ideas to explain the ecosystem functions of salt marshes.<br/><br/>This project will integrate multiple sensors and techniques to better understand the processes and timescales that control carbon fluxes in salt marshes. By combining a variety of measurements such as micrometeorological techniques, near-remote sensing of canopy phenology with discrete sampling techniques of sediment and water carbon dynamics, this project tackles three interrelated research objectives. The goal is to investigate ecological processes underlying vertical and lateral carbon fluxes in salt marshes: a) assess the influence of plant phenology on ecosystem scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes, b) elucidate the role of sediment CO2 and CH4 on ecosystem fluxes, and c) determine the influence of tides (i.e., neap vs. spring tides) on vertical and lateral carbon fluxes. The project will provide educational opportunities for 8th grade students and will be aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Finally, the outcomes of this project will provide a baseline for interaction with science professionals and policy makers through outreach activities in collaboration with ongoing state and national initiatives."

Of all the major animal groups, snails have the highest extinction rates, and most of these losses have occurred in the Pacific islands. Hawaii, a diversity hotspot, supports one of the world's most spectacular land snail radiations with more than 750 species and numerous species still unknown to science. However, the number of species is declining rapidly, and extinction estimates are already 50% or more. The Oahu Tree Snails (Achatinellidae) are the most diverse and iconic snails in the Hawaiian Islands. Research on these snails has contributed to development of evolutionary theory and island biology, yet basics about the biology and diversity of the group is still lacking. This project uses morphological, molecular, and biogeographic data from museum and recently collected specimens to clarify the taxonomy of this important land snail family, and provide insights into their evolution and conservation. Accurate and updated understanding of the identities and relationships of these snails is critical to the welfare of the ecosystem.  Training will be integrated throughout this project, ensuring the development of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The project will assess the systematics of the highly threatened and iconic Achatinellidae, providing a revised and updated classification that will be the foundation for a better understanding of their diversification and conservation. The project will provide training for one postdoctoral researcher, one Ph.D. student, and numerous university undergraduates and high schoolers while addressing the three primary research objectives: 1) produce revised and updated subfamily and generic monographs of the Hawaiian Achatinellidae, including descriptions of 13 new species; 2) develop the first comprehensive, Pacific-wide phylogenetic hypothesis for the Achatinellidae using a modern morphological and molecular approach; 3) assess the biogeographic history of the Hawaiian Achatinellidae and their conservation. High school, undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM will learn a range of techniques from molecular phylogenetics to anatomical analyses and museum curation and digitization, thereby linking science education with hands-on research, while growing and sustaining essential expertise in taxonomy. Trainees will be heavily involved in development of web-based products providing biogeographic, ecological and taxonomic data for each species, accessible to researchers and the public, and used to develop museum exhibits for broader access."

Metamaterials are often created by adding filler particles to a substrate, such as a polymeric material.  If the size, shape, and orientation of the filler particles can be precisely controlled, then macroscopic properties of the material such as its strength or stiffness, can be tailored in novel ways.  This project will use magnetic fields to control filler particles, such as magnetic microdisks that have been used in preliminary experiments. The project will develop theoretical models to help identify novel strategies for engineering composite materials. The experiments and theory will test the hypothesis that metamaterials can be designed on the sub-micron length scale by controlling the alignment time of submicron filler particles and the solidification of the composite.  Results from the project could help advance additive manufacturing by finding ways to vary properties spatially through a composite material.  The project will include development of new modules and hands-on activities for K-12 and college participants in a new course titled, ""Exploring the Magic of Physics via Hands-on Service Learning."" Furthermore, the research team will leverage the use of 3D printing capabilities in their laboratory to develop workshops on 3D modeling and printing for high-school students and teachers.<br/><br/>Composite metamaterials will be fabricated by aligning two-dimensional magnetic particles, i.e., disks, in Newtonian fluids while controlling the center of mass distribution of the particles. The size, shape, orientation, buoyancy, susceptibility, and concentration of the particles are each expected to influence alignment dynamics and the formation of disruptions, such as the particle chaining, which could lead to unwanted heterogeneity in the material.  The experiments will involve the use of new kind of magnetic tweezer apparatus for investigating alignment using a rotating magnetic field.  Two-particle interactions under various magnetic field conditions will be examined.  Then, the rheological properties of colloidal suspensions will be measured to determine influences of particle shape and orientation.  Strategies will be identified for magnetically aligning filler particles while preventing chain formation.  Then, an apparatus will be developed to systematically analyze control parameters during alignment and polymerization of bulk anisotropic composites.  Continuum-based theoretical descriptions for particle motions in viscous fluids in the presence of body forces will help interpret experimental data, provide insight into the design of filler particles, and guide precision engineering of advanced composites.  Nanocomposites with precisely aligned fillers will offer new opportunities for innovation in creating advanced biomaterial, optical, electromagnetic, and membrane technologies."

Many volcanoes, especially the most destructive ones, undergo long slow oscillations in ground swelling, gas emissions and seismic activity, with periods between repeated peak activity of hours to days. Volcanoes may also experience tremor or shaking with much shorter periods of around one second. Such oscillations, with both day- and second-long periods, can last for weeks before an eruption occurs, and thus serve as important precursors to volcanic disasters. Understanding the cause for these oscillations is therefore critical for forecasting these disasters as well as for advancing the science of how volcanoes work. This project seeks to unify two leading physical models for both the slow ultra-long, i.e., day-long, period oscillations and volcanic tremor, with second-long oscillation periods. Our model explains long-period oscillations in terms of slowly ascending magma waves of gas pulses in the magma-filled volcanic conduit, which arrive sequentially at the surface, causing ground swelling and other activity such as small earthquakes. The shorter-period tremors are explained by a magma wagging mechanism in which the heavy column of magma in the volcanic conduit wags side-to-side inside of a spongy jacket of extra-bubbly magma. However, very-long and shorter period oscillations are not independent of each other; for example, long period oscillations involve cycles of enhanced volcanic tremor activity. The main goal of this project is to develop a 3-D (three-dimensional) model of bubbly magma in a volcanic conduit to account for the full range of oscillatory behavior, from rapid tremor to ultra-slow cycles. The central hypothesis of this study is that the evolution of magma waves in 3-D influences the onset of magma-wagging motion; this potentially provides a prediction for how long-period oscillations evolve and trigger (and sustain) shorter-period volcanic tremor prior to an eruption. The project also involves development of fundamental theories of two-phase physics that will, in addition to its impact on volcanic hazards, may contribute to better understanding of other problems of geological, environmental and energy-related processes.<br/><br/>The models of magma waves and magma wagging are built from the same physics of two-phase systems,; the processes these models describe are inevitably coupled and influence each other's behavior. For example, degassing activity during long period cycles correlates with tremor, and our models suggest that gas emissions help drive tremor activity. Moreover, the current magma-wave model accounts for only vertical motion in one dimension, while the present magma-wagging model treats only horizontal movement in one-dimension. However, new preliminary models already suggest that the magma wagging entails circular swirling motion that can be detected from seismic stations. Magma waves are also likely to develop three-dimensional shapes, like spherical pockets near the center of the volcanic conduit, or stretched out bands near the conduit wall; these wave shapes would then affect how the magma column wags side to side. Accordingly, the primary activity of this proposal is to (1) develop the 3-D two-phase analytic theories of magma waves and magma wagging, including new physics such as gas exsolution and variable viscosity; (2) develop a 3-D unified numerical model of fully coupled magma wave and wagging evolution and activity; and (3) test the model predictions against new laboratory experiments, as well as existing seismological, ground-motion and gas-flux data, including recent observations from a pilot project in a volcano in Mexico. The goal of this work is to provide physical understanding and, ideally, model forecasting with a unified theory for the cause and evolution of long and short period oscillations, leading up to explosive volcanic eruptions. The magma wave and magma wagging models form the essential building blocks for a complete model of long and shorter period oscillations prior to volcanic eruption. The extension of these models into three-dimensions with more sophisticated physics, and their eventual unification into a single numerical model, will provide a wealth of predictions to further test the model with lab experiments as well as existing and new data. The model will provide insight into the dynamics and evolution of the volcanic magma column prior to an eruption, as well as a potentially important prognostic tool for volcanic hazards."

Structural changes can be the consequence of technical progress, changes in preference, or policy regime shifts.   Structural changes imply unstable relationships among economic variables.  What underlines factor models is that a few common shocks can explain the co-movement of a large number of economic variables, so that information in a high dimensional data set can be summarized by a small number of common factors.  Recently, factor models without permitting structural changes have been widely used in macroeconomics and finance.  However, structural changes have important consequences when ignored but provide considerable benefits when appropriately accounted for given their presence.  Therefore, practitioners have to be cautious about the potential structural changes in economic datasets. This concern is empirically relevant because model instability is a pervasive phenomenon for economic data.  This project considers how to conduct inference about structural changes in high dimensional factor models.  The research results are useful in evaluating the effectiveness of a policy change, in identifying regime shifts in consumer preferences, and in constructing better forecasts of economic activity.  <br/><br/>Inference for structural changes in high dimensional factor models is a challenging problem because both factors and factor loadings are unobservable, making classical analysis not applicable. The investigator will develop econometric methods that simultaneously estimate the factors, factor loadings, and the break points. Both small and large magnitudes of breaks will be studied. This project aims to answer critical questions arising from structural changes in high dimensional factor models: Under what magnitude of breaks can the break points be identified? How can researchers characterize the randomness of the estimated break points? Does there exist a limiting distribution for the estimated break points, and if so, what form does the limiting distribution take? Can the onset of a new regime be quickly identified without waiting for many observations from the new regime? The latter question is relevant for datasets with a large cross section but a small number of time periods.  This project provides a general framework to answer these questions."

Because compost is generally used as fertilizer, urban agriculture has the potential to recycle nutrients from food waste back into the human food system.  However, the availability of nutrients in compost may not match the nutrient demands of crop production, and imbalanced or excessive application of compost could lead to losses of nutrients through leachate or runoff.  In some cases, urban agriculture could be a contributor to the pollution of groundwater or surface water.  Additionally, changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation have the potential to affect nutrient loss rates from urban farm plots.  Although nutrient dynamics in conventional agriculture have been well studied, little is known about controls on nutrient cycling in urban agriculture, which occurs at a different scale and is subject to different management strategies.  This research will quantify and contextualize the role of urban agriculture on nutrient dynamics within the Twin Cities, Minnesota urban ecosystem.  Project results will be shared with local policy-makers as well as with the scientific community.  Approximately 140 undergraduate students will be engaged in project activities each year through courses, and this project will provide intensive research experiences for approximately 15 undergraduate students and 5 high school interns.<br/><br/>This project will combine data collection from urban farms and community gardens, and experimental manipulations across study plots at the University of St. Thomas, Minnesota.  The observational component will characterize the range and frequency of different soil management techniques, and to assess how these different management strategies result in different levels of nutrient use efficiency and nutrient export.  Researchers will construct nutrient budgets for ten urban farms based on information collected from farm managers on compost application and produce yield, and will collect additional data on soil and leachate nutrient levels.  Additionally, researchers will use a controlled, replicated experiment, using 96 four square meter raised bed plots, to measure the effects of compost type and application rate, and simulated rainfall intensity, on nutrient use efficiency and loss via leachate.  Finally, statistical models based on these results will be used to estimate cumulative nutrient fluxes from urban agriculture at the city scale, under current and future scenarios.<br/>"

Compared with larger fragments, small fragments are often extreme environments because they can experience stresses like higher temperatures, more light, and lower soil moisture. This research looks at how plants living in different sized fragments are affected by their pathogens. Interactions between plants and their pathogens are important because although pathogens are best known for the damage they cause they can also help preserve biological diversity. This is because each plant species has its own unique group of pathogens that specialize on it, and slows growth or kills just the plants they infect. This can keep any single plant species from dominating in an area. However, not all pathogens can thrive in the extreme environments found in small patches. It may be that in small patches, different types of pathogens that slow growth or kill multiple plant species indiscriminately are more common. If this is the case, they could decrease plant diversity compared with large patches. By uncovering how plants and pathogens interact in different patch sizes this work will be relevant for understanding the biodiversity consequences of breaking up natural areas, and may affect management of natural landscapes. Both lead researchers for this project are early-career faculty at undergraduate colleges, and will incorporate undergraduate students into all aspects of this work, including community outreach.<br/><br/>Three parallel studies will be conducted to assess how plant-pathogen interactions are altered by landscape fragmentation, focusing on fungal pathogens in particular. First, researchers will bury seeds of twelve plant species in patches of different sizes at the Kansas Fragmentation Site, allowing the seeds to be colonized by potential pathogens and testing to see if the seeds remain viable after a year of burial. This will determine if seed mortality due to fungal pathogens is most influenced by ecological factors that vary with patch size, such as plant host density, plant species richness, and microclimatic conditions (such as temperature and soil moisture). Second, the fungal community from these buried seeds will be characterized using both culture-based methods and culture-independent molecular tools. This will determine whether fungal community structure varies predictably with patch size, host identity, and host density. Finally, a combination of greenhouse and field experiments will test the hypothesis that negative feedbacks (when plants ""culture"" host-specific pathogens in the soil surrounding their roots) are strongest in the interiors of large patches, rather than on the edges of large patches or in small patches. It is predicted that thermally stressful environments on edges and small patches will favor generalist fungi, reducing the influence of diversity-maintaining feedbacks on smaller fragments. Collectively, these studies link individual plant-fungal interactions to observed landscape patterns in plant diversity."

Moreover, relating these changes to the psychology of decision making is even more challenging, but important to understand to predict and explain behavior. In particular, brain activity can vary in relationship to the speed of a behavioral response, but these variations are difficult to measure systematically.  The goal of this project is to measure brain electrical activity together with behavioral data in order to develop new methods to statistically model the relationships and to aid in detection of subtle brain changes occurring with behavior.  The project will result in a new method for analyzing these complex relationships and allow for better combination of different forms of data generally.  This will provide a more accurate view of the effect of experimental manipulations and treatments.  All analytic procedures will be extensively documented along with the experimental data and these will be freely available online.  <br/><br/>A crucial tool in this project is the new technique of joint modeling of behavioral and physiological data. An advantage of joint modeling that has thus far been underexploited is the capacity to construct genuine neurocognitive models that are informed by both behavioral and neural data. Indeed, joint estimation opens up the possibility to construct new models whose parameters are only estimable given more than one type of information. This project will lead to the development of a multimodal sequential accumulation model that makes predictions about the combination of reaction time, accuracy, and EEG data, and that allows for conclusions not possible from either type of data individually. Specifically, the project involves experimental studies to generate data that will, in combination with the new statistical framework, allow the disentanglement of parameters of a cognitive model that cannot be estimated without the use of both neural and behavioral data. The parametric neurocognitive model will involve specific neural markers that connect behavioral parameters to EEG activity measures. The newly collected data will also provide a direct test of the classical modeling assumption that visual encoding, decision-making, and executing a motor response are sequential processes."

Despite such widespread harm, many questions remain about what characteristics of invaders allow them to spread. Among invasive species, social insects are more harmful due to their large colony sizes and cooperative behaviors. One trait, the ability to form groups containing multiple queens, is shared by several of the most devastating invasive social insects, including Argentine ants, fire ants, and yellowjacket wasps. Combining an experiment, behavioral observations, and genetic analyses, our research asks why and how invasive yellowjacket wasps form multi-queen colonies. This project will compare native populations, where most colonies have a single queen and persist for one year, to invasive populations, where colonies contain multiple queens, grow to very large sizes, and may persist for several years. This system provides an ideal opportunity to study multi-queen societies and to identify strengths and weaknesses of this strategy. This research will also inform efforts to control invasive wasps. The research supports educational opportunities for students and will benefit society by providing basic information on the factors influencing invasiveness of non-native species.<br/><br/>Although societies composed of non-relatives occur in many organisms, the drivers of the transition from simple family-based social groups to more complex social organization remain enigmatic. Yellowjackets (Vespula spp.) present a fascinating model system because the transition to multi-queen, perennial colonies has occurred recently and convergently in different invasive populations. This incipient phenotype offers a window into the dynamic processes underlying early stages of a major evolutionary transition. Using a three-pronged approach, this project will shed new light on the requeening process. Requeening distinguishes the multi-queen, perennial colonies found in the invasive range from the single-queen, annual colonies that occur in most of the native range. First, in field trials, mated queens will be experimentally introduced to colony entrances to directly test the behavioral response and gene expression profiles of queens and workers from both native and invasive populations. If workers in multi-queen colonies are more likely to accept new queens, they should display decreased aggression toward introduced queens compared to workers from single-queen colonies. In parallel, genes known to mediate aggression in other insects should be differentially expressed in the brains of workers and queens during queen introduction in the single- versus multi-queen colonies. Additional regulatory differences between these two social contexts will be identified. Second, the genetic structure of colonies will be surveyed successively in the invasive habitat to determine when in the colony life cycle requeening occurs, relatedness among co-occurring queens, and to estimate the longevity of founding and joining queens. Finally, reproductive partitioning in multi-queen, polygynous colonies will be assessed by genotyping hundreds of age-matched brood. Understanding the interactions between colony queen number, queen longevity and reproductive partitioning will provide novel insights into the selective forces that mediate this major evolutionary transition and, in this system, a harmful invasive phenotype."

In many economic contexts, the available data contain relatively little usable information about the relationships of economic interest, or are poorly described by available econometric models.  In such cases, existing techniques for inference can be unreliable, and researchers using these techniques risk drawing spurious conclusions about relationships among economic variables and the likely effects of proposed policies.  This project develops new techniques for reliable inference in such settings, allowing researchers to more accurately quantify uncertainty about economic relationships and policy proposals.  To increase the impact of this research, the investigator organizes, records, and publicly posts a series of lectures discussing the proposed methods, and also posts code for the methods developed to publicly accessible software repositories.  Further, the investigator participates in a mentoring program for graduate students from underrepresented minority backgrounds organized by the American Economic Association.<br/><br/>The project consists of four components.  The first component uses tools from differential geometry to study weak identification-robust inference in instrumental variables models with heterogeneous treatment effects, closing an important gap in the existing literature on identification-robust inference.  The second component derives optimal tests and estimators for moment equality models with potential identification failure, using a novel family of integrated likelihoods which integrate out a prior on a functional nuisance parameter.  The third component shows that by exploiting structure common to many partially-identified moment inequality applications one can obtain powerful, computationally simple inference for low-dimensional parameters of interest.  The fourth and final component considers locally misspecified models, develops a connection between inference under local misspecification and inference under weak identification, and proposes techniques which allow misspecification-robust inference on structural or causal parameters of interest."

How the eye functions depends on the ecological and the biological characteristics of the organism, such as whether particular species are nocturnal, live underground, or metamorphose, e.g., the transition from a tadpole to adult frog. This project uses frogs as a model group of species to investigate the evolution of vision, by integrating information on the morphology, genetics, and physiology of these organisms. Results from the project will provide insight into the role that vision systems play in the evolution of novel, adaptive solutions to new environmental challenges, a topic of primary importance in understanding causes of species diversification throughout the tree of life. To achieve these goals, this project relies on international collaboration to sample frogs from across the globe. Undergraduate researchers will receive research training and aid in producing the scientific results. This project will leverage the outreach of two major public museums to disseminate the new discoveries to the general public via exhibits and educational e-books.<br/><br/>This project integrates morphological, molecular, and spectral data to investigate the evolution of vision systems in frogs at both ancient and recent timescales. Molecular evolutionary studies will provide a genomic perspective on vision evolution with the expectation that visually-oriented frogs exhibit greater levels of natural selection, gene duplication, and retention of vision genes. Characterizing the physiology and molecular underpinnings of vision in species with aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial adults will reveal how the visual system adapts to distinct visual environments during metamorphosis. These broad studies will provide a framework for more focused investigations that target transitions in natural history characteristics. Using the hyperdiverse African reed frogs, this project will test whether the evolution of bright coloration is associated with visual system diversity that maximizes species recognition. Finally, this project will investigate how transitions to life below ground have shaped the morphological and genetic components of visual systems with the expectation that eye reduction accompanies a reduction in use or inactivation of vision genes. This project takes an integrative approach that will provide detailed and comprehensive insight into vision evolution across life history transitions to address a central gap in our overall understanding of vertebrate vision evolution."

Of all the major animal groups, snails have the highest extinction rates, and most of these losses have occurred in the Pacific islands. Hawaii, a diversity hotspot, supports one of the world's most spectacular land snail radiations with more than 750 species and numerous species still unknown to science. However, the number of species is declining rapidly, and extinction estimates are already 50% or more. The Oahu Tree Snails (Achatinellidae) are the most diverse and iconic snails in the Hawaiian Islands. Research on these snails has contributed to development of evolutionary theory and island biology, yet basics about the biology and diversity of the group is still lacking. This project uses morphological, molecular, and biogeographic data from museum and recently collected specimens to clarify the taxonomy of this important land snail family, and provide insights into their evolution and conservation. Accurate and updated understanding of the identities and relationships of these snails is critical to the welfare of the ecosystem.  Training will be integrated throughout this project, ensuring the development of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The project will assess the systematics of the highly threatened and iconic Achatinellidae, providing a revised and updated classification that will be the foundation for a better understanding of their diversification and conservation. The project will provide training for one postdoctoral researcher, one Ph.D. student, and numerous university undergraduates and high schoolers while addressing the three primary research objectives: 1) produce revised and updated subfamily and generic monographs of the Hawaiian Achatinellidae, including descriptions of 13 new species; 2) develop the first comprehensive, Pacific-wide phylogenetic hypothesis for the Achatinellidae using a modern morphological and molecular approach; 3) assess the biogeographic history of the Hawaiian Achatinellidae and their conservation. High school, undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM will learn a range of techniques from molecular phylogenetics to anatomical analyses and museum curation and digitization, thereby linking science education with hands-on research, while growing and sustaining essential expertise in taxonomy. Trainees will be heavily involved in development of web-based products providing biogeographic, ecological and taxonomic data for each species, accessible to researchers and the public, and used to develop museum exhibits for broader access."

The educational goals of this REU will be accomplished through a multidisciplinary approach using simulations, imaging, and modeling as a common thread. The popularity of computational research models has increased due to limited use of human subjects and animals.  Furthermore, as the trend towards personalized medicine spurs the development and refinement of models across scales from cells, to organs, to entire systems, multiscale modeling is becoming integrated into clinical decision support. Exposing REU students to innovative research will increase their awareness about graduate school and ultimately increase the STEM graduate school pipeline. The proposed REU program will also strengthen their STEM career paths and increase student's identities as scientists or engineers, and improve their communication skills. The student research projects have the potential to substantially improve the development of models in biomedical engineering which will reduce reliance on human and animal data, and expedite innovation. These models will have many different applications, for example: calculating loads acting on the human body during movement, simulating tasks that cannot safely be performed by experimental subjects, and simulating blood flow through vessels. Additional benefits from this program include improved connections to faculty at ECU partner institutions. Through the REU program students will be exposed to cutting edge research utilizing advanced computational models with applications in biomedical engineering.<br/><br/>The goal of the BME-SIM program is to provide a quality research experience to students, especially those who have limited opportunities for research at their home institution or come from groups underrepresented in science and engineering.

Interactive simulation of elastic deformable objects such as fabric and soft tissue, in particular, has a direct benefit for apparel design, e-commerce, and medical training, where it can enable efficient and accurate previewing of garment designs or surgical actions.  But for simulation techniques to be truly valuable in these applications (so that they influence real life decisions), they must be visually representative of the behavior of the real phenomenon, including emergent fine-scale features such as wrinkles and folds, which must be reliably and faithfully reproduced as they convey information about the underlying physical properties of the material.  Because direct high-resolution simulation is too expensive for visual applications, many techniques have been developed to represent the details efficiently, including adaptive refinement and procedural synthesis.  Both types of methods depend crucially on being able to determine whether the current simulation resolution is inadequate to resolve the fine-scale detail that should exist in the system.  To do so, one must predict when such detail is likely to emerge, and how it will evolve over time.  Unfortunately, existing criteria for doing this rely either on expensive a posteriori error estimation, or on heuristic approaches requiring careful manual parameter tuning to generate reliable results.  This research aims to make progress towards the goal of robust and versatile physics-based techniques that can accurately predict the formation of unresolved fine-scale features and characterize their behavior as the simulation proceeds.  The versatile framework for detail prediction developed in this work will make visual simulation more efficient, reliable, and representative of the true behavior of the depicted phenomenon, stimulating its adoption in applications such as apparel design and surgical planning and training.  The PI will transfer project outcomes to practitioners in both these fields through collaboration with design faculty and surgeons in his University; this will additionally train computer science students in interdisciplinary research through interactions with experts in design and surgery.  Applications of this work in visual arts, design, and medicine will be used for outreach, and to engage art and design students who would not otherwise be attracted to STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project will address a fundamental challenge in numerical simulation: how can one efficiently characterize unresolved detail in a simulated physical system?  Previous work by the PI has pointed to dynamical instabilities as an essential criterion to predict the emergence of fine-scale features.  This work will build a theoretical and computational framework that formalizes this insight, and provides efficient and practical techniques for capturing emergent detail in the simulation of deformable objects.  The contribution of the work will be a framework of novel numerical methods that can automatically detect and characterize dynamical instabilities in a general setting.  Doing so will extend the versatility of a priori refinement techniques, making them applicable to a broad class of elastic simulation problems.  The proposed methods will be evaluated on practical problems arising in applications such as garment design and virtual surgery.  The knowledge gained from this work will advance understanding of quantitative and qualitative fidelity in simulations of dynamical systems, and will provide a sound theoretical foundation for future work on adaptive simulation."

This project proposes to overcome current limitations in this type of cancer therapy and meet the general challenge of controlling angiogenesis by tackling a more difficult, ""big-data""-like problem: understanding how combinations of proteins control angiogenesis. This project will tackle the problem by: 1) experimentally determining important protein characteristics; 2) determining mathematical equations that describe the behaviors of these proteins; and 3) developing computer simulations that include both the experimental data and the mathematical equations to determine how the proteins work to cause angiogenesis.   The education and outreach portion of this project will introduce sophomores to research and computer modeling in an introductory-level course in order to excite them about STEM.  The activities will include mentoring of underrepresented students to increase their interest and persistence within STEM majors.<br/><br/>The directed control of angiogenesis remains a pressing need due to its involvement in the pathology of over 70 diseases. A promising approach for angiogenesis control involves going beyond the traditional emphasis on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) axis towards a new focus: cross-axis signaling (protein binding across families). The objective in this project is to pioneer a shift towards understanding cross-axis angiogenic signaling via three aims grounded in quantitative biology (qBio),  omputational biology (cBio), and integrative systems biology (sBio).  Quantitative biology will be used to measure cross-axis binding and concentrations or relevant protein ligands, including through the development of new quantitative tools for multiplex measurement of receptor concentrations. Computational biology will be used to construct validated cross-axis models that will predict how adapter activation contributes to angiogenic hallmarks, cell proliferation, and migration.  Systems biology will be used to predict the role of cross-axis signaling in angiogenesis by applying the qBio and cBio tools to angiogenesis in vitro. Ligand, receptor, and adapter<br/>concentrations will be measured, and the magnitude of cross-axis signaling will be predicted. These predictions will be validated by<br/>demonstrating control of vessel formation (inhibition and stimulation) in vitro.  This research will be integrated with teaching by creating undergraduate research pathways via a core course. This will introduce systems biology to sophomore students who will develop computational models of ligand-receptor signaling in angiogenesis.  Students will also be offered opportunities to continue their work within the PI's research laboratory. Additional mentoring will be provided to underrepresented students to support their persistence within STEM fields."

Scientists call these lifetime movements ""dispersal"". While short-distance dispersal is common, long-distance dispersal is rare. Long-distance dispersal, however, plays an important role in nature -- it can help species survive when their habitat is destroyed, and can spread genes that they need to adapt to new conditions. Long-distance dispersal can also allow invasive species to spread quickly, leading to significant management costs and threatening native species. Scientists do not fully understand the factors that cause differences in dispersal distance, in part because it is difficult to track long-distance dispersers. This research will help people understand the causes and consequences of differences in dispersal distance by focusing on a salamander that lives in small, mountain streams. Because salamanders disperse along streams, and because even long-distance dispersers don't go very far (less than 500 meters), it is possible to collect information on dispersal (distance, timing, conditions before and after) that would be difficult and expensive to collect in other species. With this information, scientists and managers can better promote dispersal by native species, or prevent dispersal by invasive species. <br/><br/>This research will test whether dispersal distance affects individual performance (survival and growth), and how environmental factors (habitat stability and predation) influence those effects. The researcher will then test whether individual performance consequences predict population-level variation in dispersal distances (i.e., dispersal kernels), associated morphological, behavioral, and physiological phenotypes, and emergent patterns of population connectivity and range expansion. Because the research questions center on fundamental performance consequences, scaling relationships, and biogeographic processes, results will be informative across taxa. In particular, this work will help bridge plant and animal studies of dispersal by filling a common gap in our understanding of the scaling of dispersal data -- from individual traits to population-level dispersal distributions, and further to landscape and biogeographic consequences."

Ocean sediment accumulates over time as debris from adjacent continents, atmospheric dust, and the skeletons of microscopic marine organisms settle on the seafloor.  As sediment accumulates in the oceans surrounding Antarctica, it records past environmental conditions including ice sheet behavior as the ice retreated following the last Ice Age.  Scientists use a variety of chemical analyses to determine how long ago sediments were deposited on the seafloor, and are therefore able to relate ice sheet behavior to specific periods of time in the past.  However, it has been challenging to determine the age of sediments around Antarctica, because the sediments often lack material that can be dated by conventional methods. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of Washington will test newly developed methods for dating Antarctic continental margin sediments and refine the timing of ice retreat since the last Ice Age. Ultimately, accurately assessing the timing of Antarctic ice retreat from marine sediment cores will enable a better understanding of Earth's response to changing environmental conditions.  This project includes training of a Ph.D. student at the University of South Florida, producing videos for educators in the state of Florida, and public outreach at the annual St. Petersburg Science Fest.  <br/><br/>Antarctic margin sediments are difficult to accurately date because the calcium carbonate shells of marine organisms that are typically used throughout the world's oceans to date sediments are not often preserved. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of Washington focus on two tasks:  1) separating less thermochemically-stable carbon (more likely derived from carbon with an age equal to the depositional age of the sediment) from more stable carbon (more likely eroded from the adjacent continent by glacial erosion); and 2) isolating specific organic compounds from marine diatoms, which are primary producers in the Southern Ocean.  The work will use previously collected samples in sediment cores obtained from the Southern Ocean seafloor.  At each depth horizon in each sediment core studied, scientists will use established radiocarbon methods to date the carbon derived from each of these new preparation techniques. This work will determine the best practices in radiocarbon dating of carbonate-poor Antarctic sediments, which will ultimately improve understanding of the factors influencing past and future Antarctic ice sheet behavior."

For example, by taking into account the effects of nonlinear averaging (Jensen's inequality), thermal performance curves constructed under static conditions have been used to forecast biological consequences of changes in temperature mean and variance. However, this mathematical approach overlooks several important factors: (1) Compensatory physiological mechanisms may modify the strictly mathematical predictions of performance. For example, brief exposure to stressful temperatures can prime physiology for future events. (2) Environmental variation in nature is often unpredictable, particularly when rare, extreme events are considered. However, this unpredictability only rarely has been considered empirically.

The results of these interactions could be synergistic or antagonistic depending on the underlying physiology.

Current work by the National Cancer Institute has not combined radiation exposure estimates with publicly available U.S. Vital Statistics and public health data. The project fills this research gap and provides important insights into the direct effect of these tests upon American health.

The investigator also examines whether radiation deposition from atmospheric tests between 1951 and 1958 resulted in considerable damage to the agricultural sector. Studying adaptive responses to this damage provides insight into how agricultural policy shapes agricultural investment and responses to adverse events.<br/><br/>The investigator uses reduced-form econometric methods to provide a rigorous empirical account of the external damage caused by domestic atmospheric testing. This research methodology uses exogenous within-county variation in fallout patterns across years to measure the causal relationship between radioactive pollution and outcomes of interest. Using annual data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service and U.S. Agricultural Censuses, the investigator measures the direct effects of fallout on agricultural productivity and the adjustments made in response to these productivity shocks. The previous studies on the health consequences of radiation exposure from tests have focused primarily on identifying cancer risks among downwind populations and extrapolating out to the general population. This project uses national variation in fallout patterns and mortality to identify the causal relationship between fallout and public health. Using this methodology, the investigator measures not only the geographic extent of the harm, but also the temporal effect of radiation exposure upon regional mortality patterns. Through U.S. Vital Statistics and the Multiple Cause of Death data, this project identifies the causal channels driving the increase in crude deaths more accurately."

While the goal of models in the language sciences is to provide universal explanations, the bulk of research is still conducted on English and other majority languages. Moreover, research in the language sciences -- despite growing awareness of the need for diversity -- is largely carried out by practitioners from majority language communities. This is problematic for two distinct reasons: findings are not representative of the increasingly diverse US population and neither are researchers, clinicians and educators.  This 29-week Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program addresses these two issues by equipping 14 undergraduate students per year from under-represented communities with the skills and knowledge required to become successful in graduate programs focused on speech, language and communication sciences and in working with members of linguistic minorities. The program will include six key modules: (i) Establishment of a community of scholars through active participation in academic seminars, (ii) Mentored Scientific research, (iii) Research Ethics training, (iv) Research dissemination, (v) Participation in workshops to prepare a graduate school application portfolio, (vi) Organization of a translational conference for students, professionals and community leaders. <br/><br/>Recruiting students who use lesser-studied languages, spoken and signed, and non-mainstream varieties of English, and having them conduct research with Mentoring Faculty who are experts in the various fields related to language sciences (Theoretical Linguistics, First and Second Language Acquisition and Processing, Bilingualism, Speech, Language and Communication Sciences, Developmental and Acquired Disorders) applied to lesser studied varieties of English and other languages, constitutes an important step toward redressing the imbalance and ensuring that the field will benefit from the scholarly study of the linguistic and cultural diversity found in New York City. The program will benefit from both the tremendous ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of Brooklyn and Queens, in the recruitment of student participants as well as project participants, and the nine mentors' state-of-the-art research facilities that include university-based laboratories such as Long Island University Downtown Brooklyn Speech-Language-Hearing Clinic, Brooklyn College Linguistics Laboratory, the City University of New York Graduate Center Developmental Neurolinguistics Laboratory as well as off-campus sites including the Endangered Language Alliance, Haskins Laboratory and YVY Research Institute located in a Head Start program that serves 3,000 children speaking 15 distinct languages.  This REU program thus serves two purposes: to involve undergraduates in research projects that can be expected to contribute publishable results and novel data sets that will be made available to the field through open-access websites, while simultaneously encouraging and preparing minority students to undertake graduate work on diverse languages and cultures.

It provides a natural laboratory to study a volcanic system that has been in a continuous state of activity with a persistent lava lake over at least the last 40 years. Worldwide only four other volcanoes with such long-lived lava lakes exist: Erta Ale, Ethiopia; Kilauea, Hawaii; Nyiragongo, Congo; and Ambrym, Vanuatu. These volcanoes are a rare anomaly that provide a window into the underlying magmatic system and behavior. Erebus is of particular interest as it cycles through phases of very explosive activity every 20 thousand years. This project will investigate interactions between the magmatic system, the rift it is located in, and the impact of the gravitational load the volcano imposes on the underlying crust and its own magmatic system. Possible interactions between these factors may explain the changes in activity. The project will analyze geophysical data that have been collected at Erebus over at least the last two decades. The results of this work will be available to the public and scientific community and inform geodynamic models in this region. The project funds an early-career scientist and a graduate student at New Mexico Tech and contributes to the development of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The proposed work targets scientific questions recently formulated by the community during the 2016 NSF-sponsored Scientific Drivers and Future of Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory workshop. The location and geometry of the magmatic plumbing from vent to lower crust system remain poorly constrained, particularly below 1 km depth. The style and causes for changes in volcanic and magmatic activity over the short term (minutes to hours) and on the decadal scale remains enigmatic. Two decades of campaign and continuous GPS data on Ross Island will inform about the longer term dynamics of both, Ross Island growing within the Terror Rift, and Erebus? deeper magmatic system. This project will organize and analyze all existing GPS data for Ross Island, and interpret any anomalies in the resulting time series. These activities require organization, consistent processing and interpretation/modeling of the existing ~20 years of GPS data, which include campaign, continuous, and high-rate GPS observations. We will generate these position time series in a consistent local reference frame and make the results, including models of transient deformation available to the community. Volcanic, tectonic and isostatic adjustment related deformation will be modeled to place Erebus in a broad volcano-tectonic framework of West Antarctica. During the data analysis phase, the utility of existing GPS data for reflection studies of snow and sea-level dynamics will also be evaluated."

A key tool in this research is a ""dynamic wetting"" (DW) apparatus, which can create films of liquids of controlled thicknesses from single nanometers to several microns (25 millionths of an inch to a few thousandths of an inch). By measuring the absorption of light (especially infrared light) as the film thickness is systematically varied, chemical and structural information about the molecules nearest the surface can be deduced. The information and insights gained from this research have impacts in other fields of chemistry research, as well as applied technologies such as catalysis, corrosion, lubrication, and semiconductor processing. This research project is also serving as a vehicle for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in physical chemistry, laser technology, and computational science. Outreach activities include Professor Shaw's Rural Scholars Program, which engages aspiring undergraduate students from rural areas in genuine laboratory research experiences.<br/><br/><br/>The experimental strategy employed in the Shaw laboratory is developed around the dynamic wetting (DW) technique, which creates molecular fluids films with controlled thicknesses from about one monolayer to nearly 10 microns thickness. This approach circumvents difficulties in direct observation of the interface by selectively excluding opaque, bulk phases, and allows detailed descriptions of interface formation and behaviors. The net molecular orientation and the absolute thickness of the fluid films are extracted by sum-frequency generation (SFG), infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) with polarization modulation (PM-IRRAS), Raman spectroscopy, and variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. The experimental spectra are used to benchmark and validate computational and fluid dynamic models of interfacial molecular structure. Ultimately, this research may lead to an understanding of the roles of intermolecular forces and geometric confinement in creating chemical interfaces at defined distances from surfaces, advancing fundamental research in lubrication, tribology, and heterogeneous catalysis."

However, we are increasingly aware that the ocean does things for us as humans (e.g. by providing seafood, and even the oxygen we breath that comes from the activity of billions of marine phytoplankton), and further, that these ocean services are threatened by changes in ocean chemistry because of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. To expand our knowledge about the vulnerability of marine ecosystems, the goal of this project is to study the resilience of marine organisms to environmental change by examining the tolerance of their early stages (embryos and larvae) to stresses in the ocean such as higher temperatures and changes in ocean chemistry. The study organism of this project is the purple sea urchin, a common marine invertebrate found on the California coast. Although this might seem like an odd choice, purple urchins have been model study organisms in developmental biology and scientists know a great deal about their embryos' development. For the project, the researchers will use molecular biology tools, some that were developed in human cancer biology, to determine how the timing of gene expression can improve the success of embryos and larvae in the face of environmental stress. New insight from this project will likely shed some light, and some hope, on how, and how fast, marine organisms can adjust to changes in their marine environment. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study the ""genome to phenome"" concept, and to investigate mechanisms that contribute to rapid shifts in organismal physiological capacities in response to environmental change, processes that would operate on ecological rather than evolutionary time scales. The model system is the early life-history stages of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and the PIs will focus on two processes: intragenerational plasticity and transgenerational plasticity (TGP) where they will specifically interrogate epigenetic mechanisms that may alter gene expression in early stage urchins on a rapid time scale. For the environment-organism interaction, the PIs will focus on co-occurring multiple abiotic factors (pCO2, oxygen and temperature) that are ecologically relevant, are highly variable in the purple urchin nearshore habitat, and are projected to change drastically in future climate change scenarios. The project will explore ecological epigenomics in a global change context. Methodologically, the PIs plan to do the following: (1) raise cultures of sea urchins at variable pCO2 and temperature conditions followed by assays to test physiological tolerances of the progeny (growth, metabolic rate and lipid content), (2) use two screening assays for global patterns of DNA methylation: an ELISA-based method that measures levels of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) in samples of genomic DNA, and the methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) assay, (4) use RNA-Seq to assess gene expression patterns, and (5) perform concurrent profiling of the larval transcriptome and methylome using Illumina sequencing technology, in this case, RNA-Seq combined with whole genome bisulfite methylation sequencing."

Ocean sediment accumulates over time as debris from adjacent continents, atmospheric dust, and the skeletons of microscopic marine organisms settle on the seafloor.  As sediment accumulates in the oceans surrounding Antarctica, it records past environmental conditions including ice sheet behavior as the ice retreated following the last Ice Age.  Scientists use a variety of chemical analyses to determine how long ago sediments were deposited on the seafloor, and are therefore able to relate ice sheet behavior to specific periods of time in the past.  However, it has been challenging to determine the age of sediments around Antarctica, because the sediments often lack material that can be dated by conventional methods. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of Washington will test newly developed methods for dating Antarctic continental margin sediments and refine the timing of ice retreat since the last Ice Age. Ultimately, accurately assessing the timing of Antarctic ice retreat from marine sediment cores will enable a better understanding of Earth's response to changing environmental conditions.  This project includes training of a Ph.D. student at the University of South Florida, producing videos for educators in the state of Florida, and public outreach at the annual St. Petersburg Science Fest.  <br/><br/>Antarctic margin sediments are difficult to accurately date because the calcium carbonate shells of marine organisms that are typically used throughout the world's oceans to date sediments are not often preserved. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of Washington focus on two tasks:  1) separating less thermochemically-stable carbon (more likely derived from carbon with an age equal to the depositional age of the sediment) from more stable carbon (more likely eroded from the adjacent continent by glacial erosion); and 2) isolating specific organic compounds from marine diatoms, which are primary producers in the Southern Ocean.  The work will use previously collected samples in sediment cores obtained from the Southern Ocean seafloor.  At each depth horizon in each sediment core studied, scientists will use established radiocarbon methods to date the carbon derived from each of these new preparation techniques. This work will determine the best practices in radiocarbon dating of carbonate-poor Antarctic sediments, which will ultimately improve understanding of the factors influencing past and future Antarctic ice sheet behavior."

The project provides a vehicle for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry, optical physics, and materials science. A significant part of the undergraduates' involvement occurs through a collaboration with Austin Community College.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to establish the structure-function relationships that guide interfacial charge and energy transfer at two model organic semiconducting (OSC) interfaces: (1) squaraine dye:fullerene heterojunctions used to separate charge in organic photovoltaics, and (2) silicon and Indium-Gallium-Arsenic (InGaAs) surfaces that have been sensitized with singlet fission-capable acene molecules. To measure the electronic structure and dynamics of these interfaces, the Roberts groups is employing steady-state and time-resolved measurements based on an interface-specific technique, Electronic Sum Frequency Generation (ESFG). ESFG allows for selective viewing of energy and electron transfer at OSC interfaces. By using these spectroscopic methods in conjunction with conventional thin film characterization tools and material processing methods that can alter molecular packing at heterojunctions, the project allows the research group to establish structure-function relationships that can improve the efficiency of energy transfer and charge separation at buried OSC interfaces and potentially advances photovoltaic technologies."

As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. This project is a renewal REU Site at the University of North Texas (UNT). The Department of Political Science at the UNT runs this unique program to provide 30 undergraduate students (recruited from across the country) the opportunity to engage in graduate-level research in conflict management and peace science, in a senior faculty-mentored, in-residence, eight- week, Summer Research Experience that integrates training in civil conflict management with training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial analysis, and research ethics. In this program, student participants develop theoretical propositions that are tested empirically using geocoded data and report their findings in a national professional political science conference.  There is also training on research ethics incorporated as part of the program. Activities include workshops on theory development and research methodology, GIS, and the graduate school application process. There are also activities designed to build a sense of research community among students, faculty and graduate student mentors.  It is important to extend training in conflict management to all students, but particularly to populations historically underrepresented in higher education (which are growing as a proportion of the undergraduate student population). This program seeks to address the need to develop further expertise in conflict management and peace science by providing opportunities to engage in advanced empirical research to students who would not otherwise have such research opportunities. UNT is well positioned, both institutionally and geographically, to provide such access. To that end, the PI-team is cooperating with a Historically Black College/ Universities (HBCU) in Texas, Prairie View A&M University, the American Political Science Association, and the Ronald E. McNair Program at UNT to assist in broadening the pool of applicants to the program, although all students with an interest in this field are encouraged to apply to the program. The growing frequency of civil conflicts in the world and the security concerns these conflicts pose for the United States, the development of human capital that is equipped to deal with these challenges is critical for the national security of the country. <br/><br/>The intellectual focus of the program is on civil conflict management and the enhancement of peace. Indeed since 1945 civil conflicts-civil war, revolution, secessionist war, and ethnic and sectarian violence-has replaced interstate war as the most frequent and deadly form of armed conflict in the world. The program seeks to focus on understanding the causes of civil conflict occurrence (or reoccurrence) by examining sub-state data. In particular, the goal is to train students in theory building and empirical analytical skills, which will promote innovative thinking and problem solving skills. Developing skills in geospatial analysis provides undergraduate program participants with cutting edge tools to understand the causes of conflict, and hence better prepare them to devise innovative solutions regarding civil conflict management."

Outcomes will advance our knowledge of the effects of environmental change on organisms that live in sensitive coastal habitats. Our methods and results will have a significant educational benefit, especially for students from underrepresented groups (e.g., first-generation college students interested in STEM fields), and will be used by high school and undergraduate students by stimulating innovation using STEM educational mechanisms. Through the UNC-BEST (Baccalaureate Education in Science & Teaching) program, we will award future high-school earth science teachers the opportunity to perform scientific research that will generate authentic laboratory curricula for K-12 science courses.

The main objectives are to: 1) establish the seasonal timing of annual growth checks in different biogeographic populations of modern and fossil Astarte using isotope sclerochronology; 2) establish the relationship between biogeographic zone to growth rate and lifespan; and 3) establish the relationship of climate state to growth rate and lifespan. Objectives 2 and 3 employ the von Bertalanffy growth equation and its derivative (standard growth index; SGI) to compare shell growth of a population between modern and fossil, across biogeographic zones, and between cold vs. warm climates. Our null hypotheses will be tested using a mixed model ANOVA and PCA tests. These tests will determine the principal components controlling variability among Astarte populations. This study provides a greater understanding of how biogeographic distribution and differences in seasonal temperature range may influence bivalve growth and longevity and how changing conditions may affect future populations."

These important natural resources that contribute ecosystem services such as carbon storage, nutrient cycling, water and air purification, and wildlife habitat are impacted by natural and man-made disturbances.  Those disturbances include climate variation, air pollution, invasive species and forest harvesting, and this research focuses on how forest ecosystems respond to those disturbances. Despite a long record of research on forest ecosystems, recent observations from HBR of how trees move water through the ecosystem, the role of calcium in forest health, the movement of nitrogen through the ecosystem, and the interactions of plants, insects, and birds within the forest indicate that much is still unknown. Most of the research will occur within the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, a site in the White Mountain region of New Hampshire that is operated by the U.S. Forest Service. The research team will measure the forms of nitrogen retained in soils, the growth and death of trees, the fates of germinating tree seedlings, the amounts and types of litter fall, rates of soil respiration, and how fine roots respond to nitrogen and phosphorus additions.  They also will test how the exchanges of gases, heat, and water vapor between forests and the atmosphere respond to the timing of leaf out in the spring and leaf fall in the autumn. Information about forested ecosystems and the streams that drain them will be made available to land managers through a Forest Science Dialogues Program and a Science Policy Exchange and will inform policy and management decisions on a regional and national scale. The educational and outreach activities planned, including development of classroom curricula for middle- and high school students, a Research Experience for Undergraduates program that is organized in partnership with Plymouth State University, the training of teachers through the Research Experiences for Teachers program, and development of Waterviz, a water cycle visualization tool, will bring ecological knowledge to the public as well as students and teachers at levels from K-12 to graduate school.<br/><br/>The conceptual model underpinning the HBR-LTER project envisions three principal types of disturbance acting as drivers of change in the ecosystem: atmospheric chemistry, climate, and biota. The effects of these drivers play out on geophysical and historical templates that include variation across the landscape in bedrock, soils, hydrology, climate and history of past disturbance. Within the ecosystem, the disturbances affect the interacting processes of hydrology, biogeochemistry, vegetation dynamics and food web dynamics.  Research on the changing atmosphere is focused primarily on the legacies of past air pollution, particularly the depletion of nutrient cations such as calcium from the soil and the accumulation of nitrogen in soil and vegetation. Research on the impacts of climate is focused on causes of the observed long-term decline in evapotranspiration at the site and the effects of changing timing and duration of seasonal transitions on plants, soils, microbes, animals and stream ecosystems. Research on biotic change is focused on the changing composition and structure of the forests caused by multiple interacting stressors including climate, new plant species immigrations, invasive forest pests, and altered disturbance regimes.  Research methods include: long-term field measurements with stable isotopes to provide a better resolution of the strengths of nitrogen sinks in soils and metagenomics shotgun sequencing of community DNA (Illumina HiSeq platform) to provide initial characterization of how microbial community composition and function vary with soil depth; field experiments to identify belowground responses that mediate nutrient recycling and plant uptake in response to nutrient additions and the ensuing impacts on soil enzyme activities, microbial nutrient pools and turnover, rhizosphere allocation, and mycorrhizal functional groups;  simulation modeling with quantitative models such as stand-level ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling models, a carbon and nitrogen model parameterized for individual tree species, an ecosystem demography model, and a multiple element limitation model to synthesize data and experimental knowledge will be used to identify knowledge gaps, develop hypotheses, and make prediction of future forest behavior; and  laboratory studies including 15N NMR to better determine the forms of nitrogen retained in soil organic matter. Education activities include hosting school groups at the site, hands-on training of teachers in scientific research, mentoring undergraduate student research projects, and facilitating research by graduate students.  Outreach activities include synthesizing results of research done at HBR and elsewhere, and communicating the science to local stakeholders through roundtable discussions, to the public through targeted media, and to policy makers through briefings and publications addressing specific policy questions."

The goal of this CAREER award is to vastly improve the scalability and accuracy of learning and inference algorithms for MLNs and thus solve much larger and harder reasoning problems than is possible today. The award also includes a tightly integrated education and outreach component. Specifically, it (1) involves high school students as well as undergraduate students, especially young women in development and model building exercises, encouraging them to pursue career in research; (2) yields open source software tools to facilitate and broaden the adoption of MLN technology; and (3) promotes standardization of datasets and evaluation methodologies via organization of inference competitions.<br/><br/>The key technical contribution of the proposed research is to address two fundamental limitations of lifted probabilistic inference algorithms, the dominating approach for inference and learning in MLNs.

The CAREER award addresses these issues by developing: (1) principled approaches that exploit approximate symmetries; (2) novel learning algorithms that use structured latent variables to induce diverse, highly expressive MLNs; and (3) a unifying message-passing framework called lifted structured message passing that systematically exploits approximate symmetries and structured representations for solving a range of inference tasks defined over MLNs including marginal estimation, maximum-a-posteriori estimation and marginal maximum-a-posteriori estimation."

At the intake of RO desalination plants, disinfectants (e.g., chlorine) are often added to suppress fouling of the treatment units, especially RO membranes, by microorganisms. These disinfectants can react with marine organic matter to form harmful disinfection by-products (DBPs). Recently, marine algal blooms were shown to interrupt desalination operations by causing severe membrane fouling, as a result of the high concentration of algal organic matter (AOM) during algal blooms. While disinfectants are crucial for controlling fouling during algal blooms, the implications of high AOM concentrations on DBP formation in desalination have not been considered. In this project the PI will investigate the formation of DBPs from algae species relevant to marine algal blooms and will develop DBP mitigation strategies for desalination operations. Education activities will focus on promoting professional competencies of environmental engineering students at all degree levels and on broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). <br/><br/>This project will focus on both the fundamentals of DBP formation from marine algae and the application of findings to desalination operations. The project will encompass four research objectives. First, the DBP formation potential of bloom-relevant marine algae species will be evaluated under conditions simulating disinfection in seawater desalination during algal blooms. Representative species will be selected based on their relevance to marine algal blooms along the US coasts. The algae culture and the extracted intra- and extra-cellular AOM will be subjected to a suite of disinfectants, chlorine, chloramine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, permanganate, and their combinations. Second, DBP formation will be evaluated for fresh AOM derived from different algae growth stages and aged AOM after biotic and abiotic transformation. Third, the mechanisms of DBP formation from marine algae cells and the important DBP precursors will be identified. The fundamental knowledge of DBP formation under desalination scenario will be the basis for designing DBP prevention strategies for desalination facilities. Lastly, the effects of AOM transformation upon disinfection on its membrane fouling potential will be characterized to suggest strategies to achieve a balance between membrane fouling control and DBP prevention. Analytical tools such as gas, liquid, and size exclusion chromatography, mass spectrometry, and spectrophotometry will be employed to monitor DBP formation and characterize AOM transformation. The integral educational activities will include graduate student training in research and mentoring, providing research experience for undergraduates, incorporating cooperative design project-based learning in graduate and undergraduate environmental engineering courses, and K-12 outreach focusing on high school and middle school teacher development."

Oxidative or reductive (""redox"") reactions that are mediated by microorganisms control the mobility and toxicity of Sb and As in the environment.  Whereas As has only one stable isotope (75As), Sb has two, 121Sb and 123Sb.  Kinetic isotope effects often favor faster reaction rates for lighter isotopes compared to heavier isotopes during reduction reactions (with generally weaker effects related to oxidation).  This causes a fractionation effect whereby the isotopic ratio in the reaction product may become enriched in the lighter isotope compared to the reactant pool.  Although isotopic fractionation effects have previously been used to indicate the occurrence and extent of redox reactions involving other toxic elements in nature, the extent to which bacterial cycling fractionates Sb isotopes is unknown. This study will establish the extent of Sb stable isotope fractionation during bacterial redox cycling.  Given the geochemical and geomicrobiological similarities between Sb and As, it may also be possible to infer that redox processes detected from Sb isotopic measurements are also actively affecting As when both elements co-occur.  The broader impacts of this project include an improved understanding of the geomicrobiological processes that control the behavior of Sb and As in contaminated settings.  Investigators will also train two MS graduate students and 4 to 6 undergraduate students per year through programs that target underrepresented students. <br/> <br/>The scope of this project is to investigate antimony (Sb) stable isotopic fractionation during geomicrobiological cycling between the environmentally relevant Sb(V) and Sb(III) valence states.

They will conduct experiments with cultures of known Sb(V)-reducing or Sb(III)-oxidizing bacterial strains, as well as novel strains and microcosms obtained from a range of soil, freshwater, hypersaline, and hydrothermal environments.  The liquid phase and solid precipitates in Sb-amended cultures will be periodically sampled during the course of bacterial redox reactions and the isotopic fractionation factors between reactants and reaction products will be measured.  The results will potentially provide a new isotopic tool by which to predict the environmental behavior of Sb or to inform new strategies for bioremediation of Sb and As.  It may also be possible to use the Sb stable isotopic composition of ancient geologic materials to identify the presence of biogeochemical Sb cycling (and, by proxy, As cycling) in the geologic past.  This may provide a test for the hypothesized antiquity of As-based metabolisms, or alternately a proxy by which to assess paleo-redox conditions on ancient Earth."

Over 90% of Americans believe music education is valuable, but very few people ever learn enough to create their own music. Instrument lessons are a great way for some beginners to learn about music; however, instrument lessons are expensive and difficult, and focus on performance and technique at the expense of creativity. This project uses a simple audiovisual composition interface to empower music learners to create their own original music on mobile devices from the very beginning of their music education. By combining this intuitive composition interface with data tracking and analysis, this project creates the opportunity to provide music makers with personalized, adaptive feedback as they compose. Currently, $3 billion are spent each year in the United States on instrument lessons, even though they are unaffordable for many potential customers. By leveraging the proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, this project will deliver an accessible, low-cost digital music education option, creating a new market that includes customers who are currently priced out. Expanding participation in creative music education will increase the quantity and quality of music composed worldwide, while also building a sustainable, revenue-generating business and creating new jobs.<br/><br/>Through data-driven agile software development, this project will address the need for accessible music education through the creation of a technology platform that delivers adaptive learning to musical beginners. Because the platform upon which this project is built is already empowering the creation of thousands of songs each week and collecting usage data from live users, this project is uniquely positioned to tackle the complex problem of providing algorithmic feedback on creative work at scale. Research and development will proceed in four stages: (1) expanding internal tools to allow for direct analysis of the thousands of songs being created on the platform each week; (2) developing an algorithmic approach to analyzing songs and reporting the results to users; (3) applying analysis to match users with relevant communities and collaborators; and (4) implementing adaptive learning approaches to help users more effectively learn to create music. This staged development process will result in an innovative and highly differentiated technology that enables beginners with no musical experience to compose their own music, and uses data to actively support their individual needs as they learn."

It also regulates the distribution of nutrients and their delivery to the sunlit upper ocean, and therefore the production of plant biomass, which ultimately supports nearly all marine life and mediates key carbon fluxes. Determining the mechanisms structuring upper ocean dynamics is critical to understanding how the physical climate system and biogeochemical cycles function. Moreover, climate change is expected to strongly impact these processes; thus, it is crucial to develop a capacity to predict their evolution under altered forcing regimes. This work cannot be done with coarse resolution numerical models because at large scales ocean circulation is constrained mostly to the horizontal plane by the rotation of the Earth. This constraint is lessened at smaller scales and vertical flows become increasingly more energetic.  This project will develop a sound, high-resolution numerical framework for evaluating climate change impacts on upper ocean processes globally and regionally. The tools and workflow for conducting such experiments will be codified in the Community Earth System Model framework and thus be available to other researchers. The study will provide an assessment of the importance of scales not normally included in climate scale models and projections. The results of this and any follow-on studies, will therefore be helpful in putting bounds on the reliability of current projections and in the design of future studies. The project also includes the training and mentoring of a graduate student and a postdoc, who will gain skills in model design, numerical experimentation, and analysis that are vitally important in future studies of societally relevant science.<br/><br/>Climate change projections to date have been done with coarse-resolution ocean models. Recent research, however, has revealed that submesoscale processes, at scales where the constraint by the rotation of the Earth is lessened, play an important role in determining upper ocean stratification, mixed layer depths, and surface-to-depth exchange. Critically, changes to the ocean mean-state under a warming climate are very likely to impact submesoscale activity, with implications for the lateral and vertical fluxes mediated by these processes. This project will use a combination of numerical simulations and observations to quantify the role of submesoscale dynamics in controlling net primary production and export production under present-day climate conditions; it will also examine the mechanisms driving changes in these processes under climate forcing representative of future warming. This is made possible by a novel experimental design that enables computationally feasible climate-change experiments conducted at high-resolution. This involves integrating an eddy-resolving (1/10 degree) global ocean model with biogeochemistry under present-day and future conditions, using anomalies extracted from fully-coupled ensemble integrations to define the climate perturbation. A regional model, nested within the global eddy-resolving domain, will be used to investigate submesoscale dynamics in distinct oceanic regions under different climate conditions. There will be a number of important outcomes of this research relating to changes to the ocean system under a warmer climate. The changing role of mesoscale dynamics in mediating biogeochemical processes globally will be determined. The submesoscale activity in a number of contrasting regions in present-day and warmer climate conditions will be determined. Submesoscale events, their underlying physics and associated heat fluxes as a function of season in both present day and warmer climate conditions will be quantified. The impact of submesoscale activity on ocean biogeochemistry under varied conditions will be determined. The degree to which the changes in submesoscale activity in warmer climate conditions impacts the overall change to the upper ocean physics and biogeochemistry will be determined."

The mucosal wave is the flow-induced elastic wave that propagates in the superficial layer of the vocal fold. Through the wave motion, it controls the glottal air pulses, which form the primary sound source of the voice. Yet, the fundamental questions of how vocal fold biomechanics and flow loading determine the mucosal wave properties, how the mucosal wave properties affect the glottal flow dynamics, and how the flow dynamics determine the voice outcome, remain elusive. This research aims to answer these questions through an integrated computational study. A high fidelity computational model will be developed that describes voice production in all its complexity, including neuro-muscular stimulation, glottal aerodynamics, flow induced vocal fold vibrations, acoustics and their highly complex nonlinear interactions. The computer model will be validated against experimental data that has previously been collected from in vivo canine specimens. The cause-effect relationship between the mucosal wave properties, glottal flow dynamics and voice outcome will be systematically and quantitatively studied through parametric studies.  This research will greatly advance the current state of knowledge regarding voice production, including how voice is controlled.  This knowledge will allow better understand how we use and control our voice. It will also enable development of diagnosis metrics for mucosal wave related voice diseases, determine the adjustments to the vocal folds to restore or improve a damaged voice, and predict the outcome of the adjustment. It can also help people who use their voices excessively (e.g. teachers, telemarketers) by providing them with the knowledge for how to efficiently use and control their voices, with the goal of avoiding damage. Strong collaborations with the University of Maine Communications & Speech Disorders Department will include the development of multidisciplinary courses focusing on speech and the introduction of the developed voice simulator into the educational and training program for future practitioners in speech pathology as well as education for speech disorder patients.<br/><br/>The mucosal wave propagates through the superficial layers of the vocal fold.  It is induced by flow and controls the movement of air through the glottis, which then produces the sound during speech and other forms of phonation.   More importantly, its strong interaction of this elastic wave with the glottal flow generates complex flow patterns and morphologies, such as dynamic flow separation, intraglottal vortices, vortex shedding, shear layer instabilities and transitions to turbulence. All of these factors significantly enhance the complexity inherent to the voice. The foundational questions that will be addressed focus on vocal fold biomechanics, glottal flow dynamics, and how the dynamics of the wave affect the production of the voice.  This will be addressed through an integrated multiphysics computational study.  The integrated educational component involves strong collaboration with the Department of Communication and Speech Disorders.  A multidisciplinary course will be developed to educate both speech pathologists and engineers on the underlying biomechanics of speech.  In addition, the simulation system developed will be directly employed in the training of speech pathologists and in the education of individuals suffering from speech disorders."

AGNES is a semi-annual algebraic geometry meeting organized at a rotating location by an association of northeastern universities. A guiding goal of AGNES is to introduce graduate students to a broad spectrum of current research in algebraic geometry. While meeting this goal, AGNES has become an important center for algebraic geometry in the US. The conference has an extensive record of promoting collaboration and has developed new tools for training and mentoring future leaders in algebraic geometry. These consist of graduate mini-schools, career panels, poster presentations for junior participants (including undergraduate students), and events specifically targeting members of groups that are under-represented in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a sub-field of mathematical sciences that studies solution sets of polynomial equations. It has deep connections to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as topology, arithmetic, number theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and homological algebra. At the same time algebraic geometry has found important applications in applied mathematics and computer science (computer vision, geometric complexity theory, numerical methods in algebraic statistics, etc). The centerpiece research activity of each AGNES meeting will be 7-8 invited lectures given by speakers showcasing different facets of algebraic geometry. The scientific scope of AGNES will be further expanded by lectures from neighboring mathematical subjects (such as arithmetic geometry, dynamics, complex geometry, and computational geometry) and by the various supporting activities described above.

It is likely that many individual zooplankton change vertical mirgratio behaviors to reduce or avoid these stresses. However, avoidance responses and their consequences for zooplankton distributions, and for interactions of zooplankton with their predators and prey, are poorly understood. This study will provide information on small-scale behavioral responses of zooplankton to oxygen and pH using video systems deployed in the field in a seasonally hypoxic estuary. The results will deepen our understanding of how zooplankton respond to low oxygen and pH conditions in ways that could profoundly affect marine ecosystems and fisheries through changes in their populations and distributions. This project will train graduate students and will engage K-12 students and teachers in under-served coastal communities by developing ocean technology-based citizen-scientist activities and curricular materials in plankton ecology, ocean change, construction and use of biological sensors, and quantitative analysis of environmental data.<br/><br/>Individual directional motility is a primary mechanism underlying spatio-temporal patterns in zooplankton population distributions. Motility is used by most zooplankton species to select among water column positions that differ in biotic and abiotic variables such as prey, predators, light, oxygen concentration, and pH. Species-specific movement responses to de-oxygenation and acidification are likely mechanisms through which short-term, localized impacts of these stressful conditions on individual zooplankton will be magnified or suppressed as they propagate up to population, community, and ecosystem-level dynamics. This study will quantify responses by key zooplankton species to oxygen and pH using in situ video systems to measure changes in individual behavior in hypoxic, low- pH versus well-oxygenated, high-pH regions of a seasonally hypoxic estuary. Distributions and movements of zooplankton will be quantified using three approaches: 1) an imaging system deployed in situ on a profiling mooring over two summers in a hypoxic region, 2) imagers deployed on Lagrangian drifters to sample simultaneously throughout the water column, and 3) vertically-stratified pumps and net tows to verify species identification and video-based abundance estimates. These field observations will be combined with laboratory analysis of zooplankton movements in oxygen and pH gradients, and with spatially-explicit models to predict how behavioral mechanisms lead to large-scale impacts of environmental stresses."

Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention.

The ULVZs are so named because seismic waves passing through the Earth slow down dramatically when they encounter these zones. While ULVZs are thought to be related to melting processes, there is growing controversy regarding their origin and the role they play in the thermal and chemical evolution of our planet. The ULVZs may include the largest magma chambers in Earth's interior. Currently, researchers have only searched 40% of Earth's core-mantle boundary for the ULVZs and this project would use existing seismic data to map an unexplored area under Antarctica and interpret the nature of the ULVZs. This project will support two graduate students and create opportunities for undergraduate involvement.   Project results will be published in scientific journals, presented at science fairs, and communicated through the researchers' websites. The research team will also take part in the NSF-sponsored PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating) program to communicate the science to students and the broader community.  <br/><br/><br/>Technical Project Description<br/><br/>The National Research Council has highlighted high-resolution imaging of core-mantle boundary (CMB) structure as a high-priority, emerging research opportunity in the Earth Sciences since anomalies along the CMB likely play a critical role in the thermal and chemical evolution of our planet. Of particular interest are ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs), thin laterally-varying boundary layers associated with dramatic seismic velocity decreases and increases in density that are seen just above the CMB.  Many questions exist regarding the origin of ULVZs, but incomplete seismic sampling of the lowermost mantle has limited our ability to map global ULVZ structure in detail.  Using recently collected data from the Transantarctic Mountains Northern Network (TAMNNET) in Antarctica, this project will use core-reflected seismic phases (ScP, PcP, and ScS) to investigate ULVZ presence/absence along previously unexplored sections of the CMB.  The data sampling includes the southern boundary of the Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVP), a dominant feature in global shear wave tomography models, and will allow the researchers to examine a possible connection between ULVZs and LLSVPs. The main objectives of the project are to: 1) use TAMNNET data to document ULVZ presence/absence in previously unexplored regions of the lowermost mantle with array-based approaches; 2) model the data with 1- and 2.5-D wave propagation tools to obtain ULVZ properties and to assess trade-offs among the models; 3) use high quality events to augment the densely-spaced TAMNNET data with that from the more geographically-distributed, open-access Antarctic stations to increase CMB coverage with single-station analyses; and 4) explore the implications of ULVZ solution models for origin, present-day dynamics, and evolution, including their connection to other deep mantle structures, like LLSVPs.<br/><br/>The project aims to provide new constraints on ULVZs, including their potential connection to LLSVPs, and thus relates to other seismic and geodynamic investigations focused on processes within the Earth?s interior. This project will promote a new research collaboration between The University of Alabama (UA) and Arizona State University (ASU), each of which brings specific strengths to the initiative."

In certain areas of the ocean where iron is scarce, it can limit biological growth even though other essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus are abundant.  Consequently, to fully understand and quantify biological productivity in the ocean, a complete knowledge of all sources and sinks for iron is essential. The researchers funded for this project have already generated exciting preliminary data that suggest a potentially large, yet, unquantified pathway for iron removal. Diatoms, phytoplankton with shells made of silica, are shown to incorporate traces of iron into their shells, making it unavailable for rapid recycling or use by marine organisms in surface waters. Given the great abundance of diatoms in many parts of the ocean, this could represent a major, unstudied removal mechanism that regulates the concentration of iron in seawater. This research could transform current understanding of how iron is removed from the ocean, and it will impact understanding of both the chemical and biological processes involving iron in seawater. The investigator also plans outreach in K-12 schools by providing educational courses for Earth Science teachers and will support graduate student training in advanced chemical analysis and oceanography. <br/><br/>High-resolution synchrotron-based chemical techniques will allow determination of the concentration and oxidation state of iron bound within diatom frustules. This analytical advance has created the ability for unique evaluation of iron sequestration into biogenic silica as a major pathway for iron removal from the ocean. Samples from the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have been collected in a previous CLIVAR field campaign and a subset of these are available for new synchrotron analysis of iron (Fe) with Near Edge X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Fe-NEXFS) and submicron scale X-ray fluorescence mapping, as well as a variety of other chemical characterizations. With these methods, the project will determine the importance of iron sequestered into biogenic silica as a new and unquantified loss term in the oceanic Fe cycle and examine the changing chemical complexes of iron during vertical transport of silica particles through the water column."

Despite progress in increasing enrollment rates, high dropout rates for adolescents, inconsistent attendance, and low levels of learning still plague many developing countries. Using high-quality surveys and administrative data from a large developing country combined with variation from natural experiments, these three papers will investigate how families choose to invest in human capital for their children, and how market forces and government programs affect these choices.  Understanding whether early life investments encourage more educational investments later on, whether higher low-skill rural wages increase dropouts, and whether rural schools produce gains in consumption later in life will help generate evidence so that governments can make informed choices about how best to encourage human capital investment, and ultimately, economic prosperity.  The results of this research have implications for family and individual well-being, economic growth, and national competitiveness.<br/><br/>The research proposal is comprised of three papers. In the first, we will investigate the effect of the largest workfare program in the world, on school enrollment and test scores. Using the timing of the rollout across districts for identification, we will identify whether the income effects of the program outweigh the effect of increased demand for low-skilled labor, which may induce children to leave school in order to work. The second paper estimates the extent of dynamic complementarities in the human capital production function in rural areas using exogenous shocks to consumption early in life and to the costs of schooling in childhood. The model will include a potential return to human capital in the labor market for children, which could induce higher-ability children to drop out of school, even in the presence of dynamic complementarities. The third paper will estimate the returns to rural schools using three exogenous shocks to schooling: the Right to Education Act, the introduction of free school lunches, and district rainfall shocks around the time of primary school completion. We will measure returns not only to wages, as is standard, but also health outcomes, consumption, assets, and marriage and fertility outcomes. Together, these papers will contribute to the understanding of how households choose to invest in schooling for their children, and how valuable these investments are."

Access to, and opportunities within informal STEM learning (ISL) remain limited for youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds in both the United States and the United Kingdom. However, there is evidence that ISL experiences can expand opportunities for youth learning and development in STEM, for instance, increase positive attitudes towards educational aspirations and future careers/pursuits, improve grades and test scores in school settings, and decrease disciplinary action and dropout rates. Through research and development, this project brings together researchers and practitioners to focus on the experiences, practices and tools that will support equitable youth pathways into STEM. Working across conceptual frameworks and ISL settings (e.g. science centers, community groups, zoos) and universities in four urban contexts in two different nations, the partnership will produce a coherent knowledge base that strengthens and expands research plus practice partnerships, builds capacity towards transformative research and development, and develops new models and tools in support of equitable pathways into STEM at a global level. This project is funded through Science Learning+, which is an international partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Wellcome Trust with the UK Economic and Social Research Council. The goal of this joint funding effort is to make transformational steps toward improving the knowledge base and practices of informal STEM experiences. Within NSF, Science Learning+ is part of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that seeks to enhance learning in informal environments and to broaden access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences. <br/><br/>This Equity Pathways project responds to three challenges at the intersections of ISL research and practice in the United States and the United Kingdom: 1) lack of shared understanding of how youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds perceive and experience ISL opportunities across national contexts, and the practices and tools needed to support empowered movement through ISL; 2) limited shared understanding and evidence of core high-leverage practices that support such youth in progressing within and across ISL, and 3) limited understanding of how ISL might be equitable and transformative for such youth seeking to develop their own pathways into STEM. The major goal of this Partnership is for practitioners and researchers, working with youth through design-based implementation research, survey and critical ethnography, to develop new understandings of how and under what conditions they participate in ISL over time and across settings, and how they may connect these experiences towards pathways into STEM. The project will result in: 1) New understandings of ISL pathways that are equitable and transformative for youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds; 2) A set of high leverage practices and tools that support equitable and transformative informal science learning pathways (and the agency youth need to make their way through them); and 3) Strengthened and increased professional capacity to broaden participation among youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds in STEM through informal science learning. The project will be carried out by research + practice partnerships in 4 cities: London & Bristol, UK and Lansing, MI & Portland, OR, US, involving university researchers (University College London, Michigan State University, Oregon State University/Institute for Learning Innovation) practitioners in science museums (@Bristol Science Centre, Brent Lodge Park Animal Centre, Impressions 5, Oregon Museum of Science & Industry) and community-based centers (STEMettes, Knowle West Media Centre, Boys & Girls Clubs of Lansing, and Girls, Inc. of the Pacific Northwest)."

This project models the genetic inheritance of canine and premolar tooth size in several primate species, including a modern human sample, to examine the impact of genetic structures on the evolution of sex differences in canine size. The findings will be used to understand mechanisms of canine reduction in the human lineage and canine expansion in other primates, and contribute to our understanding of evolutionary relationships among diet, behavior, and dentition in our hominin ancestors. elective pressures related to aggression and diet are hypothesized to contribute to sex differences in primate canine teeth, and changes in these selective pressures may have led to human canine and premolar reduction. The project will support training of a female student in a STEM field, production of a large dataset that will be made public for other researchers, and outreach activities such as public lectures focused on improving public understanding of primate diversity and evolution.<br/><br/>Dental characteristics provide valuable evidence of genetic relatedness in primates, and tooth measurements are well-suited to classical quantitative genetic analysis, which uses pedigree data to estimate the genetic heritability of traits. This project assesses the genetic inheritance of canine and premolar dimensions in several primate species with the specific aim of elucidating the genetic mechanisms underlying sex differences in the morphology of these teeth. Previous researchers have stated that sex differences in genetic inheritance and low overlap in male and female genetic material contribute to the evolution of sex differences, but these hypotheses have not been tested in primates. This project addresses three fundamental research questions: 1) Are sex differences in canine and premolar size associated with sex differences in trait inheritance? 2) Do the same genes impact the size of the upper canine and lower premolar? 3) Do primate species with sex differences in the canine have more evolvable canines than those with no sex differences? These questions can be answered using tooth size measurements collected from primate populations with known pedigrees. Statistical models will be used to estimate the inheritance of canine and premolar size in each population.  Preliminary data collection and analyses of saddle-back tamarins indicate that there are significant differences between male and female patterns of trait inheritance, but data from additional populations and species will demonstrate whether this is typical of primates broadly or a peculiarity limited to a single tamarin population."

The goal of this research is to enable security and software technology gains within member organizations.  Virginia Tech's site specifically focuses on challenges with software and security for cyber-physical systems, with a particular emphasis on the emerging areas of critical infrastructure and the Internet of Things.  Addressing security and privacy challenges with these technologies are critical to protecting homeland security and preserving civil liberties in an increasingly interconnected world.  Research executed through this program will be principally funded by industry partners who join the consortium as members, with the goal of developing commercialization paths for resulting innovation.  Additionally students who will be supported on projects will gain insight into real-world problems of direct interest to industry, and will forge relationships that can lead to recruiting and future career placement in an increasingly competitive technology discipline.<br/><br/><br/>Ultimately the specific technical problems tackled and approaches considered will be determined by the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) who provides governance for S2ERC.  However Virginia Tech seeks to focus on recruiting and sustaining members with a specific interest in the security and privacy challenges with cyber-physical systems.  Given the experience of the faculty and researchers involved, research undertaken is expected to leverage deep expertise in security for embedded systems, control systems, and wireless systems.  Within the embedded systems domain, we will develop and leverage tools in program analysis and software synthesis to develop provably safe and secure firmware for embedded devices.  For control systems we will seek to translate functions typically found in the defense of computer networks into components used in embedded control networks to detect and block anomalous control signaling.  Within the wireless area, we seek to ensure resilience within networks such that attempts to disrupt wireless infrastructure have minimal effect on critical functions using the network.  With the umbrella of the larger center, we seek to synthesize these concepts into tools and techniques that can transcend each in order to address security overall for systems and systems of systems.  Lastly we seek to understand the human element in these cyber-physical systems and work to ensure security technologies integrate with the user experience and are effective in real-world deployments."

Biologists have long tried to explain why this form of reproduction is so widespread across nature despite substantial costs. One possibility is that mixing up genomes through recombination allows natural selection to act more efficiently. Yet, asexual reproduction should be more efficient: it avoids the costs of finding partners and mating, and allows individuals to pass all (rather than half) of their genetic material to their offspring. This research will test this hypothesis by comparing adaptation in sexual versus asexual yeast populations. In addition to these scientific goals, this work will involve the development and dissemination of curriculum integrating mathematics and biology education. <br/><br/>Much recent theoretical attention has focused on the potential for recombination to speed adaptation by bringing together beneficial mutations that occur in different genetic backgrounds, alleviating competition and interference between them. Similarly, recombination can purge deleterious mutations from advantageous genetic backgrounds. However, experimental evidence for these effects is scarce. A few laboratory microbial evolution experiments have shown that recombination can indeed increase the rate of mean fitness increase in adapting populations, but until recently it has been impossible to directly observe the effects of recombination at the genotypic level. This research will quantify how recombination alters the sequence-level dynamics of adaptation in experimental populations of budding yeast, by combining a novel genetic system with high-throughput sequencing methods to characterize how recombination alters the dynamics and outcomes of genomic sequence evolution in laboratory budding yeast populations. This work will then track the long-term fate of sexual reproduction in direct competition with asexuals, to determine how and why sexual reproduction is favored or lost in adapting populations. This project will produce extensive data describing the rate, predictability, and genetic basis of adaptation in laboratory populations that will contribute to the advancement of the field."

Protecting sensitive data often involves reasoning about how sensitive values and policies are interacting with functionality across the program. The need to reason across the code base makes it difficult not only for programmers to implement computations using sensitive data, but also to make existing code adhere to new policies. This project investigates an approach for (1) inferring information flow policies from potentially buggy code and (2) performing program repair to ensure programs adhere to the specified policies. Not only does this approach help identify potential misuses of sensitive information, but it also helps prevent leaks in code from well-intentioned programmers, and provides a mechanism for modifying arbitrary code to satisfy a given policy.<br/><br/>Enabling this approach is a policy-agnostic semantic model, developed to disentangle information flow concerns from other functionality. Using policy-agnostic programming, the programmer may implement information flow policies by specifying them alongside sensitive data values, rather than implementing them as conditional access checks across the program. Prior work on Lifty supports policy-agnostic programming using type-driven repair, based on program synthesis for liquid types, which are value-dependent refinement types. Previously, programs could only benefit from policy-agnostic programming if the policies are known, but this is not always the case with existing code. We propose an approach for inferring liquid types from potentially buggy code. The inferred types now make it possible to perform sound repair. Representing the inferred policies as liquid types also facilitates modification of the policies. The proposal describes both a strategy for inferring a set of possible policies, and a solution for choosing which policies to use for repair."

These systems typically operate well when the scene dynamics do not change rapidly. Unfortunately this is not the case in emerging societally-important applications like swarms of drones in rescue missions, smart self-driving cars on roadways, or cyber-physical systems searching for suicide bombers when they are on the move. This project will benefit our society with the development of the first four-dimensional (4D) millimeter-wave imaging system operating in fast changing scenarios, in which safety-critical decisions must be made quickly. One of the new applications of this system will be finding security threats, concealed under clothing or inside backpacks, in open areas like shopping malls, sport venues, and office buildings. Specifically, the system will have the capability to scan multiple people moving within a volumetric region of 26 cubic meters, producing 1000 image frames per second in three dimensions, thus outperforming existing millimeter-wave sensing and imaging systems that are currently used at airport checkpoints. In addition to the societal impact, the Principal Investigator (PI) will build a strong educational program through which diverse audiences can understand the principles and limitations of wave-based imaging systems. The integration of research and education will be accomplished through the development of new curricula and research training methods for students, as well as through the elaboration of a roadmap for transitioning students into industry, in collaboration with Northeastern University (NEU) Cooperative Education Program. The outreach plan includes enabling research experiences for K-12, undergraduate, and underrepresented students in collaboration with the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) centers at NEU, as well as education through online materials and public venues.<br/><br/>The research goal of this CAREER program is to understand the theoretical principles and fundamental limitations of adaptable compressive sensing and imaging systems using 4D (temporal and spatial) coding and to develop and experimentally validate these principles through a novel 4D millimeter-wave adaptive compressive imaging radar system. This system will produce 4D volumetric frame rates beyond 1000 frames per second, each frame having over one million pixels. The primary challenges of implementing 4D adaptable imaging systems are the following: 1) the system must be capable of handling variable dynamics, i.e., objects moving with different velocities and located at different focal ranges; 2) the system must sample data with sufficient signal to noise ratio during the limited period of time; and 3) the system must sample data extremely fast to perform fast 4D video reconstruction with high volumetric frame rates. This project will address these challenges as follows: (i) it will develop a new theory that brings together functional analysis, information theory, compressive sensing, and adaptable metamaterials to enhance the information transfer efficiency of sensing systems; (ii) it will develop a new mathematical framework to optimize 4D codes based on the desired information rate and energy efficiency of the compressive imaging system; and (iii) the system will utilize spatial light modulators, vortex-meta-lenses, and compressive reflectors to perform the coding and to dynamically adapt to the state of the imaging region. The result of this research will establish the scientific basis for the proposed new sensing and imaging systems, by enhancing the imaging performance, reliability, and efficiency while reducing the hardware complexity, overall cost, and energy consumption of the system."

More information is available online at http://www.fg2017.org/.  The Doctoral Consortium will provide an opportunity for Ph.D. students whose dissertations are on topics related to automatic face and gesture recognition to present their proposed research, and receive constructive feedback from an invited committee of faculty and industry researchers, as well as from other students working in these areas.  The event will give students valuable exposure to outside perspectives of their work, and provide a comfortable forum in which to discuss and fine-tune their career objectives with members of the international research community, and identify areas that need further development. The workshop will also enable these young researchers to develop a network of contacts at a critical stage of their careers, and will foster a supportive community of scholars and spirit of collaborative research, which will have broad impact because graduate students who are conducting creative and groundbreaking work are the foundation and future of the community.  The organizers will make a particular effort to recruit and include students from underrepresented groups (women and underrepresented minorities) and from smaller schools. <br/><br/>The Doctoral Consortium will be a half-day event during the conference.  There will be five distinct aspects to the event.  Each student participant will be assigned a mentor based upon similarity of research interest and experience, who will discuss the work one-on-one with the student and provide constructive comments and guidance.  There will be an oral session in which all participants present their research to the group.  And there will also be a Doctoral Consortium poster session during the main conference, which will afford the students an opportunity to present their research to the rest of the community.  Extended abstracts (up to 4 pages long) of the students' research will be published online on the FG 2017 website.  Finally, students and mentors will all share a working lunch, in which mentors will briefly describe their career paths and student participants will ask the mentors questions about the different career paths.  The combination of these five activities will provide an excellent and structured way for students to communicate with other students as well as with established members of their research community."

On-the-move energy systems include a broad range of applications from small portable electronic devices to air, sea, and ground transportation systems, which impact all aspects of modern life.  Despite their wide range of power ratings and diverse applications, on-the-move energy systems share a number of challenging design and technical requirements. The long-term impact of this center is to make on-the-move energy systems more efficient, more reliable, and more affordable.  Consequently, it promotes a safer and cleaner environment.  Also, it gives the U.S. a technological and economical competitive advantage in the global market.  The proposed research activities are strongly intertwined with comprehensive educational activities which will expose students at all levels to discovery-based and industry-focused skills.  <br/>On-the-move systems and devices typically operate off the grid with minimal (e.g. charging, etc.) interaction with the grid.  COMET's projects are designed to solve fundamental challenges and real-world engineering problems that will advance and create new technologies for the relevant industries.  COMET's main focus areas are (1) mobility and agility advancement, (2) fault-tolerance and reliability improvement, (3) prolonging operational time, and (4) power density enhancement.  To achieve these goals, six critical approaches are considered as (i) alternative materials, (ii) alternative energy harvesting, (iii) contactless charging, (iv) smart designs for harsh environment, (v) real-time condition monitoring, and (vi) real-time corrective actions. The proposed center advances the research and design methodologies for these energy systems while taking into consideration specific challenges of each application.  The team of researchers at Missouri S&T has research experience in energy and power management for on-the-move systems.  Also, they have considerable expertise in increasing the power density of such systems while maintain their cost competitive."

In addition to hands-on research in laboratories of their choice, participants partake in various academic activities, including weekly research talks by faculty, workshops on presentation, ethics, the nature of science and science identify, poster sessions, and a five-week GRE course taught by graduate student volunteers. The program seeks to recruit students from across the United States who belong to underrepresented minority (URM) groups, and students at Heritage University and Shoreline Community College, partner sites in WA. This program accommodates a wide range of students, from those with limited prior exposure to those who are experienced and intent on pursuing STEM degrees. Applications are simple (see webpage); personal statement, recommendations, and transcripts are required. Students receive a generous stipend, roundtrip travel, meals, and housing.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that a total of 30 students primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, including URM students, will be trained in the program. This program builds confidence and skills in preparation for advanced STEM programs, encourages participation in research conferences, and introduces participants to researchers, including URM researchers, at different stages in their careers to create support networks and foster long-term mentor relationships.<br/><br/>A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

A challenge that is often ignored, however, is the adversarial nature of many domains, in which social, economic, and political interests may try to manipulate intelligent systems into making costly mistakes.  While AI has a long history in playing adversarial games, such as chess and poker, the approaches have not been appropriate for many real-world situations.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a general framework for adversarial AI that is far broader in scope and applicability, building on insights from game theory, AI planning, and cybersecurity.<br/><br/>A key modeling insight of the proposed research is that attacks across a broad array of settings can be modeled as planning problems, so that robust algorithms can be fundamentally viewed as interdicting attack plans.  Our research will develop new foundational techniques for scalable plan interdiction under uncertainty, building off of the framework of Stackelberg games. Proposed techniques will leverage a combination of abstraction, factored representation of state, and value function approximation.  In addition, novel scalable algorithms will be developed for multi-stage interdiction problems, modeled as sequential stochastic games, considering both perfect and imperfect information. Moreover, the research will make novel modeling and algorithmic contributions in multi-defender and multi-attacker interdiction games.  Finally, in the more applied arena, the research will make significant intellectual contributions in applying advances in adversarial AI to model problems exhibiting important adversarial aspects, such as privacy-preserving data sharing, access control and audit policies, and vaccine design.<br/>"

Energy democracy refers to an emerging movement among members of the public, local government entities, and non-governmental organizations that re-imagines energy consumers as prosumers, or innovators, designers and analysts who are involved in decisions at every stage of energy production and consumption. The research agenda that will be developed in this workshop brings together scholarship in energy communication, democratic theory, interdisciplinary energy studies, and publicly-engaged STS research to discover ways to encourage more participatory democracy in relation to energy policy in the United States. The primary intellectual merit of this project is to forge a new line of research that empirically examines energy democracy practitioners and develops practical theory that advances democratic decision-making in relation to energy policy. This research program highlights the crucial contribution that social scientific and humanities research has on understanding energy democracy, and more broadly the sociopolitical dimensions of energy policy. It will create new networks between communication, STS, and interdisciplinary energy scholarship, particularly as related to energy decision-making, the relationship between technology and democracy, and the sociopolitical aspects of energy in the context of broader environmental trends. The broader impact of this project is to create a research program that addresses energy, which is one of the most profound sustainability challenges facing society. The workshop will initiate a research program that can help people to better understand the linkages between energy development and democratic process. <br/><br/>Expanding social demands on energy systems beyond access, reliability, and affordability to include a suite of environmental and economic benefits, along with technological innovation, has fundamentally altered the configuration of citizens who can directly influence shifts in energy systems. Amidst these sometimes chaotic changes, democratic ideals, including the importance of public engagement in energy decisions, have contributed to an emerging movement for energy democracy. Yet, research on the empirical and theoretical development of energy democracy lags behind this growing movement among publics and energy practitioners. This workshop will develop a sustained research program that investigates the broad range of actors, democratic values, democratic functions, and governance sites that are involved in the practice of energy democracy. By bringing together a range of scholars, local energy practitioners, and publics, the workshop will initiate a lively conversation about energy democracy and its potential as an academic area of study. Specifically, this workshop will: 1) foster better collaboration between STS, communication, and interdisciplinary energy scholars; 2) result in a white paper and special issue in an open-source journal; and 3) prioritize transdisciplinary scholarship that seeks to bridge divides between academia, local energy practitioners, and publics. The products of this workshop will be broadly disseminated to both academic and public audiences through a symposium website, and will be incorporated into ongoing programs of teaching and mentorship of undergraduate and graduate students in research on energy related topics. The workshop will also broaden participation of women and underrepresented groups in this research area."

This is especially notable in countries with a greater ambiguity in racial categories among its citizens.  That said, even in countries that tend to be perceived as racially harmonious, citizens of ambiguous racial background tend to place themselves in racial categories associated with lighter skin colors when possible.  This research seeks to assess the implications that result in racial identification after adoption of affirmative action programs for citizens of African descent.  The research notes that when such programs were adopted by the government, the result was a significant increase in the number of individuals categorizing themselves as nonwhite.  This research proposes to investigate why individuals are increasingly self-identifying in nonwhite racial groups, and why this trend varies across different regions of country in question.  The research draws upon existing studies of ethnic identity politics to expand the approach to apply to Latin America where such theories tend to fall short because social cleavages tend be de-politicized by political elites who seek to reduce the influence of such identities within the electoral arena. This project seeks to contribute to this line for work, by improving our understanding of when and where individuals adopt and identify with a particular societal identity when doing so may coincide with an increased discrimination and disadvantage in society.  Such insight can help improve the quality of representation in democratic political systems.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This dissertation aims to shed new light on the processes by which social identities translate into political identities.  The researcher investigates this question by analyzing the longitudinal and subnational variation in patterns of racial identification.  The author will test two hypotheses related to trends in social identities. The first hypothesis is that individuals have begun to reclassify themselves into darker racial categories in order to qualify for newly available affirmative action benefits.  The second is a political identity hypothesis in which changes in affirmative action policies have undermined the perception of racial harmony and led more individuals to affirm nonwhite identification. To explain subnational variation, the PI assesses a cleavage structure hypothesis stating that individuals are more likely to reclassify their identification in those localities where racial and class status are reinforcing rather than cross-cutting cleavages. To test these hypotheses, the research design proposes three principal empirical approaches. The researcher will construct an original dataset of municipal-level census data on racial change to test the hypothesis related to the changes in identity observed over time, and on subnational the subnational variation in racial identity. The survey data will be bolstered with additional qualitative field research consisting of participant observation, in-depth personal interviews, focus group interviews, and elite interviews which will provide richer and direct evidence of racial change and its micro-level mechanisms. Third, the PI will conduct local-level surveys to test rival hypotheses of how and why individuals assume nonwhite identities."

As a result, the center will serve as a national platform for interdisciplinary research and communication, charged with investigating advanced computing platforms relevant to various topics of national interests such as national security and smart living, with an eye toward commercialization and economic development for the nation. It will pave the way for designing new computing diagram to address the White House Grand Challenge of developing transformational computing capabilities.<br/><br/>Motivated by the fast growth of cognitive applications and the recent significant development progress of underlined technologies, the center will focus on designing alternative computing platforms for these applications, which is generally difficult to be efficiently executed on conventional von Neumann architecture. Industry is in great demand for a revolutionary computing platform designated to these applications and the planned academia-industry consortium is well positioned to meet such demanding needs with real-world applications. The establishment of ASIC, hence, will accelerate the development of the new computing diagram in industry sectors and expedite technology transfer from research discoveries to practical solutions. <br/><br/>The University of Notre Dame Site of the proposed Center will focus on hardware innovations, especially infrastructure and implementation, based on its wide connections with the corresponding industry. The research projects performed, if succeed, will benefit computer and IT industries by introducing alternative computing platforms that well complement the conventional systems built on von Neumann architecture in short term, and position alternative sustainability and intelligent computing equivalently important in long term. The obtained knowledge and expertise will effectively backup the predictable booming of cognitive applications and their urgent demands for hardware and software supports. The talents and expertise of center PIs and the industry partners will be effectively integrated to enhance the competence of the center members and accelerate technology transfer process. The key transformative aspect of the planned ASIC is that, the success of the project will make great advances in seamlessly integrating non von Neumann vs. von Neumann architectures for future computing. Upon completion, this planning project will prepare a solid full center proposal for Phase I with strong supports from industry and government members. Broader impacts of the project will be reached by wide dissemination of the project outcomes via publications, seminars, tutorials and workshops, as well as industrial and military courses, social media and technology transfer activities. Students will receive invaluable experience in industry relevant applied research and networking opportunities with industry representatives in order to capitalize these experiences for their eventual employment."

The Annual Meeting of OHBM is regarded as the premier venue for the integration of innovative brain imaging methods and cognitive neuroscience. It was started more than 20 years ago to provide a forum for the brain-mapping scientific community to disseminate findings and enable interactions among scientists investigating the functional organization of the brain with emerging imaging methods. Since 1994, the OHBM has sponsored twenty-two highly successful meetings, where attendees are exposed to cutting-edge neuroimaging data acquisition methods, emerging approaches to large-scale neuroimaging data analysis, the visualization of results, and their applications in health and disease. This award will fund travel awards for deserving students and trainees to attend the 2017 Annual Meeting to be held in Vancouver, Canada. Travel awards will be given to 30 students with high-ranking abstracts. Of these at least 15 travel awards will be awarded to the students with the top-ranked abstracts among 3 targeted groups (women, minorities, disabled. <br/><br/>The Annual Meeting provides a means for students of neuroimaging to attend educational courses, hear lectures from leading brain researchers, form new collaborations, and to present their original research. Historically, female representation in the mathematical and computational sciences has been low. In contrast, in both neuroscience and psychology it has been relatively very high. Hence, the ability to work in the cross-section of statistics, computer-science, psychology, and neuroscience promises to provide computational training to a diverse audience and help bridge the gender gaps in the STEM fields. In addition, improved understanding of the organization of the human brain is directly relevant to treating neurological and psychiatric disease, and the use of non-invasive imaging methods is increasingly important to translational investigation and training in clinical neuroscience. As neuroimaging is used in a wide-range of scientific disciplines, we would expect benefits for society in areas ranging from economic and social policies to medical, educational and psychological interventions."

The work involves a combination of water sampling and subsurface observations in a set of study watersheds in the Maryland Piedmont region, which will feed into analysis and modeling using novel theoretical tools developed by the PI. The results will contribute to allied research efforts to understand the effects of climate variability on water quality where agricultural fertilizer use has generated a legacy of nitrate in groundwater stores. Similarly the results may have implications for our understanding of the effects of long-term climate variability on the movement of water through the weathering bedrock, which has implications for our understanding of the earth?s carbon cycle on geologic timescales. Research and education are integrated into this work in multiple ways. A portion of the funds from the project will be used to enrich the STEM content of summer day camps at the field site, and provide access to the camps for elementary school children from predominantly-African American inner-city Baltimore schools. Hands-on experimental and field hydrology resources will be developed to enrich the undergraduate hydrology curriculum at Johns Hopkins. Open-access virtual workshops, datasets and associated software tools will be developed to train graduate students at other institutions in new methodologies and their potential applications to their field sites.<br/><br/>An increasing number of studies suggest that headwater streamflow is derived from the turnover of apparently large volumes of water in the subsurface. However this storage, and the nature of its turnover, is not well understood at the catchment scale. At the same time, investigations into the critical zone are elucidating controls on the structure and properties of the subsurface, including the processes of weathering and fracturing that generate water-filled pore volume. This project aims to link the emergent storage and transport properties of hillslopes and sub-watersheds to the evolved structure of the entire subsurface critical zone. A novel theoretical approach, built on recent advances in time-variable transit time distributions, now allows emergent hillslope-scale relationships between storage, discharge, and age structure to be captured in a single unified function, f_Q. This provides a framework for expressing fundamental hypotheses about the relationship between critical zone structure, climate variability, and hydrologic transport. Hypotheses will be tested in nested field sites in a deeply weathered, fractured watershed in Maryland, where geophysical studies suggest that topographically-induced bedrock fracturing drives the structure of the critical zone. A combination of passive isotope tracer sampling, deep and shallow drilling, borehole geophysical observations and irrigation experiments will be conducted to examine the critical zone structure, test quantitative hypotheses about the nature of f_Q, and examine the potential of this framework as a basis for catchment-scale coupled flow and transport modeling.<br/>"

This co-evolutionary relationship can be investigated via study of the archaeological record in conjunction with study of natural sediment and soil profiles that record changes in past environments. The combined study of human adaptation and human impacts on the environment can provide insight into how environments respond to human activities and whether those responses are beneficial or detrimental to humans. Studying these processes may also provide insight into current and future human impacts and the kinds of human adaptation that produce the most favorable outcomes for both the environment and future generations of humans. <br/><br/>The project focuses on the shift to settled village life on tropical coasts of the New World. Mr. Daniels will investigate the recursive relationship between humans and their environment in this setting by focusing on the archaeological and sedimentary records that accumulated between approximately 5000 and 3000 years ago on the Pacific coast of southern Chiapas, Mexico. This wetland environment lies behind wide barrier beaches and consists of mangrove forests and lagoons within which there is a rich archaeological record of the Archaic and Early Formative periods. The project will unravel how Archaic and Early Formative occupants' manipulation of the environment through land clearance, planting, and other activities affected the stability of the estuary-lagoon system and may have created conditions conducive for the emergence of settled village life. The main hypothesis that will be explored is that increased inland land clearance during the Archaic and initial Early Formative periods contributed to the expansion of the mangrove estuary, thus creating an opportunity for Early Formative people to exploit a new abundance of wetland resources and ultimately to develop more sedentary subsistence strategies. The investigation will combine excavations on small mounds within the mangroves with examination of the history of barrier-beach formation downstream from the mounds. A precise chronology of changes in the two settings will facilitate reconstruction of what the environment was like when it was first colonized by people and how the environment responded to initial and subsequent human impacts."

As the Arctic warms and vegetation ranges are expected to expand northward; the increase in woody vegetation at high latitudes has important implications for both global and northern latitude ecosystems.  By identifying how past plant community shifted and by reconstructing temperatures using two new techniques that analyze lake sediments, the doctoral student will enhance understanding about the complexities of the interplay between climate and biogeography at high latitudes both in the past and in a potentially warmer future.  The project will provide research education and training opportunities for undergraduate students.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising doctoral student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>The doctoral student will use a combination of relatively new techniques to analyze past environments.  One is the analysis of previously dated lake sediments for sedimentary ancient DNA, the complex mixture of degraded DNA found within bulk sediment, in order to identify the plants that lived within the lake catchment during the Holocene Epoch.  The second technique the student will employ is a recently developed biochemical tool, the use of a distribution of a class of bacterial cell membrane lipids called ""branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers"" (brGDGTs) which is able to estimate past temperature.  Using these techniques, the student will seek answers to the following sets of research questions:  1) Following the retreat of glaciers, how long did it take for dwarf shrubs to become established in the lake catchment?  2) How did plant diversity respond to the warmth of the early Holocene and cooling during the Late Holocene?  3) When did Betula (dwarf birch), a shrub that likes warmer temperatures currently near its northern limit in this field area, become established, and did it remain present through Holocene temperature fluctuations?  Through the use of these new techniques in combination, the project's results will offer new perspectives about the climatic and temporal factors influencing northward plant migration in high northern latitudes."

Algorithmic implementations of the methods are highly scalable and can take full advantage of massively parallel high-performance computing systems. Validation, testing, and comparison of the methods will be carried out using realistic observations simulated from models of varying complexity."

These models may have persisted, if it were not for the discovery of very ancient crystals from this Eon.  These crystals - or specifically the mineral zircon (ZrSiO4) - have ages that extend back to about 4.4 billion years in age, and thus represent a unique source of information about the earliest Earth.  The major goal of this research is to 'translate' the chemical information preserved within these crystals into physical and potentially planetary-wide constraints that specifically bear on water-rock interactions occurring on Earth before 4 billion years ago.  This was an intriguing time on Earth, because it is likely that the crust or its chemically weathered constituents played a role in the origin of life.  <br/><br/>The research proposed capitalizes on the knowledge that elements of O (oxygen) and Si (silicon) have multiple isotopes, and furthermore that the isotope ratios recorded in minerals, including zircon, may tell complementary stories of a larger puzzle about water-rock interactions that have occurred on our planet.  The investigation will begin by conducting: (i) high precision Si- and O- isotope measurements on well constrained rock and mineral samples; and (ii) high pressure/temperature experiments in the precision-controlled environment of the University of Rochester experimental geochemistry laboratory. This information will be used to interpret the Si- and O- isotope geochemistry of ancient zircon crystals to explore crustal recycling in a new manner. The broader impacts of this project come from the training of undergraduate and graduate students in high temperature/pressure experimental techniques and crystal synthesis, and isotope analysis using state-of-the-art mass spectrometers. The Rochester laboratory plans to host high school science teachers from the surrounding area to introduce them to the technology and the science used in this study.  These workshops expose science teachers to cutting edge science and technology and data that they can take back into their classrooms."

This project builds on decades of research in North Inlet estuary in South Carolina on the productivity of salt marsh cord grass that have led to new insights about the regulation of marsh productivity and the feedbacks that maintain salt marshes in equilibrium with sea level.  This research is important because sea level is rising at an accelerating rate and threatens to drown these ecosystems.  This project will employ a combination of experiments and field observations to understand how increasing cord grass root growth impacts the elevation of the marsh surface as sea level rises.  Fertilizer additions will be used to increase root growth and test the hypothesis that this will allow the marsh surface to rise.  These manipulations to simulate changing marsh elevations will provide a direct test of how relative elevation affects plant growth. This research will further development of an important management tool, the Marsh Equilibrium Model, for coastal resource managers.<br/><br/>LTREB research at North Inlet has included monthly measurements on permanent plots of stem counts and heights of marsh cord grass (Spartina alterniflora) made since 1984 and supplemented by monthly measurements of porewater chemistry, snail density, and marsh surface elevation.  A synthesis of these data has led to the development of a marsh equilibrium theory and the Marsh Equilibrium Model describing how feedbacks among plants, nutrients, tidal flooding, and sediments move a marsh toward an equilibrium with sea level.  During the next five years this project will continue development of theory, continue collection of primary data, and conduct experimental manipulations to test the importance of plant roots and nutrients on marsh elevation.  It is hypothesized that nutrient additions will increase the growth of roots and thereby raise the equilibrium marsh elevation.  A resumption of nitrogen and phosphorus treatments in field plots, with before and after computed tomography scans of sediment cores, coupled with measurements of marsh surface elevation will test the effects of nutrients on the relative importance of belowground production and sediment trapping to vertical accretion.  Bioassay experiments using marsh organs will directly test the productivity-elevation hypothesis and will be conducted in parallel with the field observations. The broader impacts of this project extend to the public through talks given about sea level rise and marshes to civic groups, discussions with policy makers, and participation in policy forums. Graduate student training and use of the long-term fertilization and census plots in the salt marsh at North Inlet by visiting scholars will be supported."

The two SuperDARN radars, with a combined field-of-view exceeding 75 in azimuth centered on the magnetic meridian, will be capable of making measurements of the ionospheric electric field over a region that includes eastern North America, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia and western Russia. Measurements in this sector, currently limited to the region north of 65 latitude, will extend the capabilities of the SuperDarn network to provide near real-time maps of the convection electric field during an expanded range of geomagnetic activity levels and increase the local time (LT) coverage to more than 12 hours. Existing radars at similar latitudes have demonstrated the importance of measurements from radars located at mid-latitudes during quiet to more active geomagnetic conditions and in particular, the ability of these radars to make detailed measurements of the sub-auroral polarization stream (SAPS) on rapid timescales (<1 min) over an extended range (>8 hours LT).  The installation of the two SuperDarn radars in Ireland would make possible investigations of longitudinal differences associated with the South Atlantic Anomaly in SAPS and electric field structuring as well as conjugate studies with southern hemisphere radars. In line with the geospace community review panel recommendations, distributed networks of ground-based instruments are quite valuable in resolving space-time ambiguities associated with sparse measurements of the space environment and making progress toward the science goals of the Solar Wind-Magnetosphere Interactions. The Ireland radars will significantly increase measurements of the electric field at mid-latitudes enabling SuperDARN to provide real-time observations of space weather disturbances in the ionosphere extending from Asia, across North America and into Northern Europe.  This should result in significant progress toward the larger goal of providing the capability to predict the effects of solar variability on the environment and on society.<br/><br/>An important aspect of the proposed project is the calibration of SuperDARN elevation angle measurements which can be used to improve the geolocation of backscattered signals, to discriminate between propagation modes and to estimate the index of refraction at the scattering location - this is now normally done by modeling using ray tracing software, and such models might be in error at times.<br/>The project includes a small augmentation that will enable one of the interferometer arrays to be configurable and allow for testing of the sensitivity and accuracy of SuperDARN interferometers. Ireland is ideally situated for interferometer testing with two Scandinavian ionospheric heating facilities providing a calibration source within the field-of-view of the augmented radar. The project would very efficiently reuse most of a ready-to-go radar system that for various logistical and political reasons never got installed in the Azores. This is a highly targeted re-purposed application that minimizes substantially the installation budget."

Previous work by the PI has shown that this processing can include repackaging of information for optimal prediction. This suggests a new approach to neural encoding. While many previous studies have sought to characterize what stimuli in the past gave rise to a subsequent response, this work asks what future stimuli those responses predict. The proposed project will derive the best possible predictor given the way objects move in the outside world and quantify how close the brain gets to this optimum. Viewing the brain through the lens of prediction develops a principle of neural coding and computation that can bridge brain regions, from the retina to higher visual areas. A component of this plan involves measuring and quantifying the predictive components of natural motion. In doing so, a public database of natural motion will be created that will be a lasting tool for the neuroscience and computer vision communities. An associated educational program will bring over 100 local middle school children to campus each year for hands-on neuroscience experiments, and will instill in a large group of graduate students the rewards and responsibilities of science teaching.<br/><br/>The research proposed here explores prediction in the visual system in a variety of ways: by computing efficiency bounds on the predictive encoding of complex motion, by developing quantitative methods to test these bounds in neural datasets, by measuring the statistics of motion in natural scenes, and by describing how, mechanistically, the brain achieves this performance. Hypotheses about how the brain performs optimal predictive computations may be constrained by the structure of predictable events in the natural visual world. To measure these statistics, a new natural movie database will be constructed by making high-speed, high-pixel-depth recordings of natural scenes. By quantifying motion in these data, this project will yield statistical and generative models of natural motion that will inform our understanding of the natural world and provide a compact way to recapitulate natural motion in silico. These stimuli will be used to test whether neural systems optimally encode information relevant for prediction. The work will also test what adaptive and otherwise non-linear processing steps underlie optimal prediction in the brain.<br/>"

Results will guide development of a computational model of speech planning and production that has the potential to accelerate the design of new therapeutic approaches to developmental and acquired disorders of speech. Additional benefits to society will accrue from a series of teaching modules that will be developed that explore the role of auditory feedback in normal and disordered speech.

The first research goal is to determine the role of delayed auditory feedback (DAF) on speech sequencing using multimodal experimental techniques. Acoustic data will be collected and analyzed to determine the impact of DAF on the production of non-word syllable sequences and sentences. These data will be used to assess the types of errors elicited by DAF and the relationship between these effects and responses to rapid shifts in the frequency content, rather than timing, of the feedback signal. The collected data and perceptual evaluations, obtained via a crowdsourcing platform, will enable the study of individual speaker variability. Data will also be made available as a large public database of speech under altered feedback conditions. The second research goal is to develop a computational model, informed also by kinematic measures of speech from a subset of participants, that can capture the interaction of auditory feedback with speech sequence production. The model will simulate a series of hypotheses about the interactions among speech perception and planning and production components and assess their ability to account for the patterns of errors observed in the experimental data.

The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, which is accompanied by excessive absorption of sunlight by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity.  The deficiency in simulated cloud cover is most pronounced in boundary layer and lower-tropospheric clouds (tops below 3km) in the cold, dry sectors of frontal weather systems traveling along the SO storm track.<br/><br/>The work funded under this award is part of a larger field campaign titled Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The primary activity of the campaign is the deployment of a Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The GV will be based in Hobart, Australia and make multiple flights across the South Polar front collecting data on SO clouds and the meteorological conditions in which they occur. The GV is equipped with dropsondes to record ambient meteorological conditions, radar and lidar to observe the clouds, and instruments mounted on the wings or positioned behind inlets to to sample, collect and analyze aerosols and cloud particles (liquid droplets and ice crystals). The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South.<br/><br/>A key issue to be addressed in the campaign is the relative abundance of supercooled liquid water (SLW) droplets and ice particles in SO clouds, as SLW is more prevalent in SO clouds than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The PIs hypothesize that the extent to which SLW cloud droplets freeze into ice particles is more strongly modulated in SO clouds by the vigor of cloud updrafts than by the availability of Ice nucleating particles (INPs, particles within liquid droplets which trigger freezing). The PIs also seek to determine the relative influence of overlying free tropospheric aerosol concentrations versus local surface and boundary layer controls, including precipitation and wind speed, in determining the concentration of liquid droplets in boundary layer clouds.<br/><br/>Work funded under this award contributes to SOCRATES by measuring aerosol and cloud hydrometeor properties, specifically addressing three questions (from the proposal summary):<br/><br/>1) What are the chemical and physical properties of sub-micron and coarse-mode aerosol particles in the region, and how do they relate to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN, particles around which cloud droplets form), INP, and cloud properties?<br/><br/>2) What fraction of SO condensed water remains supercooled as a function of temperature, and can this be related to a dearth of INPs?<br/><br/>3) What is the role of biological aerosol particles in cloud formation over the SO?<br/><br/>These questions are addressed through in-situ air sampling using inlets available on the GV.  Sampling of cloudy air uses a specialized inlet known as a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI), which separates cloud droplets and ice crystals from smaller aerosol particles and other non-cloud material. Droplets and ice crystals are heated in the CVI to evaporate their water substance and the resulting vapor is measured with a laser hygrometer to determine total condensed water content.  Once the water is evaporated the droplets and ice are reduced to their nucleating particles (referred to as residual particles), which are counted and sized using an aerosol spectrometer.  A fluorescence-based spectrometer is used to separately count and size biological particles so that their role in nucleation can be assessed.  Residual particles are collected on slides for laboratory analysis using electron and X-ray microscopy that can determine morphology, composition, and mixing state. A key question in the analysis is the hygroscopicity of the particles, meaning their ability to absorb water vapor and thus serve as CCN. Additional measurements from wing-mounted supercooled liquid probes are used to estimate the ratio of SLW to ice content in the clouds.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potentially significant role of SO clouds in determining the sensitivity of global climate to external forcing from greenhouse gas increases and other factors. Data from the campaign will be used to develop better representations of clouds in models used for weather prediction and climate impacts assessments. The data will be made available to the worldwide scientific community, thus the campaign has broader impacts by creating a community resource for basic science research.  A further contribution to basic research is the development of a clean-in-place system for the CVI inlet, which will improve the reliability of the CVI for future users, particular in salty marine environments.  Campaign outreach to K-12 students and the general public is conducted through regular newsletters and blogs, and an interactive ""Ask SOCRATES"" website. Events in which campaign videos, microscope images of cloud particles, and aerosol samples collected during the campaign are presented to the general public, are also planned.  This award provides support and training to a graduate student and funds the participation of a second student in the campaign, thereby contribution to the development of the future workforce in this research area."

The two-day conference has 18 speakers (six senior tenured faculty, six junior non-tenured faculty, six graduate students) and includes ample time for dissemination and discussion of new findings among conference participants, as well as a panel discussion to address open problems facing the financial community.  The conference provides an opportunity for junior financial mathematicians to confer with eminent scholars in the field.  The conference website is: http://depts.washington.edu/amath/wcmf/<br/><br/>With the recent financial crises and the continuous introduction of new regulations designed to safeguard the financial system, the landscape of financial markets is changing quickly.  These changes have opened up entirely new directions for research within the mathematical finance community.  It is the goal of the Eighth Western Conference on Mathematical Finance to highlight research in these newly developing areas.  In particular, a special emphasis is given to asymptotics for parabolic partial differential equations, robust hedging, and stochastic portfolio theory.  Cutting-edge developments in asymptotics are required in order to solve challenging nonlinear partial differential equations in various financial applications with market frictions such as trading constraints, transactions costs, and asymmetric borrowing and lending rates.  Robust hedging methods are needed in order for market participants to mitigate risk effectively in the face of model uncertainty. New results from stochastic portfolio theory can shed light on market structure and long-term investment choices."

The paired site design utilizes a bio-inspired approach, translating the paired catalytic site of enzymes into a heterogeneous catalytic material. The proposed work will focus on developing a hydrothermal synthesis method that will incorporate paired sites into the zeolite framework. The work will seek to tune the catalytic performance through changing the composition of the pairs to demonstrate the mechanistic impact of paired sites. The study will also develop advanced spectroscopic methods to help identify the formation of paired catalytic sites. The technological impact of the project can be substantial since it will add a new dimension to the ability to tune catalytic performance and provide a method to increase the selectivity for biomass conversion to fructose and decrease associated energy costs. Overall, this would create a more economically viable route than currently available to produce high fructose corn syrup, biomass-derived polymers, or commodity chemicals. The work will be performed by a diverse team of students that will be trained in advanced catalytic material synthesis and testing. In addition to undergraduate and graduate education opportunities, the project will interface with several existing programs at Ohio State University to create a classroom module for students and a project to introduce the concepts of size-selective separation of zeolitic materials ? a critical feature of these materials ? to elementary school children to inspire future generations to pursue education in STEM-related fields.

However, modern telescopes are only as good as the cameras and spectrometers used with them. It is therefore essential that a national observatory like Gemini continues to modernize the suite of instruments mounted on each telescope. The proposers aim to make available to the Gemini community an instrument that has already been built and tested on smaller telescopes. Funds are needed to support modest adaptation of the instrument so that it can be used on either Gemini telescope. The instrument, a spectrometer, will allow researches to analyze in great detail the infrared light from all manner of objects. Striking data have already been published and presented to the community at national astronomical meetings, demonstrating the power and versatility of the device. Important results and new discoveries are expected once the spectrometer is mounted on one of the much larger Gemini telescopes.<br/><br/>The proposal seeks to adapt the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS), a near-infrared (H- and K-band) high-resolution (R~45,000) single-object spectrometer for use on either the Gemini-North or Gemini-South telescope. The proposers will also provide observational support for the community.  IGRINS was built jointly by the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) as a precursor to a similar, future instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope. The instrument contains no moving parts and comes with an existing data reduction pipeline; the need for future development and support by Gemini staff is thus likely to be minimal. IGRINS has been used on the McDonald Observatory 2.7-meter telescope and at the 4.3-meter Discovery Channel Telescope, where its performance has been shown to exceed that of similar instruments at other 4-to-8 meter class telescopes. The proposers have already approached the observatory and have secured, through a competitive review process, 135 hours of telescope time in 2018 to pursue a ""Large and Long"" program to survey Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) and planetary systems in Ophiuchius. The data -- to be reduced and archived for public use -- will represent the most extensive high-resolution, high-S/N, spectral survey of YSOs obtained to date, and will be a valuable resource to the star formation community."

On the other hand, an important element absent from the classical statistical paradigm is the computational complexity of inference procedures, which is becoming increasingly relevant dealing with large-scale noisy datasets. The PI has detailed plans for mentoring both undergraduate and graduate students, targeting specifically at members of the under-represented communities.<br/><br/>Combining both statistical and computational perspectives, this research develops an interdisciplinary program aiming to advance the understanding of the fundamental inferential and algorithmic limits of statistical estimation on large domains and large networks, including functional estimation on large alphabets, learning graph properties with network sampling, extrapolating unseen species.

In addition to determining the statistical limits and designing efficient and scalable procedures, which provide key enabling technologies for such high-impact applications of data science as neuroscience, gene association networks, and social network analysis, a major innovation lies in rigorously identifying the optimal statistical performance under complexity constraints and, complementarity, understanding the inferential power and limitations of important classes of algorithms such as spectral methods, relaxation hierarchies, and message-passing algorithms."

This failure is attributed to the limited ability of adult mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes (CMs = heart muscle cells) to divide and regenerate the lost myocardium.  In contrast, zebrafish hearts fully regenerate after 20% ventricular removal and thus provide a genetically tractable model system for heart regeneration investigations.  While the zebrafish heart has been extensively assessed using immunohistochemistry and DNA and protein analyses to study the roles of different signaling pathways in cardiac development and regeneration, which is thought to have relevance for developing mammalian regeneration therapies, current approaches cannot elucidate the progress of the process (i.e., regeneration) of the same samples over time.  The objective of this project, which builds on the PI's demonstrated ability to obtain quality (favorable high signal to noise ratio) electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in sedated animals, is to provide revolutionary polymer-based wireless devices for long-term acquisition of intrinsic ECG in freely swimming zebrafish models of heart regeneration.  Broader society interests include the promise 1) to enable novel cardiac therapy; 2) to reduce cost and time of drug screening; and 3) to pave the way for numerous comfortable patch-based healthcare wearables for both patients and healthy populations.  Integration of research with education activities are designed to help close the gap of engineering education and biomedical research, including efforts to 1) inspire and train students from different disciplinary and levels to follow higher education and a bioengineering career; 2) to nurture K-12 students directly and indirectly through their teachers by broadening knowledge in state-of-the-art hi-technology applied in bioengineering and medical research; 3) to translate cutting-edge technologies used in rigorous research to real world devices directly supporting society; 4) to engage multidisciplinary personnel from engineering, science and medicine to tackle unmet bioengineering challenge; and 5) to establish international collaborations to exchange innovations as well as to address global issues such as water quality.<br/><br/>Unlike mammalian hearts, which have limited ability to regenerate myocardium after ischemia induced infarct due to the limited capacity of adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) to divide and proliferate, zebrafish (Danio rerio) hearts fully regenerate after 20% ventricular resection.  The central theme of this project lies in the applications of flexible and stretchable microelectronics and wireless power transfer to carry out heart regeneration studies in freely swimming zebrafish models.  The project involves three milestones: 1) Development of flexible and stretchable micro-electrode array (MEA) membranes for long-term recording of electrocardiogram (ECG) in zebrafish models of heart regeneration:  Four working electrodes approximately 200 um in diameter will be placed near the heart and a reference electrode will reside on the body.  2) Design and implementation of a wireless system (an ""ECG Jacket"") including wireless powering (inductive coupling or ultrasound) and data communication for remote and continuous electrocardiac monitoring of freely swimming fish (multiple fish monitored simultaneously) in a circular tank under biological investigations.   3) Deploying the system to elucidate the roles of specific genes towards myocardium regeneration in zebrafish (multiple mutant-like models with injuries induced by either amputation or a cryogenic approach) with potential translations to humans and to demonstrate the translational potentials for i) drug screening (zebrafish will be treated with well-known drugs that affect cardiac activity, e.g. amiodarone and verapamiland) and ii) physiological monitoring in humans with comfortable (flexible and stretchable) and unobtrusive patch-based devices (e.g., ECG, EEG, EOG, EMG, and blood pressure) in the home setting.  The technologies developed will enable long-term (up to 2 months) ECG recordings of specific myocardial sites and thus uniquely determine the overall functionality of the area under investigation without effects of sedation. The conventional view of mammalian hearts as having virtually no regenerative capacity is now questioned by recent animal and human studies, in which new CMs may arise from existing CMs and progenitor or stem cells. The discovery of specific genes' roles towards heart regeneration in zebrafish studies would suggest methods to activate limited regenerative capacity in the human heart, garnering optimism about potential cardiac therapies."

The low temperature silver reactive inks are projected to use 90 percent less silver than traditional screen-printing technologies. Additionally the low temperature process will use significantly less energy and utilize equipment with relatively low capital expenditures requirements and high throughputs. This technique is of particular importance to temperature sensitive devices and substrates, not only because the reactive inks do not require firing but also because low temperature screen printing silver paste are costly, even more so than their high temperature counterparts. Thus the path envisioned for this technology not only can radically change the cost structure of solar cells but it also has the potential of affecting other markets such as wearable electronics, flexible displays and building integrated devices.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops findings in the field of evaporation-confined adhesion promotion and reactive ink chemistry. It is based on application of reactive inks to photovoltaics, optimization of adhesion pretreatments, and understanding of printing and drying kinetics of the multiple chemical solutions involved in the process. It has been demonstrated that the process can reduce silver consumption by an order of magnitude and obtain comparable high efficiency to a screen-printed heterojuntion device. It has been further demonstrated that the reactive silver metallization is compatible with the state-of-the-art smart wiring technology for module assembly, reducing the silver consumption even further. It has also been shown that the reactive ink printed modules can withstand damp heat accelerated testing without any signs of performance loses, corrosion or delamination of the modules."

However, recent reports on conventional, carbon-supported, reduced Pt-loading PEFC electrodes have shown significant performance losses due to oxygen transport resistance through a thin-film ionomer at high current-densities. These findings have motivated a search for alternative electrode designs that do not rely on ionomers for proton conduction. Nano-structured thin-film electrodes and several other extended-surface area electrodes have demonstrated promising power densities and durability, however underlying ion transport mechanisms and associated reaction kinetic pathways are still ill understood. The proposed project aims to determine the specific factors which limit performance of PEFCs using thin-film electrodes and allow for work to progress on overcoming these hurdles. The PI plans to integrate research findings into teaching and develop a broad range of educational and outreach activities to a diverse range of K-12 students, including underrepresented minorities, to foster excitement about renewable-energy and STEM careers.<br/><br/>The proposed research has three main objectives: (1) Elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of ion transport in water-filled Pt and dispersed, carbon-supported Pt electrodes. (2) Establish the operational window (current, temperature and relative humidity) for ion-conduction mechanisms under oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) currents. (3) Determine the participating ions and mechanisms that occur in ORR in water-filled electrodes and create tailored electrode designs to enhance the rate of ORR. The separation of competing ion transport mechanisms will be accomplished through ex-situ four-point probe experiments combined with in-operando electrochemical techniques and modeling studies. The proposed work has the potential to advance the current understanding of the mechanisms of ion transport in ionomer-free PEFC electrodes."

Therefore, an urgent need exists for a better understanding of disease progress in aged tissues in order to find ways to decrease age-related problems.  This project focuses on establishing a unique tissue engineered model system of the aging human myocardium that can be used to investigate the role of the aging tissue microenvironment on cell survival after a heart attack/myocardial infarction (MI).  The novel model overcomes limitations 1) of animal models that have limited applicability to the human condition and involve complex systems with difficult to control parameters and 2) of cell culture models that are oversimplified.   Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that the aging tissue microenvironment (i.e., biochemical composition and biophysical properties such as stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM)) affects cell survival after MI, and the decreased cellular communication due to cellular damage is the cause of increased cell death in older tissues.  Research and education are integrated through undergraduate and graduate training and mentoring activities and a three-day summer workshop titled ""Peace through Science"" that aims to leverage science to teach tolerance and inclusion.<br/><br/>As part of the long-term career goal to establish a research program focused on biomimetic engineered model tissues to investigate the multicellular communication and cell-microenvironment interactions in healthy and diseased tissues, the focus of this project is the first study to demonstrate that tissue engineering and microfabrication can create highly impactful aging-mimicking disease models and that these models can be used to elucidate the role of aging on a specific disease--myocardial infarction. Specific hypotheses to be tested are: 1) matrix age affects cell survival due to altered biochemical and biophysical matrix content by age, 2) chronological age of cells affects cell survival due to altered paracrine factor secretion by the cells by age and 3) cellular damage that accumulates by age in myocardial tissue causes decreased cellular function and interaction, resulting in increased cell death upon MI in older tissues.  The related research objectives are to 1) create an aging mimicking myocardial model tissue that can be used to simulate MI conditions and 2) study the effect of the aging tissue microenvironment on cell survival upon MI.  The engineered myocardial tissue model will be microfabricated using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial and myocardial cells, biomimetic hydrogels and microfluidics.  Cellular communication will be studied under MI-mimicking conditions (i.e., hypoxia, nutrient starvation, reperfusion and oxidative stress.)  The knowledge gained using this model tissue will unravel the cellular communication within normal, aging and diseased myocardium and will shed light on both the cell-level phenomena upon MI and on the nature of aging itself.  As only 10% of therapies that are shown to be successful in animal models pass clinical trials, engineered tissue models using human cells are gaining much interest due to their advantages over animal models and their potential to increase clinical translation of basic science by filling the gap between in vitro and in vivo studies."

According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc.<br/><br/>Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain.  Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines."

Some of the most exciting advances are being driven by Laser-Ablation ICP Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), which generates U-Th-Pb ages and complementary geochemical information rapidly, with micron-scale spatial resolution, and with the precision necessary to address a wide range of problems in Earth Science. The Arizona LaserChron Center (ALC) is a multi-user facility that utilizes LA-ICPMS to determine U-Th-Pb ages, Hf isotope ratios, and trace element abundances from a variety of minerals that occur in sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. We also utilize a dedicated Scanning Electron Microscope that generates the high-resolution and high-magnification images necessary for state-of-the-art micro-analysis. Primary goals of the ALC are to (1) generate robust geochronologic and geochemical data in support of many different NSF-funded projects, (2) use every aspect of facility operation as an opportunity to train faculty and student researchers in geochronologic theory and methodology, and (3) drive the development of new techniques and applications that take advantage of the high efficiency and fine spatial resolution of LA-ICPMS. Research at the ALC is conducted in a highly collaborative mode, with ALC scientists providing assistance with all aspects of a project (from initial design of the study to final publication of results) and faculty members and students from other institutions visiting the lab to generate their own data and learn the theory and methodology of U-Th-Pb geochronology.<br/><br/>Funding from this award will enable the ALC to facilitate the acquisition of geochronologic information in support of a large number of NSF-funded projects. These projects focus on generating new knowledge about the growth of continents, processes of mountain building, generation and dispersal of sediment, formation of mineral and hydrocarbon resources, history of evolutionary changes, and genetic linkages between climate and tectonics. The ALC will also continue to help drive the development of numerous new analytical techniques, applications, and instruments. Educational activities will include hosting visits from several hundred faculty and student researchers per year, teaching short courses at annual meetings, developing materials that can be used in Earth Science courses, creating new tools for displaying and interpreting geochronologic data, and driving the development of a global database ?Geochron? that hosts U-Th-Pb geochronologic information."

The African easterly jet often gives birth to weather systems known as African easterly waves. Together the jet and the waves form a complex system whose influence on weather can extend to the United States. That influence often manifests as tropical cyclones, whose genesis has been linked to the easterly waves. Consequently, to understand the connection between the weather over North Africa and the development of tropical cyclones, it is important to understand the processes that affect the African easterly jet&#8210;African easterly wave system. Of those processes, the heating effects of Saharan dust storms are among the least understood, yet potentially among the most important. The central objective of this proposal is to advance understanding of the effects of Saharan dust storms on the intra-seasonal and inter-annual variability of the African easterly jet&#8210;African easterly wave system. To achieve this objective, a unified work plan is developed that combines numerical experiments, observational analysis, and model verification. To guide the numerical experiments and to aid in the interpretation of the results, a theoretical framework will be developed that exposes the dust-modified physics operating within the system. <br/><br/>The scientific merits of the proposed research include: understanding the pathways that communicate the effects of Saharan dust to the African easterly jet&#8210;African easterly wave system; providing a physical basis for explaining how Saharan dust affects the temporal variability of the system; and evaluating the importance of Saharan dust to the life cycles of the easterly waves. The broader impacts of the proposed research include: additional understanding of how Saharan dust affects the circulation over North Africa, which will aid the scientific community?s efforts to improve weather forecasts for the region; improved representation of the dust-modified system, which will benefit future studies that seek to advance understanding and improve forecasting of tropical cyclones over the Eastern Atlantic Ocean; development of a theoretical framework for understanding the dust-modified circulation, which can be used as an interpretive tool for numerical modeling and observational studies of the weather over North Africa; and the scientific training of undergraduate and graduate students in the discipline of atmospheric sciences."

Tradeoffs between male reproductive effort and immune function underlie several theories about the evolution of human biology. The investigator will explore these theories by testing how individual physiology (including testosterone in men) is associated with immune responses to infection by parasites, and how lifestyle variation influences this relationship, in a population with a high parasitic disease burden. Infection patterns identified in this study may help to inform treatment protocols by measuring how individual physiology (hormone levels) and lifestyle (diet and housing factors) affect parasite exposure and infectious disease risk. Furthermore, these analyses will improve the health of individuals at the study location through education and treatment of infections. The project will support undergraduate and graduate training and mentorship in STEM research. <br/><br/>This project evaluates predicted life history compromises between male reproductive effort and immune function among the Shuar. Life history theory (LHT) seeks to explain the timing and context-sensitive allocation of energetic resources to critical physical and reproductive functions. A critical premise of LHT is that resources used for one function cannot be used for another; thus, tradeoffs are predicted among different aspects of physical and reproductive investment. These tradeoffs are physiologically regulated, including via hormone levels. For example, the hormone testosterone (T) is thought to mediate tradeoffs between reproductive effort and immunity. Work with non-human animals has shown T to generally increase investment in physical traits associated with male reproduction (e.g., musculature) while suppressing immune function. However, this tradeoff is not well-tested in humans. The Shuar experience a relatively high pathogen environment, with subsequent increases in immune activation costs. Further, pathogen exposure varies across their territory, and in relation to their access to economic resources. This setting provides an excellent opportunity for testing the hypothesized relations among T profile, immunity, and reproductive investment. To test these associations several measures will be collected, including the presence of observable parasite species and eggs per gram in fresh fecal samples; T levels from saliva samples; physical measures thought to be associated with developmental T levels (height, grip strength, chest compression, upper arm circumference, and 2D:4D digit ratio); immune markers from dried blood spots; and household economic, dietary, and style of life questionnaire data. In addition, this study will assess if T profiles vary between traditionally-living and urbanized Shuar in relation to differences in pathogen exposure. This work will therefore contribute to our understanding of human life history, male reproduction, and health through documenting tradeoffs between reproduction and immune responses, two energetically expensive functions."

Because mathematics is a fundamental part of all STEM disciplines, success of undergraduate students in mathematics is a crucial ingredient in addressing this challenge. This ""TPSE Math Chairs+1 Conference #2"" project, with leadership team from the Transforming Post-Secondary Education in Mathematics (TPSE Math) group, will organize and convene a conference primarily of mathematical sciences department chairs and other academic leaders from a diverse set of institutions of higher education from across the country. This is the second conference of this nature with the first having been held in October, 2016 (NSF 1651738). Workshop topics will include several key questions and issues to be addressed to catalyze improved teaching, learning, retention, and overall student success in undergraduate mathematics. <br/><br/>Although recent education research has provided the STEM education community with indications and suggestions for various directions for change to improve undergraduate teaching and student learning, this community as a whole has not always been quick to foster such changes. Among the purposes of the workshop will be to encourage more collaboration among members of the mathematics community, help department chairs develop capacities to catalyze change in their own departments, and serve as a vehicle for chairs with common interests to work together for change after the conference, especially in areas of developing more diverse and modern curricula for mathematics majors and non-mathematics majors alike. To help guide the discussion and conference outcomes, the conference organizers with input from participants plan to address a wide range of questions and determine research needed to address them. The questions and categories include: (1) What do the various STEM disciplines want for their students who take mathematics? What mathematical training do other disciplines want for their majors? Is this training appropriate for careers in those disciplines? (2) What kinds of mathematical sciences training do employers want? Do employers in fact know what mathematics training can be most useful for their employees? (3) <br/>What are the levels of career satisfaction experienced by students who have - and have not - taken particular mathematics courses or pathways? (4) What menu of mathematics training best supports basic numeracy (general quantitative and reasoning skills) for citizens in today's society? and (5) Why are the current post-secondary pathways variations of algebra and calculus unsatisfactory? What should replace them? The conference also will showcase extant models, resources, and research results, and participants will be asked to suggest how they can be adopted, adapted, disseminated, scaled up, and evaluated, and to recommend what additional research is needed."

The reduction of parasite infections in these populations may be related reduced gut microbiome diversity and the increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases in the industrialized world. This project will advance our understanding of human biology and the co-evolution of species, while supporting student training and inclusion of underserved groups in scientific research. A series of scientific computing workshops will be offered through the Center on American Indian and Alaska Native Genomic Research and made available to the general public to encourage continued scientific education. Given that parasite infection remains a major source of morbidity and mortality world-wide, procedures developed in this project for the detection and analysis of parasites will be disseminated through international partnerships in regions where these types of infections pose a major public health concern.<br/> <br/>This project investigates whether the loss of parasites in the industrialized gut can explain the loss of microbial diversity in these micro-ecosystems. Using fecal samples from five geographically and culturally variable populations including industrialized peoples in the United States, and traditional peoples in South America and Africa, this study proposes to (1) describe the impact of parasites on the human gut microbiome, and (2) document the influence of lifestyle including subsistence strategy on parasite diversity in traditional and industrialized societies. Parasite DNA sequenced from samples collected for this study will be compared to bacterial community data using a variety of statistical procedures to detect whole community as well as functional shifts that may be linked to parasite infection."

This meeting entitled, ""International Conference on Substorms (ICS13)"" will be held in Portsmouth, New Hampshire during 24-29 September 2017.  The ICS13 will be the 13th in a series of carefully-designed substorm conferences that build on past advances while incorporating the latest new development.  The venue is aimed at creating a forum to bring together a worldwide cadre of substorm researchers (and students) to focus their combined talents as well as theoretical and observational assets on accelerating progress towards a fundamental understanding of substorm physics.  Such an environment, which intermixes a wide variety of viewpoints and diverse participants, provides a known incubator for new and innovative approaches that have the potential for enabling breakthroughs.  This environment is also a valuable educational experience for students and an opportunity for international networking.  The dates for the workshop were selected so that scientific team meetings for several operating scientific missions making relevant measurements might be organized to overlap with the conference.  As many as 150 participants are anticipated with an estimated 35 participants requiring travel support - half of this participant support is requested from NSF, the other half from NASA.  Following the event, a peer-reviewed conference proceedings will be published in an open-access, electronic-only periodical to enable broad dissemination of the results.<br/><br/>Geomagnetic substorms, the topical focus of the conference, are explosive energy releases in geospace that have disruptive consequences in regions from near-Earth space, where weather, communications and national security satellites orbit; to the underlying upper atmosphere and ionosphere, where associated mega-ampere currents flow endangering vulnerable assets both in low-earth orbit and on the ground.  There is even evidence to suggest that effects of this disruption may penetrate into the middle atmosphere through chemical-dynamical processes with potential, but so-far elusive, effects on ozone and climate variability.  The triggers of these explosive energy releases are still not fully resolved and debates over the underlying mechanisms fuel one of the most long-lived controversies in geospace research.  The complicated nature of the phenomenon and the associated difficult progress toward understanding are creating impediments to developing modeling and predictive capabilities, a situation that highlights the importance of international workshops for focusing global knowledge towards a resolution."

However, by the standard economic view, any information is valuable only if it improves decision-making. This implies no willingness to pay for non-essential information.  Experimental data, however, documents the opposite phenomena. This project tests if demand for such non-essential information diminishes in situations where the best choice satisfies a stronger solution concept in game theory. Accounting for the cognitive cost of reasoning may explain why information that may be non-instrumental in theory might nevertheless be important for less than fully rational players. The results of the proposed study will have fundamental implications for economic theory in general and applications such as disclosure of information in implementing mechanisms or policy implementation. <br/><br/>The proposed research is aimed at experimental investigation of willingness to pay for non-instrumental information in games with incomplete information where the optimal strategy is either just dominant strategy or obviously dominant strategy, an even stronger solution concept. The project will address fundamental questions about behavior in games with dominant strategy: Is it costly to figure out dominant strategy when it is not obviously enough, and do cognitive costs associated with such obviousness affect the demand of non-instrumental information?<br/><br/>The primary approach of the proposed research manipulates the payoff tables of a one-shot normal form game with incomplete information. In all the treatments, the optimal choice is dominant strategy, but might not be obviously dominant strategy. We ask subjects if they are willing to pay a fee to learn the state of nature or the strategy of the opponent. The information will not change the dominant strategy. However, if subjects have difficulty with dominant strategy because of its un-obviousness, they may be willing to pay for such information when the optimal choice is not obviously dominant strategy. Moreover, if subjects have no other reasons for demanding the information, they should not choose to pay the fee when the optimal choice is already obviously dominant strategy. Following the main experiment, all subjects will be asked to participate in a voting game, proposed by Esponda and Vespa (2014) to tests the subjects? abilities of hypothetical thinking. This additional task allows us to investigate whether the choice of paying for non-instrumental information is related to the subjects? ability in hypothetical reasoning, and to verify whether their failure to recognize dominant strategy but not obviously dominant strategy is consistent across different environments."

Northern Illinois University's (NIU's) model of undergraduate research builds research teams where students and student-faculty pairs are recruited from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMPs), and Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) with limited research opportunities. Each REU project is supplemented with computational components to expand the students' experience. REU students have research experiences within broad scientific themes such as nanotechnology, homeland security, drug design, energy research, and chemical biology. Students are trained in instrumentation to build new skills to complement their experimental research. In addition, three of the eight students each year work with two faculty mentors in the laboratory (home institution and NIU) and consult with a computational faculty liaison from NIU. <br/><br/>The program tests the hypothesis that strong financial and infrastructure support of research collaborations invigorate faculty from PUIs who in turn, directly impact students and learning environments at their home institutions. The program aims to establish meaningful, year round, long-term research collaborations. The model is envisioned to be self-perpetuating because the collaborations ultimately mature to independent funding, and are replaced by new collaborations between the host institution and new participants. The activities support the intent of the REU program to use meaningful research experiences to attract and retain the nation's diverse student talent pool.

This project builds on the successful Portal to the Public (PoP) framework, bringing together the expertise and resources of HEIs and ISEs around the shared mission of engaging public audiences in current STEM research. The project is designed to address several critical needs: (1) Public outreach BI activities are relatively uncommon compared to BI that is focused within the infrastructure of academia; (2) Because collaborations with ISEs are frequently tied to individual Principal Investigators (PIs), there is limited opportunity to build a body of knowledge around the practice of partnering for BI work; and (3) Collaborations are often transient, making it more difficult for universities to view BI on an institutional level in ways that leverage particular institutional assets or strategies and even link investigators from multiple projects.<br/><br/>The specific areas of study are: <br/>a.  Develop and test a structure for education/outreach BI experience design that addresses a public audience need and meets NSF's BI criterion: The project will create disseminatable tools around the activity design process (including evaluation of learning impacts). By convening cross-disciplinary teams, the project will ensure that experiences will reflect a wide range of expertise and will help meet the needs of multiple stakeholders.

This warming has increased disturbances such as wildfire as well as thawing of permafrost in ecosystems of Northern Alaska.  As a result of this warming and increased disturbance, animal and plant communities on land and in streams and lakes are changing.  Underlying these community changes are changes in the availability and cycling of nutrients, in the amount of carbon stored in soils and vegetation, and in the exchange of carbon dioxide and nutrients between arctic landscapes and the atmosphere and downstream rivers and oceans. Collectively, these changes may have profound effects, not just on the arctic ecosystems, but globally, with implications for humans. A better understanding of these changes can lead to better predictions of the future, and those predictions could provide the basis for better planning. To understand these changes, scientists with the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (ARC-LTER) Project monitor long-term changes in terrestrial, stream, and lake ecosystems in the vicinity of Toolik Lake, Alaska.  They make observations of the recovery of these ecosystems from natural and experimentally imposed disturbances, and initiate and maintain long-term experiments designed to understand interactions among arctic species, nutrient cycles, and the connections among terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the arctic landscape.  Scientists working at the ARC-LTER site will engage students from Barrow, Alaska, run a program for journalists, and participate in short courses for Alaskan Natives in three communities, all designed to increase the public understanding of Arctic Ecology.  Briefings to national and state land managers and resource managers will help provide scientific knowledge that can inform policy.<br/><br/>The research is organized around the concepts of ecosystem openness and landscape connectivity. Biogeochemical openness is the degree to which ecosystems depend on external sources of nutrients and organic carbon versus nutrients recycled within the ecosystem and organic carbon produced locally by photosynthesis.  Community openness is the degree to which the movement of organisms in and out of the ecosystem determines community and food-web structure.  Finally, landscape connectivity describes the nature and strength of interactions among ecosystems on the landscape and the resultant propagation of responses to disturbances across the landscape.  Components of the arctic landscape differ widely in biogeochemical and community openness.  Research at the ARC-LTER will compare key ecosystems of the Arctic to determine how their degree of openness governs their responses to climate variation and to acute disturbance such as fire and surface slumping associated with permafrost thaw.  The proposed research will also determine how the responses to climate and disturbance are mediated by landscape connectivity and the movement of nutrients, carbon, and organisms across arctic landscapes. To accomplish these goals, ARC-LTER research will include continued long-term fertilizer and warming experiments; monitoring of chemical budgets, community changes, and species movements; monitoring recovery of tundra, rivers, and lakes that were previously fertilized; establishing new larger greenhouses in different aged landscapes; blocking fish movement into a lake connected to migratory streams and adding fish to a lake currently isolated from a stream network; and searching for correlations between terrestrial production and aquatic metabolism and nutrient concentrations. This research will support two undergraduate student researchers per year and provide opportunities for students working on other projects to work on Arctic LTER sites and experiments."

With increased penetration of community microgrids and distributed energy resources, distribution systems are transforming from traditionally passive radial networks operated by a single utility to more sophisticated active networked topologies with multiple autonomic entities.  This transformation in distribution systems has resulted in a need to reshape the way electricity services are delivered and distribution systems are designed and managed.  To address these challenges, this CAREER project will investigate new approaches for comprehensive modeling of distinct characteristics of emerging distribution systems with a proliferation of community microgrids, and explore optimal operation strategies for enhancing the sustainability and resiliency of distribution systems.  Specifically, a two-tier hierarchical restructuring framework is proposed for guiding the optimal operation and coordination of distribution systems and community microgrids, with special focus on investigating fundamental market clearing mechanisms and efficient computation tools.  Results from this research could facilitate the optimal design of future fully liberalized retail distribution markets and related energy policies, and guide the active participation of microplayer-like electricity prosumers (producer-consumers) in such distribution-level markets.  The research efforts will be complemented by an education and outreach plan aimed at increasing public awareness and understanding of the complexity of distribution systems restructuring, and to prepare the next generation workforce with needed skills to meet the needs of the power industry.<br/><br/>Both physical feasibility and financial viability of individual autonomic entities are key to the successful implementation of distribution system restructuring and retail electricity markets.  This project will address such challenges via five integrated research and educational activities, namely: (i) Exploring market operation and pricing mechanisms for distribution system operators based on comprehensive unbalanced three-phase alternating current optimal power flow models and efficient computation methods.  The proposed per-phase nodal distribution locational marginal pricing concept can effectively incentivize the continued participation of various distribution customers in retail electricity markets;  (ii) Investigating market operation and pricing mechanisms for community microgrid operators based on comprehensive unbalanced three-phase alternating current unit commitment models and efficient computation methods.  The proposed per-phase nodal community locational marginal pricing concept can effectively coordinate heterogeneous community partners under both grid-connected and islanded operation modes, and incentivize their continued participation in community microgrids.  Flexibilities of typical community microgrid partners are also investigated to help guide their strategic bidding in community microgrids;  (iii) Addressing major research questions via the proposed models and computation methods to further promote the implementation of distribution systems restructuring;  (iv) Validating the proposed research in simulated and realistic system models;  and (v) Exploring knowledge and skill requirements for the sustainable operation and effective restructuring of emerging distribution systems and community microgrids, and investigating education and training needs for retooling existing power engineering programs and curricula."

The productive and diverse nature of rivers and their floodplains and the ecosystem services they provide is greatly influenced by and dependent on river-floodplain connectivity. Losses in river-floodplain connectivity due to human impacts across the globe has been well documented, but quantifying these losses has been complicated by a lack of formal framework for quantifying landscape connectivity within floodplains. This project will develop a framework that combines the hydrologic surface connectivity concept with graph/network theory. Such a framework will help advance scientific understanding of river-floodplain processes as it will consistently quantify measures and ultimately permit these systems to be categorized and compared using a standard approach. Moreover, this more standard approach will find a useful application in the development of environmental flow policies for many rivers.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Graph theory has been widely used within the fields of hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology to characterize connectivity and its attributes within landscape systems. This makes graph theory well-suited for the development of a framework for characterizing river-floodplain systems using a landscape connectivity perspective. The two objectives of this project are: (1) to quantitatively determine how hydrologic surface connectivity varies within a specific river-floodplain system for the four methods (morphometric analyses, field-based direct measurements, image analyses, and numerical modeling) commonly used to analyze hydrologic surface connectivity; and (2) to evaluate the similarities and differences amongst the family of hydrologic surface connectivity indicators and to determine the effectiveness with which each method captures attributes of the riverine landscape system. The first objective will be addressed by applying graph theoretical measures for quantifying landscape connectivity to estimates of hydrologic surface connectivity determined using field data, imagery analysis, and modelling techniques. These have been used in the past, but not consistently.  The second objective will be addressed using results from the first objective in order to compare estimates of connectivity and its attributes for each approach used in determining hydrologic surface connectivity. The similarities and differences amongst the connectivity measures will be used to determine how well each method for analyzing hydrologic surface connectivity captures aspects of river-floodplain process. A case study of the Mission River in Texas will be used to develop this framework and determine its utility."

Freshwater mussels are one of the most threatened aquatic organisms in North America, and much work has been conducted to understand and conserve them.  It is hypothesized here that freshwater mussels can survive for relatively long time periods (up to several decades) at a given river location even during high flow events with much sediment in motion.  To do this, mussels may have special adaptations that enable them to remain in place on a river bed during high flow stages.  Field surveys, numerical modeling, and experimental facilities will demonstrate that mussels on river beds can remain in place for relatively long time periods, to show that the forces required to move mussels out of their burrows are higher than expected values, and to illustrate that mussels can alter the flow within a river to aid in their long-term survival.  This work seeks to provide critical information on those processes that enable mussels to thrive in rivers, which then could be used to aid conservation efforts.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in field, experimental, and numerical methods employed in rivers and aquatic ecology, providing them the necessary skills for their future careers.  Lastly, an innovative interdisciplinary research team will be assembled to advance the fundamental understanding of how aquatic organisms interact with river flow.<br/><br/>Freshwater mussels (Unionidae) are one of the most imperiled aquatic organisms in North American rivers and much effort has been expended to understand their precipitous decline.  The current paradigm is that the relative stability (immobility) of river beds over long time periods (decades) is a critical component to the ecological success and resiliency of mussels.  Yet such information is in stark contrast to the central understanding of self-formed rivers.  This research program is designed to examine the fundamental interactions between near-bed turbulent flow and sediment transport within sand- and gravel-bedded rivers with labile beds populated by benthic organisms.  The focus for this study is an imperiled freshwater mussel, which can be considered an ""ecologic engineer.""  It is hypothesized that (1) benthic organisms like freshwater mussels can thrive for relatively long time periods (ca. decades) at-a-station in dynamic, self-made river systems with labile channel beds, and that these same reaches often experience channel-forming discharges, (2) entrainment thresholds for selected live benthic organisms in labile river beds are measurably greater than fully-equivalent non-cohesive sediment particles due to biophysical adaptations (ecological engineering), and (3) the constructive interference of near-bed flow, turbulence, roughness, and ecological engineering adaptations create a hydrodynamic emergent phenomenon, a ""tipping-point,"" that increases the stability of labile river beds at relatively high flow stages.  First, field surveys and numerical modeling will be employed at selected reaches of two streams with historically- and ecologically-significant mussel populations to demonstrate unequivocally the persistence of mussel beds in labile river channels.  Second, laboratory experiments, also supported by numerical modeling, will directly measure the lift and drag forces acting on burrowed mussels, with and without active filtering, to assess entrainment thresholds and near-bed hydrodynamics.  Third, a combined experimental and numerical modeling campaign will quantify the emergence of a hydrodynamic ""tipping-point"" wherein the fluid drag acting on a mussel-covered bed becomes reduced through the constructive interference of variable boundary conditions.  This work seeks to demonstrate that evolutionary adaptations promote hydrodynamic conditions beneficial to the persistence and survival of mussels in rivers."

Powder bed fusion based additive manufacturing technology is one of the most versatile and commercialized advances of all additive manufacturing techniques for the fabrication of metallic components. It enables a high degree of design freedom, development of novel material structures, and manufacture of customized products at reasonable costs. Powder bed fusion requires the use of high power energy beams to melt the powder particles and fuse them together layer after layer to form the desired shape. The complex thermal history experienced by the particles usually causes the formation of more defects, significant stresses and distortion as well as cracks in the fabricated materials. This research project will develop modeling and computational capabilities for the analysis of powder bed fusion based additive manufacturing processes and to understand the fundamental relationship between the processing parameters and the defect formation in the materials microstructure, to fabricate better metallic products. The research will also be complemented by establishing a responsive and flexible educational and outreach program based on curriculum development, training demonstrations in an additive manufacturing studio, and K-12 and underrepresented minority outreach through an institutional STEM education center.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to discover the process-microstructure-property relationship for powder bed fusion based additive manufacturing of metals. It is an established fact that the melt pool dynamics governs the defect formation in the microstructure of printed metals and determines the fabricated part?s macroscopic properties and performance. Thus, the research objectives of this project include: (i) development of a high performance computing based numerical solver for strong thermomechanical and fluid-structure coupled problems; (ii) capability to perform direct numerical simulation of powder bed fusion processes; (iii) model-based uncertainty quantification and certification of printed metals. The following fundamental questions will be answered: (1) what is the thermodynamic response of the powder bed under severe thermomechanical loading conditions; (2) what are the roles of processing parameters and powder characteristics in the microstructure evolution of fabricated materials. The overarching focus will be on obtaining a better understanding of the physics of defect formation and evolution, including: porosity, unmelted particles, grain boundaries and micro-cracks, during the powder bed fusion processes. This project will allow the PI to advance the knowledge base in computational science, mechanics and material science, and establish his long-term career in advanced manufacturing."

This project focuses on the Shatsky Rise large igneous province (LIP) in the western Pacific Ocean.  Shatsky Rise has a volume of 3.2-6.9 million cubic kilometers and an area roughly the same as California.  Seafloor magnetic and bathymetric data suggest that this LIP began to form 140-150 million years ago, at or near a setting in the plate tectonic system called a ridge-ridge-ridge triple junction.  Ridge-ridge-ridge triple junctions occur when three divergent spreading centers meet in a single area; the triple junction associated with Shatsky Rise marked the intersection of the Pacific, Izanagi, and Farallon plates.  The high magmatic fluxes inferred for Shatsky Rise, particularly for Tamu Massif in the southern portion of the plateau, have led previous investigations to suggest that a thermal plume or chemical heterogeneity in the mantle was the source of the magmatism.  This project aims to investigate the importance of triple junction plate boundary configuration in the formation of Shatsky Rise.  Understanding how the tectonic plates controlled the three-dimensional flow patterns in the upper mantle beneath Shatsky Rise is crucial to unraveling how this voluminous LIP formed.  Two undergraduate students will participate in this project.  One student will concentrate on the modeling component of the project, while the other will develop STEM education materials on geological processes that generate LIPs, with Shatsky Rise as the example.  <br/><br/>The project addresses several outstanding questions: (1) What was the nature of plate-driven, three-dimensional mantle flow at the triple junction where Shatsky Rise was emplaced? (2) Did triple junction geometry cause flow along the ridge axes that could have influenced the spatial dispersion of a mantle plume or geochemical heterogeneity? (3) What was the magnitude of upwelling velocity at the triple junction? (4) What was the shape and size of the three-dimensional mantle volume that experienced melting, and did ridge-related upwelling extend over anomalous depths compared to a setting where only two plates diverge? and (5) What was the degree of melting, compared to normal mid-ocean ridge basalt?  Unraveling the geological processes that contributed to the emplacement of Shatsky Rise is challenging, particularly since considerable time has elapsed since this LIP began to form and no direct observational method can be used to characterize the mantle plume or geochemical heterogeneity that may have been associated with it.  There are, however, relatively abundant marine geophysical and geological data available for the Shatsky Rise region, which enable modeling of plate-boundary-related processes.  This project uses a finite element model of the Pacific-Izanagi-Farallon triple junction to constrain how mantle upwelled in response to the divergence of three plates.  Models incorporate the geometry of the Pacific-Izanagi-Farallon triple junction from plate reconstructions, realistic relative plate motion vectors, and particle tracking to follow the advection of mantle material.  A subset of models also includes treatment of mantle dehydration viscosity and the effect of triple junction plate boundary migration.  The model calculations can be compared to existing seafloor data and geochemical analyses to improve inferences about the nature, location, and spatial dispersion of heterogeneous mantle material involved in Shatsky Rise formation."

Commitment devices are a natural way to adjust inefficient behavior that stems from present-bias, yet we see very little take-up of commitment. A recent vein of economic literature focuses on explaining this ""missing commitment"". The key idea behind this project is that uncertainty, both about a person?s self-control and about costs she may face in the future, might be driving low commitment take-up. In this research, I attempt to establish that people are uncertain about their self-control, that uncertainty explains low commitment take-up, that flexible commitment devices may help increase commitment take-up, and that a relational component may make flexible commitment devices more valuable and effective. The results of this research can help recommend policies that will improve the take-up and efficacy of commitment devices to mitigate inefficient behavior that arises from present bias. The results have applications in several areas, including savings, health, education, and training. Further, we see that informal commitment exists in developing countries where there may be barriers to implementing formal commitment devices. By isolating a relational mechanism that makes informal commitment effective, we can help implement feasible commitment devices in more diverse settings. <br/><br/>In the first experiment, I deviate from the current experimental literature and hypothesize that people have distributional beliefs about their present-bias instead of point-beliefs. I show that this uncertainty can explain why a person whose elicited point-belief of  suggests that he should commit but may rationally choose not to commit. Using a lab experiment, I attempt to establish that people have distributional beliefs about their self-control, elicit the shape of their distributional beliefs, and examine whether subjects? beliefs are consistent with their commitment take-up. What we deem missing commitment may actually be a reluctance to commit due to uncertain self-control. In the second experiment, I test whether uncertainty about costs prevents take-up of traditional, inflexible, commitment devices and whether adding state-dependent flexibility to commitment options encourages take-up. Further, I introduce a treatment in which I measure whether the value of a commitment device is higher if we introduce a relational component, a main element of informal commitment devices. I isolate and test a mechanism by which relational commitment may be effective. The intellectual merit of this proposal is that it contributes to the recent literature on missing commitment. Additionally, establishing that people have distributional beliefs about their self-control has important implications for how we calculate commitment value and more generally how we model present-biased decision problems. I extend the literature by introducing a more general and possibly more descriptive form of naivety by allowing for uncertain beliefs."

With time, however, bacteria colonize on the surface of the ultrafiltration membranes in a process known as biofouling.  Biofouling decreases the transport of purified water across the membrane, requires expensive and time consuming methods to remove the accumulated bacteria, and ultimately, increase the costs, energy consumption of the water purification process, and shortens the lifetime of the membrane.  Current strategies to prevent biofouling include use of designer materials that prevent fouling, either via use of new polymers or incorporation of biocides into the existing membrane material.   These existing strategies lead to materials that are either expensive, unstable, and/or have decreased performance relative to the precursor membrane.  The research will provide evidence that materials chemistry can immobilize a nanomaterial onto a porous antifouling polymer ultrafiltration membrane.  <br/><br/>This project explores synthesis of a novel membrane hierarchical structure, which utilizes a hydrophilic polymer to increase the flux of pure water across the membrane by confining the hydrophilic polymer layer to an ultrathin upper layer, without blocking pores.  Secondly, sacrificial antifouling strips with biocidal properties will be electronspun onto this layer to localize fouling and antimicrobial properties to certain regions of the membrane. In this one year project, the PI will demonstrate that the antifouling fibers will adhere to the ultrathin hydrophilic layer, to alleviate concerns of the high risk nature of the concept. The first method to be explore for deposition of the fibers is electrospinning, while contingency plans include additive manufacturing and 3D printing."

Scholarship support will be provided for 24 graduate students over the course of 5 years, with 7-8 students sponsored each year.  The program will focus on developing the skills necessary for working in regionally important industries including agriculture, biotechnology, food production, nutrition and healthcare.  Participants will gain a background in basic biochemistry, with opportunities to address problems in Plant Biology, Microbiology, Animal Science, and Food and Nutrition Sciences.  The program will focus on Master's level training, in recognition of fast-growing opportunities for employment and advancement for these students, and hopes to provide access to well-paying and meaningful jobs for African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans.  Individualized curricula will be formulated to fit the background and goals of each student, and a variety of support systems will be established.  These include team mentoring, where the student is both mentee and mentor, cohort building activities with other students in the program, cultural awareness training, and career and professional development activities.  Student success will be assessed in terms of progress through the program, effectiveness and efficiency of the curriculum support strategies, establishment of a sense of belonging within the program, and workforce placement after graduation.<br/><br/>The IBGP will expand the Biochemistry Master's program to include interdisciplinary training, preparing low-income students for further academic research or industry jobs at the nexus of food, agriculture and human health.  Currently recruitment of academically talented minority and low-income students to the Biochemistry Master's program is limited by: 1) insufficient outreach; 2) lack of financial support; 3) limited academic and social support for students of diverse backgrounds; and 4) limited career development for private sector as well as academic positions.  This project will systematically address these limitations. Students will be recruited through existing Graduate School and Departmental mechanisms, and outreach to North Carolina's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  A holistic review approach will be utilized in selecting students, including traditional performance indicators and other qualities such as motivation, leadership and self-appraisal.  Developing personal and professional networks are key to students' success.  Students will participate in mentoring teams within the cohort of IBGP students, with senior peer mentors, and with external mentors outside of the department. Enhanced academic support includes summer bridge classes prior to entering the program, added discussion groups associated with graduate classes, and individualized curriculum development.  Students will develop career plans to inform their academic and research choices, including possible industry internships, seminars and workshops.  The IBGP will foster interdisciplinary training between Biochemistry and associated departments to increase career opportunities for Master's students.  Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected for formative and summative assessments of student recruitment, student integration into the program, student progress through the program, and career development."

Some of these earthquakes generate large tsunamis.  Our ability to understand which earthquakes produce tsunamis is limited by the lack of information about how the seafloor is moving offshore. To address this, continuously recording bottom pressure recorders have been deployed over the subduction zone off the coast of Oregon to estimate long-term vertical deformation. Seafloor pressure measurements combine both seafloor movement and a contribution from the overlying ocean water column. Present efforts to estimate water-column contributions to the measurement use a regional oceanographic model.  This model, however, has difficulty estimating pressure variations from eddies and currents near the seafloor, which may be significant. During the project, special instruments will be placed near to the ocean bottom pressure recorders. These instruments will be able to measure the changing pressures from the overlying water column, allowing for a more accurate measure of the tectonic deformation that is occurring offshore. The project supports an early career faculty member from an under-represented group.<br/><br/>This project will quantify the water-column contributions to the signal from ocean bottom pressure recorders using in situ observations. Specifically, four Current and Pressure Recording Inverted Echo Sounder (CPIES) will be deployed offshore Oregon near existing ocean bottom pressure recorder benchmarks. CPIES are unique because they simultaneously measure bottom pressure, current, and round-trip acoustic travel time from the sea floor to the sea surface and back. By combining these measurements, the water signal can be separated from the measured bottom pressure signal. These measurements complement existing measurements and provide critical information to distinguish water column signal from tectonic signal for both long-term and transient signals. Methodology developed from previous physical oceanographic process studies will be applied and this effort will demonstrate the application for geophysical studies."

However, the connection between SES and mortality is often oversimplified, and, in extreme cases, could misinform health policy and treatment protocols about the risks faced by individuals in a variety of contexts. Biological anthropology is well-equipped to explore the variability of patterns of SES and heath in the past by interpreting the results of bioarchaeological research in light of current theoretical perspectives espoused by public health researchers investigating the connection between SES and health in living populations. This project provides a novel model for exploring SES in past societies and will broaden understanding of the effects of SES across time by focusing on a context that differs from the modern, industrialized populations to which these theoretical perspectives have been applied. As a result, this multidisciplinary project will advance research in biological anthropology and extend the temporal purview of public health research by incorporating intersectionality theory into a study of past health. Moreover, the work will train a female graduate student and contribute to public science outreach efforts in both the United States and the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>This dissertation project uses skeletal samples to examine the interactions of SES, demographic characteristics (such as age and sex), exposure to physiological stressors, and mortality in the context of industrialization in 19th century England. Skeletal data from four industrial-era cemeteries (Coach Lane, St. Bride's Fleet Street, St. Peter's Wolverhampton, and New Bunhill Fields) will be analyzed with paleodemographic approaches (hazard modeling, hierarchical log-linear analysis, and analysis of variance) to determine how morbidity and mortality patterns in industrial England differed between SES groups; investigate how physiological stressors throughout life interacted with socially meaningful categories such as age and sex to produce layered marginalizations that influenced frailty and mortality in industrial England; and evaluate the potential of stressors underrepresented in biological anthropology literature to enhance understanding of marginalization, intersectionality, and mortality in the past."

This project builds on the successful Portal to the Public (PoP) framework, bringing together the expertise and resources of HEIs and ISEs around the shared mission of engaging public audiences in current STEM research. The project is designed to address several critical needs: (1) Public outreach BI activities are relatively uncommon compared to BI that is focused within the infrastructure of academia; (2) Because collaborations with ISEs are frequently tied to individual Principal Investigators (PIs), there is limited opportunity to build a body of knowledge around the practice of partnering for BI work; and (3) Collaborations are often transient, making it more difficult for universities to view BI on an institutional level in ways that leverage particular institutional assets or strategies and even link investigators from multiple projects.<br/><br/>The specific areas of study are: <br/>a.  Develop and test a structure for education/outreach BI experience design that addresses a public audience need and meets NSF's BI criterion: The project will create disseminatable tools around the activity design process (including evaluation of learning impacts). By convening cross-disciplinary teams, the project will ensure that experiences will reflect a wide range of expertise and will help meet the needs of multiple stakeholders. These established structures will lower the barrier to entry for PIs who want to do public outreach BI.<br/><br/>b.  Design, test, and study structures for long-term, mutually beneficial HEI-ISE partnerships: The project will build on the proven PoP model to create flexible, disseminatable tools around the development of institutional partnerships at three collaborating HEI-ISE site pairings that consider each institution's resources, constraints and strategic goals, including a cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary Broader Impacts Design (BID) Team structure. Sustained partnerships will support ongoing public engagement with current STEM research.<br/><br/>c.  Anchor the partnership at the HEI with a representative from an office of research support: Research support professionals will be a core part of the BID Team and will help support institutional strategies for aligning BI activities with broader goals around community engagement.<br/><br/>d.

The emergence of new sign languages can provide insights into how human language evolves. To date, however, studies of the phenomenon are retrospective in nature beginning ten or more years after the deaf children were brought together. This means that we know little about how deaf children share their idiosyncratic gestures, known as 'homesign', to create a common sign language. In March 2016, 35 deaf children who currently communicate via homesign gestures were brought together for the first time in two all deaf classrooms in Iquitos, Peru. This project gathers data on the individual deaf children's gesture and their initial inter-personal communication using these gestures. The goal is to understand the very first stage of language emergence. The unique insight of this investigation is the gathering of data about the deaf children's gestures before they meet other deaf children and how their gestures change throughout their first year of interaction with one another. In reality, deaf children across the world frequently grow up without access to a shared language. The data gathered in the present study will provide the first documentation of how children's communicative interactions via gesture become codified into the initial symbols and symbolic utterances that form the basis of language. The study will also provide insights into how a low-tech and inexpensive means to facilitate sign language acquisition for isolated deaf children can be used to educate deaf children throughout Latin America and the developing world. <br/><br/>Researchers have long hypothesized that bringing together deaf children who have not had access to a conventional language in either speech or sign will result in the emergence of a new sign language from the deaf children's idiosyncratic gesture systems. One such well-known situation is the emergence of Nicaraguan Sign Language, NSL, which has been used to model language evolution (Senghas 2003; Senghas & Coppola 2001; Senghas et al 2004). Because research on NSL only began 10 years after deaf children of Managua were first brought together in a school, the available data and research on sign language emergence is purely retrospective in nature. The crucial, initial stages of sign language emergence have never before been observed or studied. Data essential to investigate the emergence of a new sign language in Iquitos, Peru will be gathered from individual children and groups of deaf children with respect to emerging lexical forms and utterance structure, or syntax. Spontaneous and elicited data have already been gathered from each child while communicating via gesture with his or her family prior to school enrollment. The individual child data will continue to be gathered on a yearly basis. At the group level, the deaf children's spontaneous communication with each other will be videotaped in the classrooms at regular intervals throughout their first year together. This data, at both the child and group level, will be gathered (1) prior to, (2) during, and (3) after one year's time of the children's initial contact. The data with will yield unique observations about when and how a sign language emerges from children's idiosyncratic gesture systems. Although research suggests that sign languages emerge quickly in school settings when deaf children are brought together for the first time, the contribution of each child's gesture system to the initial organization of the group's emerging sign language is currently unknown. With the opportunity to document language emergence from inception, the proposed study will fill this theoretical gap by mapping the relation of each child's pre-existing gestural system and ability onto his or her subsequent learning of others' gestures and signs."

This proposal aims to improve our understanding of the relationship between the structure of a network and the performance of networked dynamical processes, such as the spread of diseases in human contact networks, the propagation of information in online social networks, and coordination protocols in robotic networks. From an engineering perspective, a central focus of this work will be the development of efficient strategies to design secure and efficient critical networked infrastructures. In particular, those factors that make a network efficient and/or resilient with respect to a particular dynamical process will be explored. For example, the following questions will be studied: What structural factors make a communication network efficient in the coordination of a group of robotic agents? What network properties are useful while containing the spread of a disease in a human contact network? Since networks are ubiquitous across science and engineering, developing efficient tools for network analysis and design is of great relevance to many scientific disciplines. The proposed research program will be complemented with a comprehensive educational agenda spanning K-12, undergraduate, and graduate level education at the University of Pennsylvania. At the level of K-12 education, the PI will teach a three-week intense course about Engineering Complex Networks to encourage high-school students to further pursue an education in STEM-related fields. This project would also support and train doctorate students in the field of complex networks; as well as undergraduate students working on short-term projects, with an emphasis on increasing retention rates of under-represented minorities in engineering.<br/><br/>During the last decade, Network Science has matured into an established research field, providing a plethora of tools for modeling and analyzing complex systems. In particular, the field of spectral graph theory has been instrumental in the development of a wide array of powerful network analysis techniques, such as spectral graph partitioning, community detection, and ranking techniques (including Google PageRank). Furthermore, spectral-graph properties are directly related to the dynamical behavior of many networked processes, such as synchronization of oscillators, multi-agent coordination, and viral spreading processes. The goal of this project is to develop a novel computational framework based on recent results from algebraic graph theory and real algebraic geometry to infer global spectral properties of dynamical relevance from local structural information. Theoretical advancements in this proposal will go hand-in-hand with the development of scalable algorithms for spectral analysis of massive networked systems.  Furthermore, an important part of this proposal will be focused on developing efficient strategies to design secure and efficient networked dynamical systems. Examples of particular design problems that will be considered are the design of efficient topologies to facilitate in-network coordination in multi-agent robotic systems, as well as the design of network interventions to contain viral processes in human contact networks. During the course of this proposal, the PI will address a number of fundamental open theoretical problems, as well as explore the application of newly developed techniques to a diverse array of network control problems in collaborations with domain-specific experts."

Protein-water interactions thus play a crucial role in protein hydration, its stability, as well as its interactions with ligands and other proteins. However, characterizing protein-water interactions is challenging, because they depend not only on the chemistry, but also on the precise topography and the chemical pattern presented by the protein surface. As a result, a fundamental understanding of how water structure is perturbed at protein interfaces, and how this perturbation in turn affects protein interactions, is lacking.  The goal of this proposal is to characterize and understand the interactions between protein surfaces and their hydration waters, and to introduce students ranging from elementary to graduate school, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to aspects of protein hydration and interactions through the use of innovative teaching methods and materials. The results from this project will be broadly disseminated to the research community and the general public.<br/><br/>To enable a comprehensive characterization of protein-water interactions, the PI will employ novel simulation techniques to apply an unfavorable biasing potential to water molecules in the entire protein hydration shell. As the strength of the potential is increased, protein-water interactions are systematically disrupted, and the response of the hydration shell waters to the applied potential contains a wealth of information that can be analyzed to: (1) identify regions of the protein that have the weakest interactions with water, and investigate whether they can serve as predictors of protein interaction interfaces, (2) estimate free energies for hydrating diverse ligand-shaped cavities in the protein hydration shell, which inform protein-ligand interactions, and (3) identify super-hydrophilic patches on the protein that allow them to have strong interactions with water, and interrogate whether such interactions are able to stabilize the protein upon dehydration. The proposed research promises to break new ground by providing molecular level understanding and uncovering its impact on protein interactions and assembly. As novel protein structures continue to be solved at an incredible rate, modulating protein interactions promises to be an exciting frontier in the search for novel therapeutics."

The goal of this work is to obtain and analyze surfaces which are capable of redirecting light rays emanating from a point source located in one of the media into a set of directions or onto a specific target located in the other media, in such a way that the input and output intensities of the rays are prespecified. The application of the laws of geometric optics and conservation of energy principles to formulate the mathematical model will naturally lead to second order nonlinear partial differential equations of Monge - Ampre type. The determination of the surfaces will incite problems of existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations and mass transport problems. The specific objectives of this project include: developing a computational algorithm for the near field refractor problem in isotropic media, formulating mathematical models of geometrical optics problems in anisotropic media such as crystals, finding numerical and analytical solutions for near field and far field refractor problems in anisotropic media and investigating the regularity of analytical solutions for near field and far field refractor problems in anisotropic media. The consideration of anisotropic media will advance the mathematical theory of geometric optics problems to media of propagation that are more general and will make it more amenable to several optics applications including optical devices, design of freeform refractive beam shapers and laser optics."

In certain areas of the ocean where iron is scarce, it can limit biological growth even though other essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus are abundant.  Consequently, to fully understand and quantify biological productivity in the ocean, a complete knowledge of all sources and sinks for iron is essential. The researchers funded for this project have already generated exciting preliminary data that suggest a potentially large, yet, unquantified pathway for iron removal. Diatoms, phytoplankton with shells made of silica, are shown to incorporate traces of iron into their shells, making it unavailable for rapid recycling or use by marine organisms in surface waters. Given the great abundance of diatoms in many parts of the ocean, this could represent a major, unstudied removal mechanism that regulates the concentration of iron in seawater. This research could transform current understanding of how iron is removed from the ocean, and it will impact understanding of both the chemical and biological processes involving iron in seawater. The investigator also plans outreach in K-12 schools by providing educational courses for Earth Science teachers and will support graduate student training in advanced chemical analysis and oceanography. <br/><br/>High-resolution synchrotron-based chemical techniques will allow determination of the concentration and oxidation state of iron bound within diatom frustules. This analytical advance has created the ability for unique evaluation of iron sequestration into biogenic silica as a major pathway for iron removal from the ocean. Samples from the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have been collected in a previous CLIVAR field campaign and a subset of these are available for new synchrotron analysis of iron (Fe) with Near Edge X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Fe-NEXFS) and submicron scale X-ray fluorescence mapping, as well as a variety of other chemical characterizations. With these methods, the project will determine the importance of iron sequestered into biogenic silica as a new and unquantified loss term in the oceanic Fe cycle and examine the changing chemical complexes of iron during vertical transport of silica particles through the water column."

The proposed Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) addresses the RH6: Human Assistive Technologies area.  QPAS will be lightweight, have a long battery life, and optimize the passive dynamics of amputee gait in unconstrained environments by using battery energy to tune its physical system properties, ankle equilibrium angle and torsional stiffness.  The device provides a unique set of features that do not currently exist in the market, strengthening its value proposition.  The amputee population is growing; 2,000 new lower limb amputation are performed each week.  Therefore, QPAS will have strong market potential and the significant societal impact of improving health by supporting a more active lifestyle for lower limb amputees.  This will also lead to more community and family involvement.  Additionally, because of the many possibilities to control QPAS, gait researchers will be able to study amputee compensation preferences.  A better understanding of the kinematic and kinetic preferences could lead to improvements in the design of purely passive ankle prostheses.  <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the needs of lower limb amputees. Lower limb amputees suffer from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with increased risk of falling.  Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground walking at one speed.  QPAS will utilize a patented compliant actuator to achieve a unique set of features: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint, adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range of ankle motion, adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence level ground and slope gait, and controlled energy delivery to ensure energy builds naturally and smoothly.  In this phase 2 SBIR, an intuitive and autonomous controller will be built for the QPAS and human subject evaluations will assist in refining the device towards commercialization. QPAS will become a successful product by focusing on improved amputee gait performance in unconstrained environments, and being simple to fit and adjust, reliable and affordable."

Originally it was thought the loss of wolves would lead to a dramatic increase in the number of elk, which in turn would lead to substantial changes in the willows along the park's streams. It was expected that reintroduction of wolves would cause a rapid restoration of willow communities due declines in elk numbers. However, the first fifteen years of research indicates that the fate of the willow communities is complex, involving interactions among wolves, elk, bison, beavers and available water. This research will focus on how these complex interactions among predators, grazing animals, and local hydrology influence plants on landscapes.  This knowledge forms the scientific foundation for managing rangelands throughout the western United States, and in so doing, enhances human economies throughout the region. The unfolding story of wolves in Yellowstone is of great public interest and will be communicated in the popular media. The researchers will collaborate with park staff in Yellowstone to offer citizen education to four million visitors annually. Data and conclusions will be made easily available to the public, to natural resource managers, and to researchers throughout the United States.  <br/><br/>The extirpation of wolves from Yellowstone National Park at the turn of the century allowed elk populations to increase to levels that degraded vegetation along small streams. Historically abundant willows were eliminated and dam building by beaver ceased. The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 caused a dramatic decline in the number of elk grazing on the park?s northern range, creating an unusual opportunity to understand how herbivores influence plant communities. It has been hypothesized that effects of wolves on elk caused a rapid restoration of riparian communities by reducing browsing on willows. The research team has conducted a 15-year, manipulative experiment to test this hypothesis and to understand the roles of herbivory and water availability in controlling willow growth. The experiment found little support for the idea that wolves changed the ecosystem by releasing plants from consumption by elk. Instead, availability of water controlled willow response. The experiment showed that the absence of effects of effects of reduced elk numbers on willows on the northern range is explained by the absence of dam building by beaver, an activity that enhances availability of water for willows. Beavers, in turn, need willows for food and dam building materials. Patchy recovery of willows has allowed beaver to return recently to a few small streams. Dams built on these streams, in turn, may accelerate the recovery of willows. Alternatively, consumption of willows by increasingly abundant bison populations may compete with beavers and prevent them from maintaining dams, preventing widespread willow recovery. Researchers will continue their experiment on willow growth, supplementing it with observations on effects of natural beaver dams on willows to understand how effects of wolves, elk, bison, and beavers act to determine the state of the riparian ecosystem. State-of-the-art statistical models will be used to analyze data. Results will have important implications for understanding and managing riparian zones embedded within semi-arid grassland landscapes worldwide."

The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, which is accompanied by excessive absorption of sunlight by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity.  The deficiency in simulated cloud cover is most pronounced in boundary layer and lower-tropospheric clouds (tops below 3km) in the cold, dry sectors of frontal weather systems traveling along the SO storm track.<br/><br/>The work funded under this award is part of a larger field campaign titled Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The primary activity of the campaign is the deployment of a Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The GV will be based in Hobart, Australia and make multiple flights across the South Polar front collecting data on SO clouds and the meteorological conditions in which they occur. The GV is equipped with dropsondes to record ambient meteorological conditions, radar and lidar to observe the clouds, and instruments mounted on the wings or positioned behind inlets to to sample, collect and analyze aerosols and cloud particles (liquid droplets and ice crystals). The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South.<br/><br/>A key issue to be addressed in the campaign is the relative abundance of supercooled liquid water (SLW) droplets and ice particles in SO clouds, as SLW is more prevalent in SO clouds than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The PIs hypothesize that the extent to which SLW cloud droplets freeze into ice particles is more strongly modulated in SO clouds by the vigor of cloud updrafts than by the availability of Ice nucleating particles (INPs, particles within liquid droplets which trigger freezing). The PIs also seek to determine the relative influence of overlying free tropospheric aerosol concentrations versus local surface and boundary layer controls, including precipitation and wind speed, in determining the concentration of liquid droplets in boundary layer clouds.<br/><br/>Work funded under this award contributes to SOCRATES by measuring aerosol and cloud hydrometeor properties, specifically addressing three questions (from the proposal summary):<br/><br/>1) What are the chemical and physical properties of sub-micron and coarse-mode aerosol particles in the region, and how do they relate to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN, particles around which cloud droplets form), INP, and cloud properties?<br/><br/>2) What fraction of SO condensed water remains supercooled as a function of temperature, and can this be related to a dearth of INPs?<br/><br/>3) What is the role of biological aerosol particles in cloud formation over the SO?<br/><br/>These questions are addressed through in-situ air sampling using inlets available on the GV.  Sampling of cloudy air uses a specialized inlet known as a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI), which separates cloud droplets and ice crystals from smaller aerosol particles and other non-cloud material. Droplets and ice crystals are heated in the CVI to evaporate their water substance and the resulting vapor is measured with a laser hygrometer to determine total condensed water content.  Once the water is evaporated the droplets and ice are reduced to their nucleating particles (referred to as residual particles), which are counted and sized using an aerosol spectrometer.  A fluorescence-based spectrometer is used to separately count and size biological particles so that their role in nucleation can be assessed.  Residual particles are collected on slides for laboratory analysis using electron and X-ray microscopy that can determine morphology, composition, and mixing state. A key question in the analysis is the hygroscopicity of the particles, meaning their ability to absorb water vapor and thus serve as CCN. Additional measurements from wing-mounted supercooled liquid probes are used to estimate the ratio of SLW to ice content in the clouds.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potentially significant role of SO clouds in determining the sensitivity of global climate to external forcing from greenhouse gas increases and other factors. Data from the campaign will be used to develop better representations of clouds in models used for weather prediction and climate impacts assessments. The data will be made available to the worldwide scientific community, thus the campaign has broader impacts by creating a community resource for basic science research.  A further contribution to basic research is the development of a clean-in-place system for the CVI inlet, which will improve the reliability of the CVI for future users, particular in salty marine environments.  Campaign outreach to K-12 students and the general public is conducted through regular newsletters and blogs, and an interactive ""Ask SOCRATES"" website. Events in which campaign videos, microscope images of cloud particles, and aerosol samples collected during the campaign are presented to the general public, are also planned.  This award provides support and training to a graduate student and funds the participation of a second student in the campaign, thereby contribution to the development of the future workforce in this research area."

Societal Issues: We increasingly rely on the Internet but are unsure we can trust its security, privacy or resilience. <br/><br/>3.	Innovation Issues: Substantial barriers exist to at-scale experimentation with new architectures, services, and technologies. <br/><br/>GENI addresses these issues via scale (from federation) and support for two kinds of experiments: 1) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks; and 2) in-the-wild trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today's Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants. The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who among their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an instrument for research.

Identification of highly active metal sites on reducible oxide supports will enable design of catalysts with optimized composition and site location.  The catalyst structure-function relationships thus obtained will provide design guidance for converting a broad range of oxygenated organic compounds to high-value fuels and chemicals.  The research will be integrated with educational and outreach programs targeting American Indian students, while also emphasizing the importance of safety in chemical processes.<br/><br/>Biomass conversion processes typically create a broad range of oxygenated intermediates that are treated further by catalytic processes to remove the excess oxygen and build longer chain hydrocarbons attractive as fuel components and chemical intermediates.  Efficient conversion requires multifunctional catalysts - typically composed of metal and metal oxide active sites - capable of several simultaneous or sequential reaction steps.  While it is well understood that different types of active sites are required for the different reactions, the exact nature of those sites and their ideal proximity is not known.  This study will examine those factors by decoupling metal sites from reducible metal oxide sites using carbon nanotube (CNT) bridges as hydrogen shuttles.  By eliminating direct contact between the metal and metal oxide components, and by varying the metal-metal oxide spacing along the CNTs, the study will provide an opportunity to examine independently two important aspects of bifunctional catalysis on reducible metal oxides: metal-support interactions and hydrogen spillover from the metal to the metal oxide support.  The study will also investigate how the metal-support and hydrogen spillover effects vary with different types of molecules common to biomass deconstruction processes.  More broadly, the study will provide catalyst design guidance that can be used to improve the technoeconomic viability of a broad range of chemical reactions including those of importance in natural gas processing.  The PI is a faculty mentor for the American Indian Science and Engineering Society at the University of Oklahoma, and plans to use the  project as an opportunity to expand his on-going efforts to recruit Native American students at all levels via outreach camps that emphasize the importance of sustainable energy while generating excitement towards engineering degrees amongst American Indian and other underrepresented groups."

River plumes are vital components of the coastal circulation and biogeochemical cycles, serving as essential conduits to the coastal ocean for terrigenous carbon, nutrients, and other terrestrial constituents. Numerous theoretical, laboratory, and numerical studies point out the importance of the depth and width of the estuary mouth in setting bulk plume properties such as the cross-shore plume extent and coastal current transport. Additionally, the initial plume structure and subsequent response to external forcing (winds, waves, ambient shelf circulation) is largely set by the outflow. Since the late 1880's, the Lower Columbia River Estuary (LCRE) has experienced continual engineering modifications and the construction of jetties and the dredging of navigation channels at the mouth of the Columbia River that have altered both outlet depth and width by nearly 50%. The historical and modern LCRE/Columbia River Plume (CRP) systems provide a unique and novel testbed for examining the fundamental physical processes governing the coupling between the estuary, plume and coastal ocean while providing valuable insight and improve the collective understanding of the human impacts on the LCRE/CRP system. The project addresses how human-imposed changes to the river flow, geometry, morphology, and channel orientation of the LCRE over the last 130 years have impacted, or altered, the dominant physical processes that control the mixing, structure, and transports over the entire coupled river-estuary-coastal ocean system. Because plumes are a primary link in the land/ocean exchange of sediments, nutrients, and other scalars, a better understanding of historical changes to plume dynamics will broaden our understanding of long-term change to coastal ecosystems. The position and structure of the CRP additionally has important implications for reproductive strategies for the Columbia River salmon populations. The results of the project will be disseminated to local and regional stakeholders and managers at the Columbia River Estuary Conference where PIs will work to develop beneficial interdisciplinary collaborations. The proposal supports two early-career scientists and graduate student.<br/><br/>The main hypothesis of the project is that basic plume characteristics - hydraulic control at the outlet, mid-field plume size, stratification, plume entrainment rates, and interaction with upwelling winds - have been fundamentally altered. The existing historical and modern numerical models of the Lower Columbia River Estuary, which have been developed and calibrated using 19th and 21st century bathymetry and tide data, will be used. Sensitivity studies will alter forcing parameters such as river flow, tides, and wind thru their historical range, and results will be analyzed using non-dimensional numbers and thru conservation of mass/momentum/energy approaches. Because nearly all major river outlets in the US (and the world) have been modified, the proposed case-study will form a template for understanding changes in other locations; specifically, since the Columbia River system straddles a large parameter space in terms of tidal amplitudes and river flow, the proposed research will cover the boundary conditions (stratified and partially stratified conditions; currents; geometry) found at other major river outlets. Moreover, the historical changes have been so large that they will allow clear contrasts (historic vs. modern) to emerge. Arguably, the Columbia River Plume is the best location in the U.S. for such a study. The effects of anthropogenic changes are also important in the context of climate change: historical changes to river flow and depth provide a template for understanding future changes due to sea-level rise and altered hydrological patterns. The proposed research will be a critical step in advancing the knowledge of the human-induced impacts on the Oregon/Washington coast while simultaneously addressing fundamental questions on the role of outflow controls on plume structure and transports as it spreads and evolves on the continental shelf."

One way to understand the composition and nature of the Earth's mantle is by studying the chemistry of basalts, which originate by volcanic eruptions of partially melting mantle rocks.  This study will establish the budget and distribution of volatile elements (hydrogen, carbon, fluorine, chlorine, sulfur) in volcanic basalts to better understand the composition of the Earth's interior.  Volatiles influence mantle melting, magma crystallization, magma migration and volcanic eruptions.  Their abundances and spatial distribution provide important constraints on models of mantle flow and temperature. Moreover, volatiles are key constituents of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.  Establishing the cycles of volatiles between the Earth's interior and surface is of fundamental importance to understand the long-term evolution of our planet.  This project supports a graduate student and research scientist at Brown University. It promotes the collaboration with geochemists from eleven institutions representing six different countries: USA, Germany, United Kingdom, Argentina, South Korea and Japan, and utilizes several NSF-funded USA analytical facilities.  Communication of results will occur through: 1) peer-reviewed journals, presentations at conferences and invited university lectures, 2) hands-on science learning activities for local elementary and high school classes, and 3) outreach to the general audience through public lectures.<br/><br/>Over the last 60 years of funded research, the Antarctic Peninsula and nearby ocean ridges have been extensively investigated providing information on the origin of the magmatism, and the composition, structure, temperature and evolution of the lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle. Diverse hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the magmatism in the Antarctic Peninsula, from flux melting of the mantle wedge during devolatilization of the subducted Phoenix plate, to adiabatic decompression melting of a carbonated and hydrous asthenosphere, to melting of a volatile-rich metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle. All proposed hypotheses invoke the role of volatiles. Surprisingly, data on the volatile contents of basalts and mantle from this region are non-existent. This is a significant omission from the geochemical data set, given the important role volatile elements play in the generation and composition of magmas and their sources. The focus of our research is to examine the regional variations in volatile contents (C, H, F, S, Cl) in geochemically well-characterized Pliocene-recent basalts from the Antarctic Peninsula and Phoenix ridge. Our goal is to establish the budget and distribution of volatiles in the mantle to understand 1) the processes responsible for the generation of chemically diverse basalts in close spatial and temporal proximity and 2) the nature (lithology, composition and temperature) of the heterogeneous mantle source beneath the Antarctic Peninsula and Phoenix ridge."

Protein biomarkers circulating in human body fluids have a great potential to be used in the clinic to indicate diseases. To date, the poor sensitivity and high cost are still the key challenges prohibiting a practical point-of-care diagnostic test based on quantifying low-abundance disease biomarkers. In this project, the investigator aims to establish a low-cost, high sensitivity, multiplexed, rapid, and automated paradigm based upon a hybrid sensor in conjunction with a new readout modality that can perform biomarker analysis for disease diagnostics. The project focuses on investigating the paper-based nanophotonics that integrates photonic crystal devices and paper-based microfluidics, and on how to exploit the unique optical phenomena enabled by the photonic crystal for the biomarker detection with high sensitivity and specificity. In particular, the inexpensive integration of nanophotonic devices with paper substrates that can filter and transport body fluid samples is being addressed. The low-cost and disposable feature of the sensor is highly desirable in resource-limited settings, such as bedside test, remote military deployment, and developing countries. In addition, the sensor is ready to be modified for the detection of pathogenic species that causes server diseases, such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, and HIV. The project also includes education and outreach activities to foster undergraduate students' passion for research, engage underrepresented minority students, and bring science and technology to K-12 schools and agriculture communities in the Midwest.<br/><br/>Rapid and accurate diagnostics is fundamental to healthcare, regardless of whether it is used for an individual patient with a disease, such as cancer, or for a worldwide epidemic. The research goal of this project is to establish a low-cost, high sensitivity, multiplexed, rapid, and automated biosensor based upon a hybrid device and a new readout modality that can perform biomarker analysis for clinical diagnostics. The transformative aspect of this project is to provide fundamental insights and evidence into the paper-photonic crystal hybrid system, which would enable the invention of new disposable. The novelty of the proposed works lies in two facts: i) the integration of photonic crystal and paper as a flow-through sensor platform and ii) the application of a photoacoustics-based readout scheme. In particular, the project will be carried out by combining numerical models and experiments according to the following three specific research objectives: i) integration of photonic crystal and paper-based microfluidics, ii) establishment of photonic crystal-enhanced photoacoustic detection for paper-based biosensor, and iii) multiplexed detection for in-vitro disease diagnostics. The project outcome will fill a significant gap between optofluidics and point-of-care tests by addressing challenging questions including: What are the fluid transport phenomena in a photonic crystal-paper hybrid system? How can photonic crystal structure enable ultrahigh sensitivity in paper-based biosensors? How can the photoacoustic detection improve the detection sensitivity and eliminate background noises from paper substrates?"

The on-shore oil and gas pipeline transmission industry has pressing needs for non-destructive tests because of the aging infrastructure, national need for energy, and recent explosions and leaks that have cost lives and billions in remediation. Although transmission pipelines have low failure rate per mile of assets, pipeline operators are asked to proactively enhance pipeline integrity where they do not have all the necessary strength data.

The project is designed to address several critical needs: (1) Public outreach BI activities are relatively uncommon compared to BI that is focused within the infrastructure of academia; (2) Because collaborations with ISEs are frequently tied to individual Principal Investigators (PIs), there is limited opportunity to build a body of knowledge around the practice of partnering for BI work; and (3) Collaborations are often transient, making it more difficult for universities to view BI on an institutional level in ways that leverage particular institutional assets or strategies and even link investigators from multiple projects.<br/><br/>The specific areas of study are: <br/>a.  Develop and test a structure for education/outreach BI experience design that addresses a public audience need and meets NSF's BI criterion: The project will create disseminatable tools around the activity design process (including evaluation of learning impacts). By convening cross-disciplinary teams, the project will ensure that experiences will reflect a wide range of expertise and will help meet the needs of multiple stakeholders.

The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, which is accompanied by excessive absorption of sunlight by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity.  The deficiency in simulated cloud cover is most pronounced in boundary layer and lower-tropospheric clouds (tops below 3km) in the cold, dry sectors of frontal weather systems traveling along the SO storm track.<br/><br/>The work funded under this award is part of a larger field campaign titled Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The primary activity of the campaign is the deployment of a Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The GV will be based in Hobart, Australia and make multiple flights across the South Polar front collecting data on SO clouds and the meteorological conditions in which they occur. The GV is equipped with dropsondes to record ambient meteorological conditions, radar and lidar to observe the clouds, and instruments mounted on the wings or positioned behind inlets to to sample, collect and analyze aerosols and cloud particles (liquid droplets and ice crystals). The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South.<br/><br/>A key issue to be addressed in the campaign is the relative abundance of supercooled liquid water (SLW) droplets and ice particles in SO clouds, as SLW is more prevalent in SO clouds than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The PIs hypothesize that the extent to which SLW cloud droplets freeze into ice particles is more strongly modulated in SO clouds by the vigor of cloud updrafts than by the availability of Ice nucleating particles (INPs, particles within liquid droplets which trigger freezing). The PIs also seek to determine the relative influence of overlying free tropospheric aerosol concentrations versus local surface and boundary layer controls, including precipitation and wind speed, in determining the concentration of liquid droplets in boundary layer clouds.<br/><br/>Work under this award seeks to determine the abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), aerosol particles which absorb water vapor from the air to form liquid water droplets that are collectively visible as clouds.  CCN abundances are assessed using two miniature CCN counters, or mCCNs, each weighing 1.5kg.  The mCCNs are diffusion chambers in which aerosols collected in clear air (meaning outside of clouds) are subjected to humidity values above the saturation level so that those which are able to serve as CCN at a given temperature and supersaturation form droplets which can be counted. One mCCN is operated at a constant supersaturation value which is representative of the mean supersaturation level in local clouds as determined by other instruments on the aircraft.  The mCCN has a 1Hz sampling rate so that it can be used to produce high-resolution CCN concentration profiles as the GV ascends and descends through the boundary layer, cloud layer, and free troposphere.  The other mCCN is operated at supersaturation levels which are adjusted over the range of supersaturation values expected in SO clouds, so that a full CCN spectrum (CCN concentration as a function of supersaturation) can be recorded over five minute sampling intervals during level flight.<br/><br/>Three hypotheses are addressed with the measurements, along with other campaign data:<br/><br/>1) Anthropogenic aerosols are transported over the SO in the free troposphere and mixed downward into the boundary layer during the passage of frontal weather systems. The balance between the injection of aerosols by downward mixing and their removal by rain events establishes a north-south gradient in aerosol and CCN concentration across the South Polar front.<br/><br/>2) Sea spray and continental transport determine aerosol and CCN properties over the SO, while the seasonal cycle of biological activity plays a larger role in aerosol-cloud interactions in the Antarctic coastal regions (south of 56 degrees);<br/><br/>3) Relatively small changes in CCN concentration over the SO has a profound impact on cloud microphysical properties as the sensitivity of cloud microphysical properties is high at these low aerosol concentrations.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potentially significant role of SO clouds in determining the sensitivity of global climate to external forcing from greenhouse gas increases and other factors. Data from the campaign will be used to develop better representations of clouds in models used for weather prediction and climate impacts assessments. The data will be made available to the worldwide scientific community, thus the campaign has broader impacts by creating a community resource for basic science research. This project has educational benefits for undergraduate interns from the NSF-funded Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) center and a students from a local charter school, who will assist with calibration and operation of the instrumentation and data analysis.  In addition, the project support and trains a postdoc, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

The power grid's increasing dependence on information systems and technologies however challenges its capability to become aware of and accordingly recover from unexpected incidents.  This is because the traditional situational awareness paradigm in grid operations has so far limited to events and contingencies at the physical grid layer. A vivid example of this limitation is the recent cyber-attacks to the Ukrainian power grid, where cyber intrusions invisible to grid operators caused unauthorized tripping of circuit breakers and thereby wide-area blackouts. To address this status quo, the objective of this CAREER project is to equip grid operators with better tools to monitor the underlying cyber-states, particularly focusing on the operational quality and security of the cyber layer. Its successful completion will transform the grid operational paradigm by providing integrated situational awareness capabilities of both cyber and physical assets, towards more efficient, secure, and resilient power gird infrastructures.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to develop a suite of improved situational awareness tools that can seamlessly bridge the cyber-physical layers of today's electricity delivery infrastructures. At the bulk transmission level, we propose to revitalize the design of traditional energy control center systems, in particular the topology processing and security analysis modules, to jointly infer the cyber-physical operating states and to efficiently evaluate the security impacts of potential cyber-physical contingencies. As for small-footprint microgrids, we propose to investigate the flexibility and vulnerability trade-offs between centralized and distributed architectures in the presence of cyber-intrusions to communication links. Our research plan consists of three cohesive thrusts: T1) Optimal topology inference and cyber state estimation using a multitude of cyber-physical data; T2) Real-time cyber-physical dynamic security assessment by developing the 'cyber-contingency distribution factors' and model-free stability analysis methods; and T3) Distributed microgrid operations under cyber-physical disturbances and countermeasure designs. This CAREER development plan will also integrate an education plan with  the research goals by i) developing a learning platform with cyber-physical grid visualization that is appropriate for pre-college students, ii) introducing course projects and special topics on the cyber aspects to college-level power engineering curricula, and iii) promoting undergraduate research experience especially for female and under-represented engineering students."

While meeting this goal, AGNES has become an important center for algebraic geometry in the US. The conference has an extensive record of promoting collaboration and has developed new tools for training and mentoring future leaders in algebraic geometry. These consist of graduate mini-schools, career panels, poster presentations for junior participants (including undergraduate students), and events specifically targeting members of groups that are under-represented in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a sub-field of mathematical sciences that studies solution sets of polynomial equations. It has deep connections to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as topology, arithmetic, number theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and homological algebra. At the same time algebraic geometry has found important applications in applied mathematics and computer science (computer vision, geometric complexity theory, numerical methods in algebraic statistics, etc). The centerpiece research activity of each AGNES meeting will be 7-8 invited lectures given by speakers showcasing different facets of algebraic geometry. The scientific scope of AGNES will be further expanded by lectures from neighboring mathematical subjects (such as arithmetic geometry, dynamics, complex geometry, and computational geometry) and by the various supporting activities described above.

Increasingly, data such as sleep duration and physical activity can be inferred through fitness trackers and smartphone sensors, but personal experiences such as symptom tracking, pain, and sleep quality still need to be tracked manually.  This is effortful, especially for teenagers with immature self-care abilities.  Thus, one key aim of the project is to design collaborative strategies for collecting self-report data that vary the timing, method, and person used to collect the data to maximize the quality and consistency of data collected for particular teens, given their condition, self-care abilities, and family situation.  A second key aim is to align this self-report data with data sensed by smartphones and fitness trackers, developing algorithms and visual displays that help teens and families review the data together and make good decisions about the teens' condition.  For both data collection and review, the tools developed will need to be sensitive to problems such as differences in parents' and teens' views of the condition and teens' needs to become independent and establish personal identity.  To do this, the research team will work very closely with families with chronically-ill teens, doing field studies of how families currently manage this sort of tracking, interviews with teens and parents both together and separately, and short-term studies with prototype tools as they build and improve them.  The project will end with a long-term evaluation of the tools to see how they affect teens' attitudes and abilities related to self-care, as well as how they work with their families and doctors.  The work will inform the lead investigator's courses on human-computer interaction and personal health informatics, and support the development of summer camp outreach activities to K-12 students, using health informatics to increase their interest in STEM research.<br/><br/>The research work will proceed in three main phases, working closely with adolescent patients and doctors at multiple medical centers in the Atlanta area.  The first phase involves formative work around the first aim of eliciting personal health care information and defining requirements for mobile sensing applications that embody collaborative data collection, presentation, and management techniques.  This will involve interview studies with teens, parents, and caregivers, to elicit their attitudes toward and perceptions of collaborative personal health management technologies. It will also utilize pilot deployments of strategies for collecting data through ecological momentary assessments and experience sampling, with frequency and timing guided in part by automatically-sensed data.  The second phase aims at building a fully functional prototype system, with three main components: (1) implementation of data collection strategies proven effective in the first phase; (2) development of augmented data fusion techniques that triangulate self-reported with sensed data; and (3) creation of both algorithms for analyzing the fused data and visualizations that support these analyses.  This prototype will then drive the third phase, an 18-month study with 60 families in three groups: one that will use the full prototype, one a version that replaces the collaborative elicitation strategies with an existing, standard sampling strategy, and one as a control group.  The analysis will examine how the system affects both adolescents' and parents' privacy concerns, acceptance of both self-reported and sensed mobile data collection in general and with this tool in particular, the effort required to use the tool, and adolescents' self-efficacy and health locus of control. The evaluation will utilize both standard survey instruments for quantitative measures and interviews with adolescents as they use the tools over time."

As the footprint of the basic circuits on a microchip is shrinking to nanometers in size, close proximity of these components can cause an information ""traffic jam"" due to the interactions between electrons. In order to overcome this limitation, current research efforts are exploring the idea of replacing electrons with photons as the principal carriers of information since they do not interact directly with each other. A photonic device is expected to be superior in terms of speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency. However, this lack of direct interaction can be a double-edged sword: how can a photon be controlled by another photon in an all-optical device? To answer this conundrum, this proposed project will exploit the electromagnetic confinement and enhancement power of metallic nanostructures to not only guide photons on a nanoscale footprint below their diffraction limit, but to also control, on the timescale of trillionths of a second, how photons are emitted from a nanoscale light source called the quantum dot and where they will go. The key idea is not to rely on the direct photon interaction but rather to use the optically excited metallic nanostructures to strongly modify the quantum dot, which subsequently determines the properties and directions of the produced photon. The successful implementation of these techniques lays the path to ultrafast optical switches or transistors that can lead to a paradigm shift in information processing technology.<br/><br/>Technical description: This five-year career-development plan is a comprehensive research, education, and outreach program. The research plan aims to develop new ways of controlling the light-matter interactions on the nanoscale in a hybrid system of quantum dots and plasmonic structures. The objectives of the proposed research project are two folds. The first explores a new approach for manipulating and tuning the internal energy states of a single quantum dot through the optical modification of its local dielectric environment using a plasmonic gate. This indirect method exploits the strong near-field effect of the plasmonic structure as a mean of control while avoiding significant changes to the intrinsic properties of the quantum dot due to ohmic loss. The second investigates the coherent and incoherent couplings between two spatially separated quantum dots via a plasmonic waveguide and establish entanglement between the linked dots through a dissipative coupling channel. This coupled design protects stored information in the presence of ohmic loss while maintaining the ultrafast optical readout and broadband guided transfer enabled by a plasmonic waveguide. All of these capabilities are highly desirable in a wide range of applications from ultrafast optical switches to quantum information processing. The educational plan outlines a deep commitment to improve STEM education at the K-12 and university levels. The objectives of the proposed educational plan aim to develop an integrated approach that combines academic learning with extracurricular guidance to help students gain the scientific, analytical, and stress management skills necessary in becoming an independent scientist. This approach is carried out through the revitalization of the local Society of Physics Student chapter. In addition, outreach activities are structured to promote the field of nanotechnology and optics to young women in K-12 schools through visual and interactive presentations and engage middle and high school girls in STEM. Lastly, a new graduate quantum optics course is developed to address the knowledge gap in the current physics curriculum."

Existing software systems based on traditional pull-based database engine design and CPU hardware often do not provide the desired high throughput and/or short response time in the management and analysis of large-scale data. The technology developed here offers a more efficient solution to meet such challenges and its commercialization will potentially impact the practice of data management and analysis in a large number of industries including healthcare, retailing, and online advertising. Successful deployment of these the systems developed here will enable a range of industry sectors to efficiently harness big data analytics.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of a data management system with a novel software architecture and advanced data analytics functionalities built on massively parallel hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The technology features a data processing engine under a data streaming (push-based) design and achieves very high utilization of a multitude of computing resources on GPUs. Current experiments show that the data processing throughput and latency are about one order of magnitude better than best known systems built for the same purposes.  The research behind this technology complements current work in database systems and parallel computing fields. The system-oriented approach is in sharp contrast to existing GPU work that typically focuses on solving individual problems and thus highly creative. Innovations are also seen in the formal methods used for meeting system design challenges such as dynamic resource allocation in GPUs."

These mutations occur as part of an evolutionary process that may have begun decades before a patient?s diagnosis. Better understanding of the history of a tumor's evolution over time may yield important insight into how and why tumors develop, as well as which mutations drive their growth. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized how all aspects of the human genome are measured and have the potential to shed light on the molecular underpinnings of cancer and many other human diseases. However, realizing the full potential of these technological advances will require novel algorithmic methods specifically designed to analyze this data. For example, DNA sequencing data only captures information about the tumor at the time of sequencing, rather than how it evolved to its current state. While many algorithms have been developed in recent years to infer information about tumor evolution from DNA sequence data, this area of computational development is relatively young and many unsolved challenges remain. This project will focus on the development of computational approaches that enable improved inference of the evolutionary histories of cancer genomes, while simultaneously expanding undergraduate research participation in the field of computational biology. <br/><br/>The evolutionary history of a tumor can be described as a rooted tree whose vertices represent different tumor populations that existed during the history of the tumor.  While many computational methods aim to infer this history from sequencing data, there is much room for improvement.  For instance, the incorporation of multiple data signals (e.g., single nucleotide variants and copy number aberrations) has proven difficult and different methods may produce different results when run on the same dataset. This project will develop computational approaches that directly address this and other limitations. Rather than proposing the advent of another method to directly infer the evolutionary history of a tumor, this project will develop consensus methods that, given a collection of potential tumor history trees, infer a single consensus tree. Furthermore, this project will investigate both theoretical and practical limitations to inferring the evolutionary history of tumors.  This will include analysis of when large-scale events such as whole-genome duplications are theoretically detectable as well as simulation studies to investigate how practical considerations, such as: (i) sequencing coverage, (ii) number and distribution of sequenced samples, and (iii) noise in the sequenced data, limit or alter the ability to infer the evolutionary history of a tumor.  This project will be completed with the help of undergraduate student researchers from a wide array of backgrounds, thus broadening student participation in computational biology and computer science. Additionally, the PI will coordinate a cross-institutional undergraduate workshop on computational biology that will provide a venue for both students and faculty at baccalaureate institutions to interact and collaborate."

Deep reinforcement learning is a variant of RL that leverages the power of deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn both to extract information from sensors and how to transform that information into optimal actions.  The combination of RL and deep learning has generated impressive advances, but it is expensive, both in terms of data and in terms of computation: typical agents only learn after tens or hundreds of millions of interactions with an environment, making most algorithms unusable in anything but a fast simulator.  This stands in stark contrast to humans attempting the same tasks, who can perform well after only a few minutes of practice (or even merely watching another human practice for a few minutes).<br/> <br/>By its nature, this type of machine learning research builds tools for others to use. To connect these tools with disciplines outside of theoretical computer science and to improve outreach and education, this work integrates a new student exchange program, intended to both export results and to import technical challenges from other fields. The plan is rounded out with a mix of undergraduate research opportunities, competitions, and project-oriented classes focused on real-world systems and data -- all intended to spark excitement and communicate a hope for a better world through improved technology.<br/><br/>This work seeks to improve deep RL by addressing two fundamental issues: first, how to reduce the amount of data and computation needed by deep RL, and second, how to improve deep RL's ability to solve complex tasks by incorporating model-based prior knowledge.  The technical strategy builds on ideas from cognitive science, mimicing three key human cognitive capabilities lacking in current deep RL algorithms: (1) humans' native ability to build models of the world, which allows them to (2) transfer knowledge from previous experience via abstraction, and (3) reason explicitly about their own uncertainty.<br/> <br/>To accomplish this, this work combines the strengths of two frameworks: deep neural networks and Bayesian models.  The DNNs provide low-level signal processing, flexible and learnable model components, and powerful building blocks for discriminative inference, while the Bayesian models provide high-level reasoning about objects, causality, and theory of mind in a coherent probabilistic framework that can deal explicitly with uncertainty.  These capabilities are delivered by improved probabilistic programming frameworks that enable both the necessary models and algorithms: probabilistic programming permits the construction complex probabilistic models, and provides natural opportunities for integration with DNNs through automated inference compilers."

Transcription factors are proteins that function by binding DNA and turning genes on or off. AGL15 is an example of a 'bimodal' factor that directly expresses some genes, but directly represses other genes, and the focus of this project is to understand how this occurs. Because mechanisms of dual functionality are not well understood in any organism, the proposed work will have broader relevance to understanding these types of factors. Furthermore, AGL15 is involved in seed development, and seeds are of critical importance to humans, with the majority of our diets directly derived from seeds. Additionally, work will contribute to understanding somatic embryogenesis, a step allowing genetic engineering of plants to meet agricultural challenges. Training will be provided for a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and undergraduate researchers, including hosting interns from the nearby community college. This project will support a number of continuing outreach activities as well as developing a new relationship with an elementary school with a high percentage of students from economically disadvantaged homes.<br/><br/>AGL15 is an Arabidopsis MADS-factor involved in developmental phase transitions that directly expresses some genes, but directly represses others. The mechanism of repression may be explained by AGL15's interaction with SAP18/TPL that is part of a histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). This interaction requires an LxLxL/EAR motif that is found within the C-terminal domain of AGL15. The yeast 2-hybrid screen that identified these interactions also isolated proteins that could account for how AGL15 recruitment to gene regulatory elements leads to expression of direct targets. These intriguing proteins, which include another MADS-factor, SEP3, that interacts with chromatin remodeling components and a plant-specific transcription factor (LBD40), will be further investigated, as will the HDAC interaction, and in planta interaction with AGL15 tested. The LxLxL motif, needed for recruitment of the HDAC complex, will be assessed for functional importance in development. Prior NSF support has allowed the PI's lab to map genome wide association of AGL15 with DNA sites and response of target genes. Similar determination of the in vivo association of AGL15 interacting proteins will allow co-occupancy to be determined that may be revealing for mechanism of regulatory outcomes. Some interactors will be assessed for how occupancy changes from embryo to seedling. Prior work on AGL15 has provided clues as to how different complexes with different regulatory outcomes are recruited to specific loci. While mapping association will aid in determining mechanism, experiments are also proposed to directly address the hypothesis that activation may involve multiple binding sites for AGL15 and looping, whereas repression does not. Finally, select targets will be further assessed for epigenetic regulation and function in development. Training at all levels of science are an integral part of the project."

With its tunable energy gap, as well as strong ambipolar conduction resulting from its moderate bandgap (0.3 eV in bulk), the material offers attractive features for exploring new semiconductor device concept for electronics application. On the other hand, despite of promising potentials, major challenges exist on translating early science of black phosphorus materials into advanced device technologies. Novel device concepts unique to black phosphorus materials, as well as their fabrication technology, remain largely under-developed. Experimental demonstrations and design innovations of devices based on black phosphorus that may lead to novel functionalities, especially with re-configurability in its operational characteristics, remain rare. The objective of this CAREER program is to reveal the tunable electronic properties of black phosphorus such as electrostatic tuning of its bandgap and ambipolar conduction, and to build transformative devices for applications in electronics. The proposed research program includes the following activities: (1) utilize electronic and optical characterization techniques to evaluate bandgap tuning and carrier transport properties in black phosphorus, (2) devise novel device concepts, leveraging tunable properties in black phosphorus, such as the ambipolar conduction, and (3) benchmark black phosphorus device performance with the current state-of-the-art, and evaluate the new functionalities these devices can enable, (4) develop theoretical device models to predict and guide basic device physics research."

Building accurate records of past droughts can be complicated by mixed environmental signals in areas that were heavily influenced by prehistoric people. Variations in hydrogen isotopes in lake sediments reflect changes in precipitation that are unaffected by human activity, and the technique can be used on sediments from lakes that lack biogenic carbonates.  The researchers will study hydrogen isotopes in cores in hand from Costa Rica to answer three questions: 1) How do environmental histories differ across ecological zones and gradients of human disturbance?;(2) Can past variations in precipitation explain population shifts apparent in the archaeological record?; and (3) Does reduced precipitation drive fire at both upland and lowland sites, irrespective of human impact?

It also regulates the distribution of nutrients and their delivery to the sunlit upper ocean, and therefore the production of plant biomass, which ultimately supports nearly all marine life and mediates key carbon fluxes. Determining the mechanisms structuring upper ocean dynamics is critical to understanding how the physical climate system and biogeochemical cycles function. Moreover, climate change is expected to strongly impact these processes; thus, it is crucial to develop a capacity to predict their evolution under altered forcing regimes. This work cannot be done with coarse resolution numerical models because at large scales ocean circulation is constrained mostly to the horizontal plane by the rotation of the Earth. This constraint is lessened at smaller scales and vertical flows become increasingly more energetic.  This project will develop a sound, high-resolution numerical framework for evaluating climate change impacts on upper ocean processes globally and regionally. The tools and workflow for conducting such experiments will be codified in the Community Earth System Model framework and thus be available to other researchers. The study will provide an assessment of the importance of scales not normally included in climate scale models and projections. The results of this and any follow-on studies, will therefore be helpful in putting bounds on the reliability of current projections and in the design of future studies. The project also includes the training and mentoring of a graduate student and a postdoc, who will gain skills in model design, numerical experimentation, and analysis that are vitally important in future studies of societally relevant science.<br/><br/>Climate change projections to date have been done with coarse-resolution ocean models. Recent research, however, has revealed that submesoscale processes, at scales where the constraint by the rotation of the Earth is lessened, play an important role in determining upper ocean stratification, mixed layer depths, and surface-to-depth exchange. Critically, changes to the ocean mean-state under a warming climate are very likely to impact submesoscale activity, with implications for the lateral and vertical fluxes mediated by these processes. This project will use a combination of numerical simulations and observations to quantify the role of submesoscale dynamics in controlling net primary production and export production under present-day climate conditions; it will also examine the mechanisms driving changes in these processes under climate forcing representative of future warming. This is made possible by a novel experimental design that enables computationally feasible climate-change experiments conducted at high-resolution. This involves integrating an eddy-resolving (1/10 degree) global ocean model with biogeochemistry under present-day and future conditions, using anomalies extracted from fully-coupled ensemble integrations to define the climate perturbation. A regional model, nested within the global eddy-resolving domain, will be used to investigate submesoscale dynamics in distinct oceanic regions under different climate conditions. There will be a number of important outcomes of this research relating to changes to the ocean system under a warmer climate. The changing role of mesoscale dynamics in mediating biogeochemical processes globally will be determined. The submesoscale activity in a number of contrasting regions in present-day and warmer climate conditions will be determined. Submesoscale events, their underlying physics and associated heat fluxes as a function of season in both present day and warmer climate conditions will be quantified. The impact of submesoscale activity on ocean biogeochemistry under varied conditions will be determined. The degree to which the changes in submesoscale activity in warmer climate conditions impacts the overall change to the upper ocean physics and biogeochemistry will be determined."

This project aims to study the theoretical foundations of new features in these systems that are made possible due to the strong interactions, both at equilibrium and in dynamical processes. By constructing new theoretical models and by designing experimentally feasible ways to probe the predicted properties, the project aims to not only deepen our understanding of strongly correlated phenomena in condensed matter physics, but to also contribute to their study and application in quantum information theory, quantum field theory, and cold-atom experiments.<br/><br/>Moreover, as part of the educational component of the project, the PI aims to integrate novel concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum many-body physics into outreach and educational activities by developing a new course on ""Many-body Entanglement and Topological Phases"" for senior undergraduate and graduate students, and by organizing a ""quantum chess"" tournament for local high-school students, a large proportion of which are from underrepresented groups.

The goal of the project is to advance the fundamental understanding of quantum many-body systems, both at equilibrium and in dynamical processes.  The research focuses on systems with strong interactions, and explores novel topological phenomena and many-body dynamics, which cannot exist in non-interacting systems. The PI will rely on her previous research on exactly solvable lattice models, and on field-theory analysis and tensor-network numerical approaches to tackle these problems. In particular, this project will focus on the following topics:<br/><br/>i) Constructing and analyzing new discrete gauge theories in 3D,<br/><br/>ii) Interpreting and generalizing the topological order in 3D fractal quantum codes using a coupled-layer construction, with concomitant potential quantum-information applications,<br/><br/>iii) Mapping the Lieb-Robinson light cone in diffusive and many-body localized systems with experimentally feasible measurement schemes.<br/><br/>The PI will explore the non-perturbative regime of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, and will look for fundamentally new universal behavior. Potential achievements include: i) discovering new twisted-gauge theories in 3D and understanding of their properties both in the bulk and on the surface; ii) finding a generalized topological phase diagram which connects the fractal quantum code to more conventional topological orders, and constructing more physical models that can serve as quantum memories; (3) understanding the ability of various correlator measures in detecting information propagation in diffusive or many-body localized systems, and finding experimentally feasible setups for realizing such measurements.<br/><br/>Moreover, as part of the educational component of the project, the PI aims to integrate novel concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum many-body physics into outreach and educational activities by developing a new course on ""Many-body Entanglement and Topological Phases"" for senior undergraduate and graduate students, and by organizing a ""quantum chess"" tournament for local high-school students, a large proportion of which are from underrepresented groups.

This SBIR Phase I project will provide hospitals the capability of an end-to-end quality management that will track every production process step and tracing medications to patients.  Hospitals will be able to prevent patients from receiving recalled medications and identify quality production compromises thus improving patient outcomes and potentially saving lives.  <br/><br/><br/>The proposed project is a novel medication barcoded label encryption technology compatible with existing hospital scanners to provide track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds.   Key objectives include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance.  Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However, existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.  The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually to the patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted data from the EHR and will be connected to production data. Success of this project will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval of the serialized data from the EHR"

This problem holds important insights worldwide in light of rapid urbanization globally accompanied by accelerated slum growth, land enclosures, and rampant civil unrest. The doctoral student will document and explain why and how some forms of informal land-use practices are criminalized while others are institutionally endorsed or practiced by the state, and how such de/criminalization practices shape the differential status of citizenship and rights to the city among the informally settled urban poor. The project examines how government officials, city planners, global policy makers, land developers, local NGOs and residents collectively contribute to urban governance, transforming the city through spatial expansion and land-use practices. Results will be disseminated through publications and reports accessible to academics as well as government officials, city planners, global policy makers, local NGOs, and residents. Local outreach and dissemination is also planned via presentations and workshops, as well as via a subsequent online forum.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award provides support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>This project uncovers (1) the logic underscoring the city-government-planning complex regarding differential treatment of slum dwellers, how these rationalities evolved, and the consequences for slum dwellers; (2) the subjectivities and associated practices among slum dwellers relative to various axes of difference (class, caste, gender, religion, occupation, language group and type of land use) to de-homogenize this diverse group of actors; and (3) the various views among agents of the city-government-planning complex regarding displacement to de-homogenize the state, which commonly is approached as a monolithic entity.  Methods include a mix of qualitative and quantitative ones, including policy assessment, comparing published land-use plans and actual land-use practices, examination of census data, as well as interviews with residents, NGO workers, and actors at multiple tiers of the city-government-planning complex and collaborative research with slum dwellers. Although this research focuses on Delhi, India to examine how world-class city-making models transform the spatial and socio-economic composition of a city, the project provides new insights regarding issues of social justice in cities worldwide including the United States."

This project builds on the successful Portal to the Public (PoP) framework, bringing together the expertise and resources of HEIs and ISEs around the shared mission of engaging public audiences in current STEM research. The project is designed to address several critical needs: (1) Public outreach BI activities are relatively uncommon compared to BI that is focused within the infrastructure of academia; (2) Because collaborations with ISEs are frequently tied to individual Principal Investigators (PIs), there is limited opportunity to build a body of knowledge around the practice of partnering for BI work; and (3) Collaborations are often transient, making it more difficult for universities to view BI on an institutional level in ways that leverage particular institutional assets or strategies and even link investigators from multiple projects.<br/><br/>The specific areas of study are: <br/>a.  Develop and test a structure for education/outreach BI experience design that addresses a public audience need and meets NSF's BI criterion: The project will create disseminatable tools around the activity design process (including evaluation of learning impacts). By convening cross-disciplinary teams, the project will ensure that experiences will reflect a wide range of expertise and will help meet the needs of multiple stakeholders. These established structures will lower the barrier to entry for PIs who want to do public outreach BI.<br/><br/>b.  Design, test, and study structures for long-term, mutually beneficial HEI-ISE partnerships: The project will build on the proven PoP model to create flexible, disseminatable tools around the development of institutional partnerships at three collaborating HEI-ISE site pairings that consider each institution's resources, constraints and strategic goals, including a cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary Broader Impacts Design (BID) Team structure. Sustained partnerships will support ongoing public engagement with current STEM research.<br/><br/>c.  Anchor the partnership at the HEI with a representative from an office of research support: Research support professionals will be a core part of the BID Team and will help support institutional strategies for aligning BI activities with broader goals around community engagement.<br/><br/>d.

Such interfacial phonon scattering and its resulting interfacial thermal resistance are important to many applications, ranging from the thermal management of nanoelectronic and optical devices, to effective thermal insulation materials, to thermoelectric energy conversion.  However, the fundamental understanding of how phonons interact with an interface is still limited after decades of research, especially when the complexities of a real interface are considered.  In particular, the thermal resistance of a single grain boundary (GB) has not been directly measured for a polycrystalline bulk material or thin film.  Existing thermal studies can only extract an averaged GB thermal resistance by fitting the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of the whole material. To address this critical issue, this project combines thermal measurements and atomistic simulations to reveal the detailed phonon transport across individual GBs.  For general interfaces, the knowledge gained from this project will provide important guidance for tailoring the interfacial phonon transport by varying the interfacial atomic and nanoscale structures.  The integrated educational plan aims to involve undergraduate and high-school students, especially those from underrepresented groups, in cutting-edge energy research.  Innovative outreach activities also include developing a challenge for middle-school students in the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement program, and demonstrating the importance of nanotechnology research to the general public through museum exhibitions.<br/><br/>The objective of the proposed research is to better understand the phonon transport across an individual GB within polycrystalline bulk materials and thin films.  The investigations focus on GBs formed by two widely used techniques for materials synthesis, i.e., chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for thin films and hot press for nanostructured bulk materials.  Thermal resistance measurements are carried out on a single GB, using nanofabricated thermal sensors to measure the steady-state temperature jump across this GB under a given heat flow.  This will provide unprecedented experimental data for phonon transport across single GBs within these polycrystalline materials.  As a comparable case of a real GB within hot-pressed bulk materials, planar film-wafer interfaces by hot press are also measured for varied crystal misorientations across the interface.  All thermal measurements can be directly compared to predictions based on atomistic Green?s function (AGF) simulations that employ the exact interfacial atomic structure (e.g., dislocations, crystal orientation, roughness, nanoscale strain as atomic displacement) revealed by different microscopy techniques.  The integration of individual GB measurements and AGF simulations reaches beyond previous AGF studies that often use guessed interfacial atomic structures and are seldom validated by experiments.   Fundamentally, the proposed study will elucidate the relationship between the synthesis condition, interfacial atomic structure, and the corresponding GB thermal transport.  The success of this project will significantly advance the thermal studies for many important applications, such as nanoelectronic devices using CVD films and film-wafer bonding, polycrystalline thin-film solar cells, structural and optical bulk materials by hot press, thermoelectric materials, and thermal barrier coatings."

The goals of this REU are to increase the diversity and broaden the horizons of students engaged in computer science research. The themes of music, digital media, and cognitive science will attract many students from groups under-represented in computer science. Students who are already majoring in computer science will discover that the research in the field is not limited to traditional engineering applications, but can address questions of art, culture, and human psychology. Students with experience in combining computer science with humanistic research are already in great demand in industry and academia, and will help define what it means to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.<br/><br/>Students in the University's REU will engage in interdisciplinary research that combines machine learning, audio engineering, music theory, and cognitive science. These disciplines are united by their use of a common set of formal representations and computational methods; in particular, probabilistic models and machine learning.  In the research activity, REU students will work on topics such as using machine learning and wide-spectrum imaging to recover lost ancient musical scores; working with cognitive scientists to understand how prosody makes a person a convincing public speaker; and developing algorithms for synchronizing hundreds of audio and video streams of an event to reconstruct the experience of live music performances.  The University of Rochester's Department of Computer Science has a long history of contributions in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science is in the top three nationally. The University's recently-founded audio engineering program is growing rapidly, and the Eastman School of Music is the nation's premiere music conservatory.  Although the major objective of the REU is to encourage students to enter STEM graduate programs, many of the projects can be expected to lead to novel and publishable research in machine learning and audio processing."

Parliamentary coalitions generally consist of a senior partner that controls at least a plurality of parliamentary seats, and one or more junior partners that control the remainder. In this project, the researcher contend that junior partners possess significant bargaining if they can credibly threaten to pull out of the government's coalition. They can only do so if they can enter at least one other government that is likely to form and attractive to them. Quite simply, the greater the credible threat for these junior coalition to leave, the more influence over government policies they possess.  The contribution of this project lies in the introduction of the argument that credible exit threats as a significant source of bargaining leverage over policy.  A key part of this enterprise is the creation of a new measure of exit power. By examining who holds exit power in a coalition government, plays a key role in explaining not only why some governments spend more than others, but also the choices on how to spend.  Likewise, this form of exit power also helps to explain which parties some receive more party-based benefits such as cabinet posts than other coalitions member. Moreover, the novel interview-based data collected for this project enhances our understanding of the coalition negotiation and formation process in parliamentary democracies.  This, in turn, will provide greater insights into important areas of political science research, including policy making and democratic representation. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>	In this project, the author posit that the bargaining power of junior coalition members in parliamentary governments is determined by the credibility of their threat to leave the coalition, what the researcher calls exit threat. As such, the ability of junior partners to extract concessions increases as their relative exit power increases. The researcher creates a new measure of exit power derived from the likelihood of formation of each alternative coalition party could enter, in conjunction with the ideological attractiveness of this alternate government coalition for the party. One important consequence of changes in exit power is the effect on government spending.  The study finds that spending only increases with increases in the number of coalition parties to the extent that the strongest party possesses little exit power. As a party's relative bargaining power increase, however, spending also increases. Likewise, the type of spending reflects the preferences of that party more when it holds significant exit power. For instance, national security spending tends to increase and environmental spending tends to decreases when right-wing parties possess greater levels of exit point. To investigate these questions further, the researcher conducted a series of unstructured elite interviews with former party officials from a number of parliamentary democracies. Party officials include the extended party leadership, cabinet ministers, and members of parliament. These interviews are crucial to establishing the existence and plausibility of the proposed causal mechanism. Additionally, interviews of this sort also increase our understanding of the coalition negotiation process and the trade-offs parties are willing to make. Finally, they provide insights as to why parties find certain cabinet posts more attractive than others, which complements quantitative analyses on why some parties receive more, and more attractive, cabinet portfolios."

There is a significant opportunity for safe, inexpensive, and easily used method to purify water.  The innovation is expected to be eventually developed as inexpensive, reusable water filters for home, civic, and commercial use.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercialization potential of materials developed in the lab that specifically bind and remove pharmaceutical and herbicide contaminants from water.  The material has a unique ability to be functionalized with active proteins by gene fusion, without compromising either materials assembly or the activity of the added protein.  These functionalized protein-based materials can specifically remove bioactive contaminants and pharmaceuticals from water.   By adding new ligand binding proteins to these materials, the filters developed in this work can be readily adapted to bind a wide variety of chemicals and even toxins with very high affinity and specificity."

Students will be recruited from non-traditional sources including women's colleges and minority-serving institutions and will be provided with extensive support to facilitate their entry into computer science.  Support infrastructure will include a new scholar's retreat, a first-year seminar, technical support, faculty and peer mentoring, leadership development and service learning opportunities.  Students will also participate in Northeastern's co-op program, in which they are placed in internships in industry where they will both earn money and access a pathway to career placement.  Research on the different elements of the program will indicate which activities are the strongest factors leading to persistence in computer science education and ultimately to employment in the computer science workforce.<br/><br/>The program involves a two-semester intensive bridge program, followed by a Masters in Computer Science curriculum. In addition to scholarships, the project will develop, implement, and evaluate research-based interventions intentionally designed to address the particular challenges of students from underrepresented groups preparing for and pursuing graduate study in computer science. The objective of the program is to adapt a previously successful program (the ALIGN Scholars Program) to serve a group of students that is more diverse in gender, race, and educational and economic background than past students, supporting them as they move into a traditional Masters degree program. Support infrastructure will include a new scholar retreat, first year seminar, technical support group, faculty and peer mentoring, and leadership development and service learning opportunities. In addition, all students spend six to eight months working in industry through Northeastern University's highly successful co-op program.  Co-ops will provide a strategic pathway to career placements. This project will advance the state of knowledge about how to increase opportunities for success of students from groups traditionally underrepresented in computing through the design, implementation, and evaluation of a cohort-based graduate program in computer science designed for students with undergraduate degrees in other fields. Specifically, this program will: 1) Implement a cohort program to enable students with undergraduate degrees outside computing to earn graduate degrees in computer science, with an emphasis on increasing the participation and success of women, African American, Native American and Latino/Latina students, first generation college students, and veterans; 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of elements of the model using both formative and summative evaluation methods; 3) Broadly disseminate the model so that it may be adopted at other universities with similar goals."

Over the past decade, numerous preclinical studies and clinical trials using cell-based therapies have been performed to repair or regenerate a damaged heart. One of the major hurdles in cell-based therapy is a lack of mechanistic understanding of observed therapeutic effects. To understand the functional benefits of transplanted cells, it is imperative to study the biological activity of transplanted cells in the diseased myocardial environment. Existing models however, focus almost exclusively on mimicking the healthy cardiac microenvironment with the goal of providing a living surgical replacement. This CAREER proposal takes a principal tissue engineering approach to develop a novel diseased model in vitro in order to study multi-phase myocardial healing and repair. This model with independent control of cell and extracellular components will serve as a powerful tool to investigate the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and repair providing a major step toward making cell-based therapies more effective for patients with heart disease. Development and wide distribution of interactive educational and training tools developed in the course of the proposed research will facilitate fundamental advances in basic STEM areas as well as in the practical application of cardiovascular tissue engineering for regenerative medicine and clinical settings. <br/><br/>The objective of the proposed CAREER research is to advance understanding of the underlying mechanisms of repair by cell-based therapy in injured myocardium. The proposal aims to develop an in vitro diseased myocardial tissue model recapitulating disease progression following myocardial damage. The proposed engineered disease model will function as a ventricular pump replicating key characteristics of natural or infarcted myocardium. The specific goals are to: (1) Engineer a well-controlled diseased myocardial model mimicking the first two stages of the reparative process post-MI, which is the time when most cell-based therapies are performed. (2) Determine the interaction between host cells and transplanted stem cells and (3) Investigate the mechanism of the host extracellular matrix and grafted cell interaction to understand the specific role of the local infarct environment on transplanted cell function during post-MI healing process. The results from this study will address two unknown areas that currently limit the success of cell-based therapies for cardiac regeneration. The two unknowns are (1) underlying fundamental mechanisms that drive functional integration of the transplanted cells and (2) optimal timing of the therapy. Such insights will facilitate the translation of tissue engineering solutions from the lab to patients by enhancing the practical efficacy of cell-based therapy in clinics."

AGNES is a semi-annual algebraic geometry meeting organized at a rotating location by an association of northeastern universities. A guiding goal of AGNES is to introduce graduate students to a broad spectrum of current research in algebraic geometry. While meeting this goal, AGNES has become an important center for algebraic geometry in the US. The conference has an extensive record of promoting collaboration and has developed new tools for training and mentoring future leaders in algebraic geometry. These consist of graduate mini-schools, career panels, poster presentations for junior participants (including undergraduate students), and events specifically targeting members of groups that are under-represented in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a sub-field of mathematical sciences that studies solution sets of polynomial equations. It has deep connections to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as topology, arithmetic, number theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and homological algebra. At the same time algebraic geometry has found important applications in applied mathematics and computer science (computer vision, geometric complexity theory, numerical methods in algebraic statistics, etc). The centerpiece research activity of each AGNES meeting will be 7-8 invited lectures given by speakers showcasing different facets of algebraic geometry.

Meaningful engineering education research efforts that attempt to study best practices relating to the recruitment and retention of minority females in engineering need to be located in environments that demonstrate strong enrollment of a critical mass of these individuals in engineering. The fact that UDC is one of only two HBCUs nationally that offer accredited degrees in BME clearly makes the institution a strong candidate for study. The main elements of the project are premised on two pivotal facts: 1) the relative success of BME in attracting females to the engineering discipline and 2) the pre-eminent role played by HBCUs nationally in producing the majority of the nation's minority female engineers. <br/><br/>The project features three major components. The first component WEAVE  - Young Women Exposed Actively to the Value of Engineering  - will provide engineering exposure via hands-on experimentation with special BME lab kits. The second component REACH - Research in Engineering to Achieve a more Confident Her -  will impact female minority UDC undergraduate students' confidence in engineering via research problems in human health within UDC's Center for Biomechanical & Rehabilitation Engineering. The third component AMAZE - Accomplished female Minorities Add Zeal to Engineering - will counteract engineering stereotypes, and reduce feelings of isolation through mentor success stories and guest speaker activities. Additionally, the three-pronged WISE project will generate valuable knowledge about attitudinal effects of engineering activities and exposure to female engineering role-models on female minority youth interest, confidence and persistence in STEM."

Half of the undergraduate students will be drawn from enrolled students at Georgia State, with the remainder of the students recruited from transfer students from Perimeter College, a 2-year institution within Georgia State University. The focus of the program is to prepare students to enter graduate school or the STEM workforce. One unique feature of the program is the intent to support students beyond their undergraduate education into a 5th year Masters; completion of a Masters degree has been shown to substantially increase earning potential in the workforce.  The program will provide a comprehensive set of activities and opportunities for development of academic and research skills, with the goal of increasing student self-efficacy.  Students will engage in cohort-building activities such as a separate orientation specifically for them and text-based communication within the cohort.  They will also participate in faculty mentoring, career planning through creation of Individual Development Plans, enhanced research opportunities, seminar courses and workshops, and facilitation of industry connections.  Outside of the program, Georgia State provides additional services including career services, financial counseling, and academic advising to ensure student success on campus and after graduation.  Students will be assessed for participation and completion of program activities, as well as for academic achievement and progress both within the program and following graduation. <br/><br/>The objectives of the project are to: 1) retain and graduate upper-division undergraduates and Masters scholars in the Life Sciences, 2) develop the essential skills to be competitive in the workplace or graduate school, 3) build a sense of community through structured faculty mentorship and peer engagement, 4) study and report the impact of the implemented support structures on student self-efficacy, graduation and retention rates, and 5) strengthen institutional practices for the retention and graduation of talented, low-income students.  This S-STEM program builds on four support structures currently available on the Georgia State University campus and six support structures developed specifically for this program.  These support structures include cohort building, faculty mentoring, career planning, enhanced research, seminar courses and workshops, and industry connections.  These support elements are designed to develop six targeted skills in program students - metacognitive skills, data analysis, problem solving, technical/lab skills, presentation skills, and scientific writing.  These support structures and the enhanced skill sets of the students are hypothesized to improve their self-efficacy and eventual persistence in STEM careers.  The program design and research study will be guided by Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) that predicts how variables such as support structures, self-efficacy, career outcome expectation, and goals affect students' career choices.  This program will use a mixed-methods approach to examine how the proposed support structures affect these SCCT variables, graduation, and persistence in STEM-related careers.  Given the diversity and unique demographic profile of Georgia State University, this study will advance knowledge about how certain supports affect the career choices for low-income students, underrepresented minorities, and first-generation students."

These flow properties have important implications in transport applications, where the interaction between the vehicle surface and the air flowing over it leads to increased friction drag and associated reductions in fuel efficiency. Wind farms are another related application, in which the air flowing over the farm interacts with both the ground and the wind turbines leading to flow patterns that directly impact the efficiency of the farm.  The state-of-the-art mathematical models of the flow physics tend to be extremely complex and of high-dimension, which makes them hard to analyze and computationally expensive to simulate. The resulting models will be used to both study the flow phenomena, and to improve the accuracy of certain state-of-the-art computational tools that employ models of certain aspects of the flow to reduce the computational burden of numerical studies. Outreach activities at local Baltimore elementary schools and through a JHU summer program for high school students will therefore emphasize the connections between fundamental fluid mechanics and sustainable energy in order to put the mathematics and science they are learning in the context of pressing societal concerns.   <br/><br/>This project will develop a novel reduced order modeling framework that seeks to help overcome the challenges of characterizing wall-bounded turbulent flows, which is complicated by both the analytical intractability of the governing equations, and the associated large computational costs of fully resolved simulations.  In particular, the proposed research will develop the core theory and simulation tools to extend restricted nonlinear (RNL) modeling principles to wall models for large eddy simulations (LES), high Reynolds number boundary layer flows and wind farm flow fields. The RNL model is a reduced-order model for wall-turbulence that is obtained through a dynamical restriction of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations that leads to both simplified dynamics and an intrinsic order reduction, resulting in vastly reduced analytical and computational complexity. The expected outcomes of this work include a suite of tools for (i) analyzing and isolating key flow phenomena, (ii) developing mechanistic models of key flow processes, (iii) improving the accuracy of LES (through a RNL wall model), and (iv) designing model-based wind farm control strategies.  The research is tightly coupled with an education and outreach plan that includes training of two graduate students as well as activities for elementary and high school students illustrating the application of mathematics and science to improve the efficiency of wind energy."

The proposed work aims to advance current theories on NP stabilization, which are based on simplified, electron counting rules. The proposed computational framework will enable rational design of ligand-protected NPs.

However, the tools used to develop probabilistic machine learning solutions are limited in what they can express. Moreover, they require significant expert knowledge, and are not accessible to scientists in each discipline, let alone everybody else. Probabilistic programming aims to make probabilistic machine learning accessible to all, and as easy to program as a phone application. To make this dream a reality, probabilistic program execution, making probabilistic predictions from observations, has to become as highly efficient and robust as our current non-probabilistic software tools. This project develops general-purpose algorithms to execute probabilistic programs efficiently, using advanced symbolic reasoning techniques from artificial intelligence. Moreover, it does so for probabilistic programs that are significantly more complex than the ones in use today, involving a wide range of programming language features that are both discrete and continuous. This increase in scalability and expressive power will foster novel, increasingly advanced machine learning applications. <br/><br/>More specifically, probabilistic programs subsume classical probabilistic graphical models and are additionally able to capture complex probabilistic dependencies that include arbitrary pieces of executable code. While many expressive probabilistic programming languages have been proposed in recent years, the current bottleneck and barrier to success is the lack of general-purpose reasoning algorithms to perform inference with probabilistic programs efficiently. This research tackles two key problems in probabilistic program inference. First, current sampling-based algorithms have problems reasoning about dependencies between large numbers of discrete random variables and explaining low-probability observations. In one thrust, this project develops new inference algorithms based on knowledge compilation. This technique compiles the program into a symbolic structure that is efficient for probability computation. The algorithm does not compile the entire program, which is generally intractable, but uses importance sampling on partially compiled programs to sample efficient subprograms. This combines the best of approximate program evaluation by sampling with highly efficient compilation techniques for exact inference. Second, symbolic approaches to inference are fundamentally discrete and have problems dealing with continuous and integer variables, which frequently appear in real code. Conversely, algorithms for continuous distributions cannot efficiently handle discrete program structure. In another thrust, this project studies symbolic approaches to probabilistic reasoning in programs with both types of structure, using recent breakthroughs based on satisfiability modulo theories and hashing-based sampling. This project provides a scientific leap at a fundamental level. It also provides a context for training undergraduate and graduate students in subjects spanning machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics, and programming languages, and targets the integration of probabilistic programming into computer science curricula."

This dissertation project examines how wild orangutan mothers meet their energetic needs while nursing an infant during extended periods of low fruit and overall caloric availability. The research will provide a comparative model for human ancestors that may also have survived and reproduced through periods of resource uncertainty. In addition, Bornean orangutans are critically endangered, and research findings from this project will support primate conservation efforts. This project will also provide training in data management, behavioral data collection, and lab-based behavioral endocrinology for students from underrepresented groups in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>Research focusing on primate reproduction and life-history has revealed that primates have longer gestation and lactation periods, and extended periods of juvenile dependency relative to other mammalian species of similar size. Thus, it is likely that primate mothers, particularly those who nurse for multiple years spanning periods of unpredictable and low food availability, will have evolved a suite of behavioral and physiological adaptions to cope with the long-term energetic demands of motherhood while minimizing risk to her developing infant. This project examines the behavioral and physiological strategies that wild Bornean mother orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) use to maintain homeostasis across periods of infant development. The project utilizes several non-invasive methodologies: behavioral observations of orangutans, macronutrient analysis of food items, and physiological urinary analyses. This will be one of the first studies of a wild primate species to test if mothers modulate their nutritional intake and subsequent energetic status throughout lactation and infant development, and if/how they maintain homeostasis during this energetically costly period."

As an example, consider recognizing a handwritten word, where each character must be recognized in order for the word to be understood. It is important to consider the correlations between the predictions of adjacent characters to aid the individual predictions of characters. Structured prediction models are proposed to solve problems of this type. They have been shown to be successful in many real-world applications, including speech recognition, natural language understanding, and object detection in images. Despite its success, training a structured prediction model requires an extensive collection of training data. However, obtaining human annotations with complex structures is costly. For example, it takes a professionally trained linguist several minutes to label a syntactic parse tree for a single sentence, making it expensive to obtain high-quality annotations. The objective of this research is to develop methods that utilize learning signals that do not directly aim to achieve the target tasks. The outcome of this project will create a fundamental shift in the applicability of structured prediction models, enabling applications in which complex decisions are required and annotated data are expensive to acquire. This will bring new collaboration opportunities with other areas, including education, healthcare, and social and behavioral sciences.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to study algorithms for training structured prediction models from heterogeneous learning signals, design automatic algorithms for mining useful information from massive columns of structured and unstructured data, and apply the proposed techniques in real-world applications.

The results of the project will be disseminated by publishing papers, releasing open-source software and data sets, organizing workshops and tutorials, and creating new courses on natural language processing and machine learning."

This project explores how Chinese investment is shaping U.S. technology development and, how shale-gas investments and risks evolve as information is shared cross-nationally. To understand how the locus of control affects technology development in shale gas, the project investigates the complex interactions between national differences in R&D funding mechanisms, technology-producing organizations, and natural-gas geological structures.  The central hypothesis is that China's investments in U.S. shale gas will lead to technology development suiting its unique institutions and geology, affecting variety and selection of technology; subsequent shale-gas production will alter technology trajectories and investments in U.S. shale gas with strategic, environmental and national-security repercussions.

Archaeological research is well-positioned to contribute to knowledge about the impact rural farmers can have in these realms due to its focus on behavioral and environmental changes over extended time frames. Within this broader context, this project will generate an agricultural history for the research site, including an account of the activities pursued and crops grown through time, focusing on periods of high population density.

These systems may include ""smart"" medical bandages that monitor the healing of wounds and medical triage patches that monitor vital signs. Also, light-weight and rugged flexible decals are a potential application for inventory tracking, pollution monitoring, structural reliability of buildings/bridges in urban areas, etc. Currently, a typical fabrication approach to enable circuitry for these applications will use organic materials in a complex integration scheme with inorganic materials ""hybrid approach""  that will be more costly compared to the proposed work. In addition, a serious limitation of the hybrid approach is device and circuit performance limitations due to exposure of organics to the ambient. To enable high performance systems applications for large area electronics such as ""smart"" bio monitoring patches, flexible sensors, RFIDs, and microcontrollers, the incorporation of low cost, non-silicon thin-film transistor materials compatible with mechanically flexible properties is essential. Moreover, the flexible application requires substrates processed at relatively low temperatures (< 180C) compared to conventional silicon-based chip manufacturing. To address this performance gap at low cost, this research proposes exploring an entirely inorganic, non-hybrid semiconductor technology using chalcogenides (sulfur- and tellurium-based materials) and oxides (zinc oxide-based, nickel oxide and tin oxide materials). Using these semiconducting materials will result in a revolution of large-area/flexible electronics by enabling straightforward integration of multiple components (i.e., energy storage/harvesting, displays, and sensors) on a single substrate. Furthermore, they will have a resounding impact on the Internet of Things, medical, defense, and sensors by enabling technologies where it may not be practical and cost effective for silicon. Finally, the education/outreach objectives include engaging with middle school STEM educators for on-campus research in the PI""s lab and incorporating the experience into innovative curriculum plans to take back to their students. In addition, there will be implementation of ""units of learning"" that incorporate large-area/flex technology into advanced-level courses while also providing undergraduate research opportunities.<br/><br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to fundamentally explore the use of inorganic, low temperature (< 180C) chalcogenide- and oxide-based n-type and p-type thin-film semiconductors for low-cost, large-area/flex- compatible devices and circuits. The research plan consists of four (4) phases: (I) materials evaluation; (II) device fabrication; (III) device characterization; and (IV) device simulation/modeling. Using physical and electrical characterization along with modeling/simulation, a comprehensive investigation will provide fundamental device performance and reliability understanding. This work will provide the opportunity to have Cd- and Pb-free materials for p- and n-type semiconductors with high carrier mobility and electrical stability for implantable or wearable electronics. Furthermore, the demonstration of large-area/flex- compatible p/n junctions, junction field effect transistors, and thin-film transistors will truly take large- area/flex processing to new heights and permit complementary circuit capabilities, such as thin film amplifiers and logic circuitry, that have not been demonstrated using appropriate processing conditions (i.e., low temp) for integration into sensors, smart bandages, detectors, RFIDs, etc. This work addresses current challenges in large-area/flex-compatible circuitry where all-inorganic, n- and p-type semiconductor devices, and circuits are vital because an organic-only or a partially organic hybrid approach has more pronounced long-term degradation of organic-based devices. Therefore, inorganic materials and devices are preferred in order to create the needed circuitry. Using these semiconducting materials will result in a revolution of large-area and flexible electronics by enabling straightforward integration of multiple components such as energy storage/harvesting, displays, and sensors on a single substrate.

The focus is on several salient periods at the intersection of moving image technologies and the study of the child?s mind. It will study the use of cinematic methods for the observation of children in ?real life situations? by psychologists and psychiatrists such as Arnold Gesell and Kurt Lewin in the 1920s to 40s. In addition the development and propagation of one of the most influential psychological theories, attachment theory will be analyzed through the medium of film in the era Post-World War II. It will also address the rise of video technologies as both scientific and clinical tools in early childhood psychiatry over the last forty years. The researchers will inquire into past practices through archival study and recent approaches through oral history interviews and participant observation in an outpatient clinic for early childhood psychiatry. Overall, the project aims at contributing to a better understanding of the role of visual technologies in the past and present of scientific knowledge and medical treatment of the mind of the child."

These disabilities include reduced mobility, hearing loss, and respiratory problems. There is currently no cure for OI, and treatments relying on the use of bisphosphonates have questionable efficacy. With improved management, these children now progress to adulthood, where the challenge of age-related fractures occurs. There is therefore a critical need for fundamental, quantitative research into bone that can then support the development of new, effective treatments.  More effective treatments will enhance the quality of life of people with OI. As fracture and fragility are the main symptoms of OI, this CAREER proposal aims to first understand what features of OI bone make it more susceptible to fracture and then evaluate the efficacy of current therapies.  This will be done by examining the actual bone resistance to fracture. Combining rigorous fracture mechanics experiments with high-resolution imaging and innovative computational models, this project will examine the relation between structure, composition, and mechanics of the bone in OI with and without treatment.  This will then reveal the mechanisms of crack propagation in OI bone at an unprecedented detail.  It will also provide a foundation for the development of improved therapies that target the key properties in bone that will affect bone fragility.  The techniques developed through this project can be applied to any bone fragility disease, which will further advance the development of effective therapies for these conditions.  Improved outcomes for individuals with these disorders has the potential for substantial economic, health and welfare benefits to society.  The educational plan of this CAREER plan promotes training, mentoring and learning of diverse students, representing the next-generation of engineers. By broad outreach activities connected with research, we will inspire and attract children, students at any age and the general public to STEM disciplines.  These include social media videos about bone mechanics, learning modules for K12 students, and inviting young adults with OI to participate in workshops to learn about the latest research and bone mechanics in general.<br/><br/>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder that causes an extreme susceptibility to spontaneous fracture which then progresses such that skeletal deformities and severe disabilities result.  Current treatments involve the use of bisphosphonates; however, their efficacy has not yet been demonstrated.  By combining cutting edge experimental techniques for the analysis of fracture mechanics with high resolution imaging and novel finite element models, this project will investigate the relationship between structure, composition, and mechanics in OI bone with and without treatment.  Improved understanding of the fracture mechanisms associated with OI and the factors that cause the fracture susceptibility will support the development of improved therapies that can then target those aspects of bone structure and molecular organization. The educational component of this project seeks to increase understanding of bone mechanics and its importance, both among engineering students and the public.  A combination of formal and informal educational activities will reach undergraduate and graduate engineering students, K12 students, and the general public.  Activities are also included to encourage underrepresented groups, especially women and individuals with disabilities, to pursue STEM education and careers."

In order to encourage female leaders, many companies leverage diversity training initiatives or women-centered solutions, such as women's networking groups or leadership training. While these solutions have merits, they often place the burden of creating more gender inclusive organizations on women themselves. A more effective approach to enhance gender inclusivity is to understand the role that male leaders may play in supporting women's advancement within organizations. While many male leaders may understand the importance of supporting female leaders, they may not know how to effectively do so. This proposal seeks to identify effective behaviors of male champions for female leadership and for supporting gender equality in organizations. This research highlights ways in which males can contribute to gender inclusivity at work. Results from this project can inform organizations about how to influence, train, and encourage possible male champions to actively support female leadership in the workplace. <br/><br/>Male champions, or male leaders who value diversity in the workplace and support advancing talented females to leader positions, have a critical role to play as agents of change to enhance gender equality. The purpose of this project is to identify the effective behaviors of male champions. Multiple studies that utilize different research designs and methods will be conducted to examine these behaviors. First, we will conduct a qualitative study, which utilizes interviews with male champions and those who have been supported by male champions, to determine key gender inclusive leadership behaviors. Themes derived from the interviews will be used to generate a quantitative measure of gender inclusive behaviors among male leaders. Second, we will conduct a quantitative study to examine the relationship between gender inclusive leader behaviors and workplace outcomes. Effects of top-level leaders' gender inclusive behaviors on their direct reports attitudes and performance will be examined using multi-source, multi-level data. Finally, we will conduct an in-depth case study of a best practices company for gender inclusive leadership. This study will utilize observational data and in-depth interviews with high level leaders and their direct reports to better understand the processes through which male champion behaviors create gender inclusive workplace cultures. Results of this research can benefit workers and their organizations by enhancing our understanding of factors contributing to gender equality in organizations."

The steep rugged landscape interacts with a wet climate to create many kinds of habitats, each with its own responses to environmental change. These forests have been continually changing following the last ice age, and humans have played a role in those changes through the activities of Native Americans, colonization by Europeans and frontier farming activities, air pollution associated with acid precipitation, modern land use practices, the introduction of forest diseases and invasive species, fire management policies, and a changing climate. The forests of the Appalachian Mountains contribute ecosystem services such as carbon storage, nutrient cycling, water and air purification, and wildlife habitat. This research seeks to describe and understand how this ecosystem and the services it provides respond to past and ongoing change by using long-term data on forest composition and structure, soil characteristics, climate, and streamflow. The scientists will continue to add to the long-term data and will complete an experiment to assess the impacts of altering the plant community within the streamside corridor. Findings from this research will guide ecosystem restoration and management by land management agencies and Non-government organizations, and also guide the development of water quality policies at multiple levels of governance. Science findings will be communicated to the local community through the Coweeta Listening Project. The proposed research will create education, training and engagement opportunities for diverse scholars, students (middle school, undergraduate, and graduate), and diverse segments of southern Appalachian society including the Eastern Band of the Cherokee. <br/><br/>The southern Appalachian forest biome is responding to a series of past and ongoing disturbances including increasing hydroclimate extremes, higher temperatures, lengthening growing seasons, and continuing exurbanization. Experimental manipulation, observational studies, and regional modeling will be conducted to understand how this ecosystem is responding to past disturbances, land use change, and ongoing climate change. The manipulative rhododendron removal experiment conducted at plot and stream-reach scales will examine, by subtraction, how forest and riparian ecosystems are altered by the observed spread of the native invasive rhododendron. Continued monitoring of forest demography in long-term plots will build upon >20 years of tree demographic data representing >350,000 tree-year. Coupled with diverse spatially extensive climate and soil data and with data collected collaboratively elsewhere, these records will help examine interactions among competition, site characteristics, management, and past disturbance. While empirical work has documented changes in species distributions through time as functions of diverse and interacting physical, biotic, and anthropic factors, this research will rely on distributed ecosystem modeling to examine temporal and spatial ecosystem dynamics across scales. Ecohydrologic modeling using the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System framework will be used to integrate understanding of fine-scale ecological processes to examine the ecohydrologic and biogeochemical effects of forest change at basin and regional scales."

Relatively little is known, however, about the historic role of colleges in driving invention. This project creates unique data based on digitizing college yearbooks from the 1870s to the 1940s. The names of students from college yearbooks are matched to patent data, creating a picture of the role of colleges in promoting American ingenuity. These data show, for the first time, what share of patents come from college graduates and faculty. The yearbooks are also matched to historical censuses, answering questions about the mobility of college students. The yearbook data paints the clearest picture yet available of college participation by different demographic groups across time; the data reveal not only college attendance by women and African Americans, but also the college majors for these individuals, the sports and clubs in which they participate, and how their college experiences affect future labor market outcomes.<br/><br/>Important questions regarding the impact of colleges cannot be adequately answered without the kind of detailed student- and faculty-level data created in the project. Most notably, the college yearbook data solves three major problems. First, it allows for the estimation of knowledge spillovers from colleges by linking new inventions to faculty and graduates and distinguishing them from individuals who have had only indirect interactions with a particular college. Second, since the historical yearbooks give student names and identifying information, it is possible to track graduates across time and space rather than assuming they remain co-located with their alma maters. Third, the college yearbooks include information on students? majors, fraternity and sorority membership, and club and sports participation, allowing for estimation of the returns to education by major over a time period for which data has traditionally been very sparse, as well as an examination of how social networks forged in college affect later labor market outcomes"

But to reach their full potential, it is necessary to understand and realize novel processes to enhance their performance, either electrically or optically. The proposed processing framework has the opportunity of revolutionizing these family of materials, thus providing for the achievement of properties that otherwise will not be attainable. This is in addition to providing a unifying conceptual approach consistent with modern computational efforts that bring about a non-Edisonian approach to the design of materials and processes dealing with this class of materials. This research will directly lead to applications that deal with the preservation and extension of natural resources by allowing for: the availability of clean potable water through disinfection by the use of ultraviolet light emitting diodes, and the detection of pollutants and other effluents. The novel concepts developed within this project can also be implemented in the educational and outreach efforts (some specifically targeted at minority students), especially integrating materials characterization and control schemes to applications dealing with the need for the development of materials for sustainability purposes. This program will provide the opportunity to educate Ph.D. students on the growth, characterization and device fabrication of these materials while participating on an established international collaborators network. Furthermore, integration of these ideas into design of new courses broadens the community of students and experts related to the topic, especially those dealing with computational methods. From this, graduate students and group members will be able to effectively discuss their research for fruitful collaborations while accelerating their professional growth.<br/><br/>Charged point defects in compound semiconductors strongly determine electronic and optical properties. The energy of formation of a point defect is a function of the process conditions and the Fermi energy. In ultra wide bandgap materials or insulators, the contribution of the Fermi energy to the formation energy of charged point defects is significant. For the practical case of doping for n- or p-type conductivity, the larger the energy gap, the higher the concentration of compensating point defects that is at equilibrium with the system. This is a fundamental problem of these materials that will be directly addressed with these capabilities. In this approach, we will extend the concept of the quasi-Fermi level in an effort to quantify the impact of external excitation in the formation energy of the point defect. Increasing the formation energy of unwanted point defect through external excitation during a growth experiment leads to a reduction in compensating point defects and higher device efficiencies. The research objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the energy of formation of charged point defects could be manipulated by an external excitation in a steady-state condition during growth. Approaches include the introduction of above-bandgap illumination or e-beam irradiation as excitation sources. This process is referred to as Fermi level control of point defects. Three main research tasks are designed to test the hypothesis: (1) demonstration of Fermi level control of technologically important point defects during the growth of III-nitrides based UV LED structures, (2) optical and electrical study of point defects and their influence on the device performance, (3) extension to other wide bandgap systems and alternative Fermi level management processes to show universality of the process. This research will extend these capabilities to AlGaN for the engineered reduction of compensating and non-radiative defects in deep UV LEDs. It is expected that this process is generally applicable to a broad class of wide bandgap materials, in particular, several oxide systems."

This project builds on the successful Portal to the Public (PoP) framework, bringing together the expertise and resources of HEIs and ISEs around the shared mission of engaging public audiences in current STEM research. The project is designed to address several critical needs: (1) Public outreach BI activities are relatively uncommon compared to BI that is focused within the infrastructure of academia; (2) Because collaborations with ISEs are frequently tied to individual Principal Investigators (PIs), there is limited opportunity to build a body of knowledge around the practice of partnering for BI work; and (3) Collaborations are often transient, making it more difficult for universities to view BI on an institutional level in ways that leverage particular institutional assets or strategies and even link investigators from multiple projects.<br/><br/>The specific areas of study are: <br/>a.  Develop and test a structure for education/outreach BI experience design that addresses a public audience need and meets NSF's BI criterion: The project will create disseminatable tools around the activity design process (including evaluation of learning impacts). By convening cross-disciplinary teams, the project will ensure that experiences will reflect a wide range of expertise and will help meet the needs of multiple stakeholders. These established structures will lower the barrier to entry for PIs who want to do public outreach BI.<br/><br/>b.  Design, test, and study structures for long-term, mutually beneficial HEI-ISE partnerships: The project will build on the proven PoP model to create flexible, disseminatable tools around the development of institutional partnerships at three collaborating HEI-ISE site pairings that consider each institution's resources, constraints and strategic goals, including a cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary Broader Impacts Design (BID) Team structure. Sustained partnerships will support ongoing public engagement with current STEM research.<br/><br/>c.  Anchor the partnership at the HEI with a representative from an office of research support: Research support professionals will be a core part of the BID Team and will help support institutional strategies for aligning BI activities with broader goals around community engagement.<br/><br/>d.

The project aims to move from hand-designed strategies for interaction to algorithms that produce such strategies in a generalizable way, using models of human behavior and how a robot?s actions may affect people?s actions and perceptions of the robot.  The project also addresses educational goals that augment this vision: enabling the next generations of students to define and solve robotics and AI problems through a combination of computational and human-centered perspectives.<br/><br/>While robotics algorithms typically reason about the physical state of the world and how the robot can affect it in useful ways, an important criterion when interacting with people is how the actions affect them and their internal state: what they plan to do, what they think the robot will do, how much they trust the robot. The project will address this by developing planning algorithms that incorporate the internal state of the human agent that is not directly observable. Rather than treating the human as a physical (dynamic) obstacle that needs to be avoided, this project proposes a game-theoretic formulation of interaction, and introduces an approximation to it as an underactuated dynamical system: the robot has direct control over its actions, but its actions affect the human's actions, and so the robot indirectly influences what the human does. Preliminary results in a driving domain suggest that this improves robot efficiency and fluency of coordination with people.<br/>"

However, most solar cells that successfully employ this technique to date can only be produced using highly specialized single crystal materials. The complexity of growth methods and their use of expensive single crystal substrates have prevented these tandem solar cells from achieving low cost. This project proposes to explore stable and low-cost polycrystalline thin-film semiconductors, in particular one that absorbs the blue part of the solar spectrum, to enable low-cost and high conversion efficiency tandem solar cells. The integrative nature of the research and education will train and mentor graduate and undergraduate students in cross-disciplinary skills that are essential for developing innovative solutions as they enter the workplace and contribute to the U.S. leadership in the burgeoning field of electronics. The proposed project will benefit the education and research of graduate and undergraduate students and prepare them as the workforce of future energy industries.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>This project will develop the fundamental scientific knowledge that will lead to the fabrication of stable and efficient wide bandgap solar cells and eventually tandem cells made with two dissimilar materials. Polycrystalline thin film photovoltaic devices offer much lower production cost and complexity than epitaxial thin films, but their ultimate conversion efficiencies cannot go beyond the theoretical Shockley-Queisser limit for single-junction solar cells. A tandem cell made with two dissimilar materials, both low-cost polycrystalline thin films, would be an ideal choice for next generation low-cost and ultra-high conversion efficiency photovoltaic devices. The chief reason for failure to achieve high conversion efficiency polycrystalline thin-film tandem devices is the lack of an efficient top cell using suitable polycrystalline wide-bandgap semiconductor materials. Since the efficiency of a tandem device predominantly depends on the combined open circuit voltages of both semiconductors, a promising top cell must be able to produce high open circuit voltage. The proposed project will yield several break-through results: 1) approaches for synthesizing high-quality wide bandgap thin films will be developed; 2) fundamental defects physics of such wide bandgap semiconductors will be thoroughly understood; 3) buffer layers forming front and back junctions will be discovered and optimized; 4) Wide-bandgap top cells with high conversion efficiency and high open circuit voltage will be demonstrated; 5) If successful, it will enable the fabrication of low-cost and high conversion efficiency thin-film tandem solar cells."

The overall aim is to identify motives for charitable contributions and how tax policy that changes the after-tax cost of giving to designated charities affects charitable selection, allocation of contributions, and total giving. In the framed field experiment subjects will allocate a fixed amount between themselves and selected charitable organizations. Treatments will make salient that a tax credit is available for contributions to certain charities and vary both the number and mix of eligible and ineligible charities that can be selected as potential recipients. The experiment will allow the researchers to identify whether tax credits impact (i) which charities are selected as recipients, (ii) the likelihood an individual gives, (iii) the allocation of donations across organizations, and (iv) the overall amount given.  The research also uses data on a charitable tax credit program in Arizona combined with IRS data to explore (i) the factors that drive giving to charities, (ii) the impact of state tax policy on giving to eligible charities, and (iii) the impact of the policy on giving to charitable organizations not eligible for tax credits. To achieve these aims, the proposal outlines an econometric analysis that will use changes in the Arizona tax code that have differential impacts across charities to examine how opportunity cost and income affect donor behavior and competition among charities.<br/><br/>The project research provides a novel empirical approach to understand what drives charitable contributions. Specifically, the research will identify how donors respond to decreasing opportunity cost and relaxing liquidity constraints on giving. Second, it contributes to a burgeoning literature exploring competition among charities and how policies that change cost of giving to one organization impact donations to others. Third, the research will contribute to a growing body of work using experimental methods to inform policy design. It extends this literature by exploring a new application: the use of such tools to understand how states can design tax codes to increase private support for specific charitable causes and the subsequent impacts on the charitable sector as a whole. Finally, the research contributes to the literature on unintended consequences but is the first to do so in the context of an increasingly popular policy instrument: the use of tax credits as a means for individuals to redirect general tax revenues to specific uses.  This research will impact the policy debate surrounding ways to increase funding for selected charitable causes. One innovative policy to achieve such aims is to give individual taxpayers the power to direct tax revenues to charities of their choosing. First, by improving the understanding of what drives giving, the research will inform the design of such programs and identify new ways for states to stimulate private funding for selected charitable causes.  Second, state level tax credits may crowd out support for other charities. Knowledge of such consequences is essential to the design of effective public policy. Third, this research supports answers to the longstanding question of whether increased giving to particular charities expands the charitable pie or merely crowds out giving to other charities. Fourth, the research will utilize partnerships with nonprofit organizations to disseminate findings and promote the use of evidence-based methods in the charitable giving sector."

As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Given the limits of international peacebuilding interventions in sustaining peace in many places around the world, peace scholars and practitioners have focused on local peacebuilding practices in the last fifteen years. However, while this focus on local efforts in peacebuilding reveals the significance of practices and actors beyond the international level, most research remains focused on national actors and processes rather than grassroots peacebuilding practices. This project investigates one form of grassroots peacebuilding: the phenomenon of community-led peace zone. Through ethnographic methods of participant observation, semi-structured in-depth interviews, and archival research, this project examines (1) the daily work required from civilian communities in maintaining the peace zone; (2) the histories, values, and norms that the community draws upon to do so; and (3) the strategic relationships and interactions among civilians, state, non-state actors, and civil society organizations that allow communities to build and sustain peace. At stake in this project is a reconceptualization of peace beyond its dominant definition of the absence of violence, and peacebuilding as a state-led, expert-driven, and technical project of conflict resolution. Although this doctoral dissertation research project will focus on local peacebuilding in the Philippines, the research will provide new insights and approaches for maintaining peace at the local civilian level in areas with chronic armed conflict in many places, including localities in the United States."

In particular, phased array antennas are sought after in next generation mobile communications as well as wireless communications for military, space, and satellites. The proposed research aims to fundamentally advance the technical approach and methodologies of designing state-of-the-art phased array antennas consisting of reconfigurable radiating elements, featuring wide-angle scanning capabilities, adaptive aperture distributions, and multi-functional radiation properties. It has promising applications in mobile and wireless systems for homeland security, unmanned vehicles, surveillance, remote sensing, automotive radars, intelligent transportation, etc. In addition to the research advancements that will have immediate impacts on the emerging wireless communications, the project will also bring important long-term societal benefits. To address the noticeable shortage of antenna engineers and scientists, the proposed work will significantly contribute to the training of students by integrating education and research in antennas and applied electromagnetics, thus sustaining the U.S. competitiveness in advanced wireless communications. The educational component of the proposed work is focused on developing inter-disciplinary antenna courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). The outreach plan is to foster local community college participation in antenna research activities, engage K-12 students in workshops held at UAH, and attract young students, particularly from underrepresented groups, to study Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>The proposed research aims to address existing challenges of near-the-horizon beam scanning antennas with reconfigurable radiation characteristics and, for the first time, investigate adaptive phased array antennas with electronically controlled inter-element spacing. These are realized by utilizing adaptive antenna elements that can facilitate developing radiation matched elements for null steering and wide-angle beam scanning, without compromising desired antenna radiation properties. More importantly, the antenna elements provide unique features through changing their effective source of radiation, and thus allowing electronic control of the array element spacing without using any mechanical means. The proposed research provides a basis to further test the hypothesis of virtual array antennas, since each element of the proposed phased array antenna can be virtually displaced from its physical center. This enables new levels of real-time control of the array aperture fields by reconfiguring both amplitude patterns and phase distributions at the element level, as well as generating wide-angle scanned beams and adaptive radiation patterns at the array level. This will in turn lead to versatile functionality, reduced sidelobe levels, and suppressed grating lobes in the proposed array antenna. The proposed new technique of antenna reconfiguration has promising potential for the future generation of adaptive phased array antennas."

A generation ago, law and social science scholars outlined a new paradigm for legal scholarship, focusing on social, economic and political variables in the interpretation and execution of the law. Today, algorithmic processes, data analytics and ubiquitous social and mobile computing pose new opportunities for the study of the effects of law, rules, and social norms. These new opportunities invite the use of new methodological techniques in law and social science research. Yet few law and social science scholars are trained to understand these new computational processes. This is a pilot of a collaborative, multidisciplinary, cross-campus network brought together to plan and train the next generation of law and social science scholars in algorithmic processes, data analytics and the opportunities presented by ubiquitous social and mobile computing. It is for the development of a faculty board, new curriculum, and new training activities to be centered primarily at a Technology, Law and Society Summer Institute. The goal is to develop the updated training necessary to ensure that the next generation of socio-legal scholars are equipped to utilize new methodological techniques and new sites of inquiry. <br/><br/>Just as the consideration of ""law-in-action"" shifted the paradigm for legal research by expanding it beyond the exegesis of law as written and into the domain of what judges, lawyers and citizens actually do with law and how they understand it in practice, the interface between law and computer-based and other computational systems offers the opportunity for a new paradigm shift in socio-legal studies. The proposed series of trainings, workshops and a summer institute will equip law and social science scholars to develop methods for the study of these new legal objects and relationships. During the academic year, participants will test methods and formats for cross-training and collaboration. The broader impacts include training new researchers and helping existing law and social science scholars to re-tool; collaborating with the technology and policy communities to bring law and social science research to bear on their activities; and fostering cross-disciplinary, cross-campus collaborations."

Oxidative or reductive (""redox"") reactions that are mediated by microorganisms control the mobility and toxicity of Sb and As in the environment.  Whereas As has only one stable isotope (75As), Sb has two, 121Sb and 123Sb.  Kinetic isotope effects often favor faster reaction rates for lighter isotopes compared to heavier isotopes during reduction reactions (with generally weaker effects related to oxidation).  This causes a fractionation effect whereby the isotopic ratio in the reaction product may become enriched in the lighter isotope compared to the reactant pool.  Although isotopic fractionation effects have previously been used to indicate the occurrence and extent of redox reactions involving other toxic elements in nature, the extent to which bacterial cycling fractionates Sb isotopes is unknown. This study will establish the extent of Sb stable isotope fractionation during bacterial redox cycling.  Given the geochemical and geomicrobiological similarities between Sb and As, it may also be possible to infer that redox processes detected from Sb isotopic measurements are also actively affecting As when both elements co-occur.  The broader impacts of this project include an improved understanding of the geomicrobiological processes that control the behavior of Sb and As in contaminated settings.  Investigators will also train two MS graduate students and 4 to 6 undergraduate students per year through programs that target underrepresented students. <br/> <br/>The scope of this project is to investigate antimony (Sb) stable isotopic fractionation during geomicrobiological cycling between the environmentally relevant Sb(V) and Sb(III) valence states.  Investigators will compare the magnitude and direction of Sb isotopic fractionation during bacterial reduction and oxidation to that which occurs during chemical (abiotic) redox reactions.  They will conduct experiments with cultures of known Sb(V)-reducing or Sb(III)-oxidizing bacterial strains, as well as novel strains and microcosms obtained from a range of soil, freshwater, hypersaline, and hydrothermal environments.  The liquid phase and solid precipitates in Sb-amended cultures will be periodically sampled during the course of bacterial redox reactions and the isotopic fractionation factors between reactants and reaction products will be measured.  The results will potentially provide a new isotopic tool by which to predict the environmental behavior of Sb or to inform new strategies for bioremediation of Sb and As.  It may also be possible to use the Sb stable isotopic composition of ancient geologic materials to identify the presence of biogeochemical Sb cycling (and, by proxy, As cycling) in the geologic past.  This may provide a test for the hypothesized antiquity of As-based metabolisms, or alternately a proxy by which to assess paleo-redox conditions on ancient Earth."

They essentially describe as tiny perturbations (or fluctuations) in the functional parameters occurring in one area of the network, start to amplify while propagating through the dynamics of the network and ultimately result in extremely large deviations from the operational parameters in other parts of the network.  This undesired phenomenon is very common and difficult to avert in important practical applications. The proposal brings forth a novel mathematical description of dynamical networks introduced by the PI, which is capable of capturing simultaneously both the dynamics and the topology of a given network. Preliminary results for the case of a string of dynamical agents (vehicles platooning) showed that coupled with concepts and methods from classical control theory, this new mathematical description will be investigated for the development of practical methods for the design of distributed controllers.<br/><br/>For the case of networks with linear and time invariant dynamics, the distributed nature of the controller is cast as sparsity constraints on the controller left coprime factors, to be used in tandem with sparsity constraints imposed on the closed-loop maps. While delineating costs to specific nodes of the network, the constraints on the closed-loop map guarantee the tractability of the distributed, optimal controller design problem and characterize the manner in which disturbances propagate through the closed loop, thus eliminating the bullwhip effect.  The goal is to investigate the needed adaptation of the concept of internal stability of the feedback loop, which becomes necessary in the current paradigm of the distributed implementation of controllers."

There are many possible sources of linguistic misunderstanding, one of which is the cross-linguistic influence of the first language on the learner's second language. This dissertation project aims to examine the role of cross-linguistic influence in the domain of pronoun resolution. More specifically, this project investigates how Korean-speaking learners of English interpret English pronouns as well as Korean pronouns. Korean and English pronouns are known to have different properties, yet there has been no prior empirical investigation of their differences. By comparing the patterns of pronoun interpretation in Korean and English, this project can provide insights into misunderstandings due to misinterpretation of English pronouns by Korean-speaking learners of English as a second language. This project also has the potential to inform educators, language teaching professionals and developers of language teaching software about learners' pronoun use.<br/><br/>This project examines grammatical knowledge and real-time comprehension of pronouns, with a focus on how native speakers of Korean process pronouns in their native language, and how the properties of Korean pronouns influence the way that Korean-speaking learners of English interpret English pronouns. Six experiments with various psycholinguistic methods are conducted to achieve the goals of the study. The first set of experiments use two different offline judgment tasks to measure learners' grammatical knowledge of Korean and English pronouns. The second set of experiments use the eye-monitoring methodology to track the time course of participants' application of grammatical constraints on pronoun resolution during reading, in both Korean and English. This project will contribute to the fields of theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics by providing information on grammatical knowledge and processing in both native and non-native language. Given that Korean is a relatively understudied language, this project furthermore increases the visibility of Korean, and of East Asian languages more generally"

Linking the coastal and open ocean, they affect regional climate and ecosystems through the transport of nutrients, species and heat, with more direct influence on human population through the transport of pollutants and influence on hurricane intensity. It is well known that the Loop Current dominates the upper 1km of circulation in the Gulf of Mexico and is likely a major driver of the deep circulation. Despite its importance, little is understood about the dynamics of loop currents in real ocean situations. Laboratory experiments and idealized numerics (conducted by PI and his collaborators) have recently confirmed the existence of multiple steady states and hysteresis in loop current systems, as well as provided a framework under which these complex dynamics might be understood. That is, the global dynamics of loop current systems appear to be governed by a cusp catastrophe geometry of solutions. The objective of this work is to experimentally and theoretically expand the Cusp formulation of gap-leaping boundary currents toward more realistic oceanographic scenarios, so that such global dynamical systems understanding can be more broadly applied to actual oceanographic systems. This will be accomplished through a combination of rotating table laboratory experiments and theoretical considerations. The results of this research will better inform decision makers about the effects of climate change and other environmental stressors on semi-enclosed basins. The confirmation and systematic extension of the multiple states hypothesis (cusp catastrophe framework) in realistic ocean conditions will impact a wide range of fields. In the Gulf of Mexico, hurricane intensity may be predicted more accurately if loop currents are modeled correctly. It will also provide a means for ?bringing ocean education inland? with at least one graduate student and one undergraduate student participating directly in this project, but more generally it will help establish an inland hub for oceanographic education, thus exposing a largely unrepresented population to ocean science. The project will also serve to assist in the professional development of junior faculty PI, and the dissemination of results will present a unique approach to fundamental geophysical fluid dynamic interaction.<br/><br/>The cusp catastrophe perspective follows from a dynamical systems interpretation of the Loop Current (which in this case represents a global dynamical systems approach to Gulf of Mexico circulation). It has been shown that when the control parameters of inertia (current strength) and vorticity constraints (which physically relate to sea level, wind forcing, stratification and topography) are varied, the loop current systems undergoes global bifurcations. By tracing the Loop Current state on the catastrophe surface, transitions between a looping state, a non-looping state and a periodic eddy shedding state can be understood in a logical and predictable way. The cusp catastrophe represents a fundamentally different way of thinking about Loop Current dynamics. Traditional studies of the Loop Current have focused on quantification/identification of frontal eddy formation and propagation, barotropic and baroclinic instability development, and other local dynamical features. The cusp catastrophe formulation suggests that these local dynamics are merely symptoms of a global system bifurcation. An important consequence of this theory is that semi-enclosed basins are likely to exhibit extreme sensitivity to subtle climate shifting. It should be noted that the cusp catastrophe follows from a balance between inertia and vorticity constraints which are prevalent throughout the entire ocean system, suggesting the results of this study are broadly applicable."

New work at the intersection of psychology and economics suggests a focus on psychological micro-foundations. In particular, worries about financial problems may capture individuals? attentional and therefore decreases their available cognitive resources; this in turn can create behaviors that further worsen poverty. While previous work has explored these ideas, there is scant evidence of these channels impacting real economic outcomes. This project seeks to provide the first piece of evidence on the impact of poverty on economic field behavior: worker productivity. Results from this study would provide the first evidence on how poverty, operating through cognitive function, could directly reinforce itself. This would be a first step toward a more thorough integration of psychology within development economics, with important implications for public policy and the wellbeing of the poor. For instance, if the hypothesized effects are indeed at play, then impediments to productivity would occur precisely at times when individuals face the greatest financial trouble and therefore face the greatest need for cash. This implies that reducing volatility or mitigating financial vulnerability could have direct productivity benefits. In addition, transfer or public workfare programs could have productivity benefits that are unmeasured to-date. Finally, the hypothesized feedback effects of poverty would be evidence of an underlying determinant of persistent inequality and reduced social mobility.<br/><br/>This study uses a three-week field experiment to examine whether income directly affects labor productivity by changing cognitive function. The experiment directly and cleanly tests whether poverty affects productivity by experimentally inducing variation in financial constraints?via large lump-sum wage payments. To provide evidence on whether the underlying mechanism that drives this relationship is cognitive load, the design makes use of two complementary approaches: (i) It tests whether the estimated impacts of poverty on productivity are larger for a manufacturing task that relies more heavily on cognitive resources. (ii) It uses a salience intervention that directs worker attention to financial constraints, and tests whether the negative effects of this intervention on productivity are dampened when financial constraints are (experimentally) eased. Productivity, labor earnings, consumption patterns, and cognitive function will all be measured."

IDPs result from many actions including forced removal from land for the extraction of resources, and most resettlement is forced and into alternative rural spaces.  This project looks at voluntary resettlement into urban areas. Methods consist of a combination of mixed-methods (participant observation, surveys and interviews) as well as participatory film-making.  By examining complex forces in-depth this research will contribute a nuanced understanding of contemporary social transformations taking place in locations with limited economic development.  The investigators with work collaboratively with local organizations and as a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Resettled populations have typically faced enormous social, psychological, and economic hardships, which has been widely documented by scientists studying resettlement policies and outcomes. In recent decades, rural land acquisition for large-scale agriculture and natural resource production (e.g. mining, oil extraction, hydroelectric development) have accelerated human displacement and resettlement in many locations. Scientists who study internally displaced persons (IDPs) continue to focus primarily on forced resettlement, usually to rural areas, rather than voluntary resettlement programs to urban areas. This study will shed light on the factors that shape consent to urban resettlement. It will account for social, economic, political, and ecological factors shaping IDP consent.  In particular, the study will investigate three broad sets of factors: 1) political pressures on communities; 2) pre-existing pressures on rural economies and eco-systems; and 3) desires for social mobility through urban resettlement. The research methodology also features an innovative approach to social research by implementing participatory filmmaking among participating IDPs.  Although this doctoral dissertation research project will focus on case material from Ecuador, the research will provide new insights and approaches for dealing with the resettlement of internally displaced people in many other countries, including the United States."

These currents threaten over 200 million people worldwide. The currents are generated when mixtures of explosively erupted material are greater density than the atmosphere and are characterized by high velocities and temperatures making them particularly dangerous for people and infrastructure. Yet direct observation of the internal workings of these currents have been confounded by the difficulty in predicting their occurrence, hazardous conditions, and opacity limiting observation of the internal dynamics. These currents often have heterogeneous particle concentrations in a single current, so that a solitary event will have a range of spatial-temporally evolving and overlapping physical processes. Ultimately these currents are driven by the density contrast between the current and the atmosphere, and any process (such as air entrainment or erosion of the substrate) that changes the particle concentration of the current will significantly impact their dynamics. In this way, PDC are sensitive to and communicate with the atmosphere and landscape through which they travel. However, there is a distinct gap in knowledge concerning entrainment and erosion in PDC. The proposed work will conduct large-scale experiments and numerical simulations to determine internal physical processes in PDC. This information will be used to improve our numerical simulation tools to better understand the hazards from these flows.<br/><br/>This proposed work will integrate the results of several styles of experiments that emphasize end member processes and scales important for PDC dynamics. Select experimental results will be used to validate the numerical simulation of these processes, while other experiments will explore two important physical processes in PDC, entrainment and erosion. We will address the following inter-related goals: 1. Validate fluid dynamics models to encompass the particle concentration and fluid dynamics environment experienced throughout an evolving PDC, 2. Determine the entrainment efficiency of PDC and relate this to thermal evolution and transport capacity, 3. Assess the ability of entrainment to generate self-fluidization, 4. Assess bed forces from both particle and gas sources and relate these to the erosive capacity, 5. Generate modules for entrainment and erosion that can be incorporated into any numerical approach with a particular emphasis on rapid, end-member models to aid in hazard assessment, and 6. Develop a ""Fluid Dynamics of PDC"" video/lesson plan that highlights the visualizations from both experiments and simulations to educate students on the range of fluid dynamics in PDC."

Adaptive designs have been of great interest since the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved the concept and initiated pilot studies in 2004.  Unlike fixed clinical trials, where sample sizes are determined in advance and conclusions made only at the end of the trial, adaptive clinical trials allow for interim modifications in assigning patients to treatment groups, adjusting of dosage levels, or terminating trials based on developing evidence of success or failure.  Adaptive trials hold the promise of improving safety of new treatments, reducing time to market of efficacious treatments, and limiting exposure to inferior treatments.  Moreover, adaptive clinical trials can more easily incorporate patient heterogeneity (e.g., based on biomarkers or individual exposure), which may lead to more effective, personalized treatments for particular patient subsets.  The educational plan will incorporate adaptive design concepts in undergraduate and graduate coursework as a novel means of introducing optimal learning techniques.  In addition, the project will provide educational seminars on adaptive methods to physicians, nurses, and other healthcare practitioners who are conducting clinical trials through two collaborating healthcare systems.  <br/><br/>This CAREER project will advance knowledge by establishing unifying solution frameworks to two classes of optimal learning problems, namely (i) ranking and selection problems with arbitrary (possibly correlated) belief distribution and the objective of learning a population with a desired property, and (ii) multiarmed bandit problems with correlated rewards and the dual objective of learning the best population and maximizing the total reward, where at each period any subset of arms can be chosen any number of times subject to a budget on the total number of pulls. Novel approximate dynamic programming methods integrated with Bayesian statistics are employed to study the  solution space and establish bounds based on duality theory that will assess the quality of solutions.   The results will shed light on the role that patient heterogeneity plays in adaptive clinical trial design and should extend to other applications in optimal learning, such as dynamic pricing, revenue management, and assortment planning."

To illuminate these processes, the investigators will study the phenomenon of pre-diabetes in an urban environment.  Pre-diabetes is a new and rapidly expanding diagnostic category. The use of the term speaks to new methods of surveillance and management of glucose in the bloodstream. It is creating a wide and growing at risk population that is situated between ill and healthy. The project will explore discourses of risk and the imperative of risk avoidance. It will be of interest to clinicians, physicians, patients, family members and health care policy makers.  <br/><br/>The ?pre-diabetes? diagnosis is becoming a marker of individual health-status that is also emerging, alongside type 2 diabetes, as a symbol of national crisis. To analyze the pre-diabetes diagnosis in this context, the investigators will undertake 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork in an urban community. The project will be guided by four research questions: (1) How has pre-diabetes been produced, contested, and consolidated as a formal diagnostic category? (2) How is pre-diabetes communicated, understood, and acted upon both by clinicians and the individuals who receive this prediagnosis? (3) How is the specter of the pre-diabetic population mobilized political and cultural arenas? and (4) How does the case of pre-diabetes advance our understanding of risk as a social phenomenon? To answer these questions the investigators will conduct interviews with diabetes experts, healthcare providers, government and health system officials, health activists, and patients and their families. In addition it will conduct extended participant observation in three primary care clinics, in an educational program directed at pre-diabetics, and at scientific conferences. Findings will contribute to scholarship addressing the rise of preventive medicine, the associated surveillance of biomarkers, and the conversion of risk states into diagnostic categories."

Advancements in this field may lead to supported catalysts with very high activities, which will enable cost-effective and energy-efficient production of fuels and pharmaceuticals.   These materials will also enable fundamental investigations into the role of particle size in catalysis. The main research objective of this proposal is to leverage Reversible Ionic Surfactants (RevIS) to prepare highly active supported nanoparticle catalysts that do not require annealing and are more resistant to sintering than traditionally prepared supported catalysts.  The educational and outreach objectives aim to increase the motivation of underrepresented, rural high school students to pursue careers in STEM fields and to enable undergraduate and graduate students to understand and leverage nanotechnology to solve real world problems. <br/><br/>Reversible Ionic Surfactants (RevIS) are switchable molecules which display drastically different properties when an external physical stimulus is applied. In the proposed work, the RevIS can be switched on to act as an efficient surfactant and then switched off to act as a weak surfactant or non-surfactant. The central hypothesis that motivates the proposed research is based on the assumption that supported nanoparticles prepared via RevIS are more catalytically active without needing to be annealed and less prone to sintering at high temperatures than traditionally prepared catalysts. Monodisperse metallic nanoparticles can be templated by a switchable reverse micelle and subsequently deposited surfactant-free by leveraging the switchable nature of the RevIS. The proposed approach is scalable due to the mild conditions and simplicity of the processing required."

Attributed networks differ from traditional networks where only nodes and links are represented, as the nodes in these networks are also associated with a rich set of attributes. For example, in academic networks, researchers collaborate with each other and are distinct from others by their unique research interests or profiles; in social networks, users interact and communicate with others and also post some personalized contents. As an effective computational tool in analyzing networks, network embedding is a technique for learning a low-dimensional representation for each node in the network. Such a representation plays an essential role in supporting a variety of network analysis applications including community detection, link prediction and network visualization. While most existing studies focused on simple network embedding, the aim of this project is to develop novel embedding algorithms for attributed networks by tackling challenges brought by large-scale and complex attributed network data. The results of this project will be a new class of theoretical as well as practical network embedding methods to analyze large and complex network data. The developed algorithms will be flexible to be adapted for facilitating various industrial applications in Social Computing, Health Informatics and Enterprise Systems. This project will also develop a new curriculum that incorporates the proposed research. In addition, this project will allow the PI to continue the ongoing efforts of providing research opportunities to undergraduate students, female and underrepresented students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop efficient and effective network embedding algorithms to deal with large-scale attributed networks that contain complex network interactions. Given data from open networked information systems, this research will address the problem of attributed network analytics from two perspectives, i.e., scalable network embedding and leveraging network interactions. Specifically, this project aims to achieve the goal through two primary research objectives: (1) performing efficient embedding on large-scale attributed networks by developing two formulations from heterogeneous information networks and multi-view learning perspectives, as well as their corresponding fast optimization algorithms; and (2) transforming existing network embedding algorithms by leveraging social theories, e.g., social status analysis and social identity theory.

Such assistive robots stand to make a substantial impact in increasing the quality of life of older adults and persons with certain degenerative diseases. Additionally, the robot skills investigated in this project are suitable for manipulation in areas damaged in natural or man-made disasters, where building rubble and other debris need to be cleared.

The convolutional neural network model takes as input sensory data and a robot hand configuration. The network learns to predict as output a manipulation quality score for the given inputs. When presented with a novel scene, the robot can perform manipulation inference by evaluating the current sensory data, while directly optimizing the manipulation score predicted by the network over different hand configurations.

Nearly all American cities have alleys running behind their residential streets and commercial blocks. These corridors provide access to garages and buildings, circulate traffic, facilitate waste management, and are traditional sites of affordable housing. Hidden from public eyes, they paradoxically serve as both playgrounds for children and as sites of crime. Unlike most features of the urban built environment, they are public land whose access and maintenance is unofficially controlled by private citizens. This research investigates the ways that alleys have long functioned fluidly between the categories of public and private space, and have therefore been able to accommodate marginalized groups, such as racial minorities and the urban poor, who would otherwise not have had access to urban space. In the past decade, as many cities turn to sustainable design and seek the economic benefits of residential and commercial gentrification, city governments and urban land organizations have turned their attention to alleys, arguing that these ubiquitous city spaces can be revitalized as public space. Through attention to the ways alleys' semi-private and semi-public status have historically provided for underserved urban residents, this project critically assesses the seemingly clear benefits of public space painted by today's urban designers and by scholars who critique the neoliberal privatization of urban land. Research findings will be disseminated directly to planning professionals and to a broader public through publications such as op-eds and blog posts and will also be instructional material for undergraduate geography, urban studies, and history classrooms. The project will also provide support to enable a graduate student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>Despite their widespread presence and new popularity in American cities, alleys are conspicuously absent from literature in geography and urban and planning history. This research combines theoretical approaches from urban, historical, and cultural geography to tell a multi-decade history of alleys' changing functions and meanings. It contributes to scholarship that identifies ways that experiences based on race, gender, and class are embedded in urban landscapes. Finally, it uses the space of the alley to challenge static categories and prevailing assessments of public and private space. Through a combination of archival research, semi-structured interviews, and site visits, the researchers seek to understand the relationship between the changing built environment of alleys due to laws, policies, and technological innovations and the production and normalization of social hierarchies by race, class, and gender. Research will be based in Washington, D.C., a city with a recognized history of alley housing, one known for its ties between race and political-economic developments, and one that has recently turned to alley revitalization projects. In addition, as the only American city run by Congress through the early 1970s, D.C. is the best place to understand how national policies historically unfolded in a single city."

This research will better elucidate seismic source processes during volcanic unrest and eruption, potentially improving capability in volcanic hazard monitoring and mitigation. Long-period (LP) seismicity, a particular type of volcanic seismicity, is used routinely by volcano monitoring scientists to forecast and assess eruptions and mitigate hazards, but its source origin remains controversial. Sequences of LP events and more continuous volcanic tremor signals (collectively called LP seismicity) commonly appear on seismograms before eruptions, providing a warning, but not a guarantee, of impending eruption. This project will perform detailed investigations into the origin of an intriguing and largely overlooked additional type of volcanic seismicity: numerous tiny-amplitude LP subevents that accompany the regular LP events. LP subevents could be a useful new signal for monitoring volcanoes. This research will lead to improved descriptions and catalogs of seismicity for multiple volcanoes, generating a public database of information suitable for other researchers in their studies of volcanoes and seismicity. These products will be of interest to the geophysics, geology, seismology, and volcanology communities. This project initiates collaboration between UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, and the USGS. It supports the educational program at UC Santa Barbara by providing funds for graduate student support. The volcano-seismic event cataloging code will be made publicly available and will be useful to volcano seismologists for research and monitoring.<br/><br/>This project will utilize novel computationally intensive processing methods adapted from studying regional seismicity in Southern California and Hawaii. Tiny LP subevents have apparently been recorded at multiple volcanoes worldwide, but their origin remains mysterious. Millions of tiny LP subevents were exceptionally well recorded by a dense seismic network during the 2004-2008 eruption of Mount St. Helens (MSH), but were not cataloged or analyzed. These LP subevents contain rich, unexploited information that has the potential to better elucidate the processes generating volcanic seismicity. This research will map the spatiotemporal distribution and source mechanisms of millions of tiny LP subevents to high precision and determine their relation to other volcanic seismicity and eruptive activity. The primary dataset is from MSH, but additional datasets from Mammoth Mountain, CA, Kilauea Volcano, HI, and other volcanoes will be exploited for comparative analyses and hypothesis testing across multiple volcanic systems. This project will systematically detect and locate tiny LP subevents using a match-and-locate template matching approach, perform high-precision relocation and cluster analysis, stack groups of similar events (multiplets), and perform full-waveform inversion to reveal the moment-tensor and single-force equivalent point-sources. Integrating these results will help to resolve the relationships between seismicity and magmatic, hydrothermal, and solid extrusion conduit processes. The results will address the following questions: (1) Relocated seismicity will likely cluster into compact volumes, or align along fault, magma conduit, or hydrothermal structures: what do these structures reveal about the underlying volcano-seismic processes? (2) Do source mechanisms and locations of subevents reveal a dendritic plexus of cracks in the volcano groundwater system, or solid extrusion processes at the conduit margin? (3) What is the relationship between LPs and subevents? (4) Do LPs and subevents trigger each other? (5) Are these phenomena at MSH unique or is similar behavior observed at other volcanoes? (6) What is the underlying physical process causing this seismicity? (7) Can subevents be used to improve eruption forecasting?"

The ULVZs are so named because seismic waves passing through the Earth slow down dramatically when they encounter these zones. While ULVZs are thought to be related to melting processes, there is growing controversy regarding their origin and the role they play in the thermal and chemical evolution of our planet. The ULVZs may include the largest magma chambers in Earth's interior. Currently, researchers have only searched 40% of Earth's core-mantle boundary for the ULVZs and this project would use existing seismic data to map an unexplored area under Antarctica and interpret the nature of the ULVZs. This project will support two graduate students and create opportunities for undergraduate involvement.   Project results will be published in scientific journals, presented at science fairs, and communicated through the researchers' websites. The research team will also take part in the NSF-sponsored PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating) program to communicate the science to students and the broader community.  <br/><br/><br/>Technical Project Description<br/><br/>The National Research Council has highlighted high-resolution imaging of core-mantle boundary (CMB) structure as a high-priority, emerging research opportunity in the Earth Sciences since anomalies along the CMB likely play a critical role in the thermal and chemical evolution of our planet. Of particular interest are ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs), thin laterally-varying boundary layers associated with dramatic seismic velocity decreases and increases in density that are seen just above the CMB.  Many questions exist regarding the origin of ULVZs, but incomplete seismic sampling of the lowermost mantle has limited our ability to map global ULVZ structure in detail.  Using recently collected data from the Transantarctic Mountains Northern Network (TAMNNET) in Antarctica, this project will use core-reflected seismic phases (ScP, PcP, and ScS) to investigate ULVZ presence/absence along previously unexplored sections of the CMB.  The data sampling includes the southern boundary of the Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVP), a dominant feature in global shear wave tomography models, and will allow the researchers to examine a possible connection between ULVZs and LLSVPs. The main objectives of the project are to: 1) use TAMNNET data to document ULVZ presence/absence in previously unexplored regions of the lowermost mantle with array-based approaches; 2) model the data with 1- and 2.5-D wave propagation tools to obtain ULVZ properties and to assess trade-offs among the models; 3) use high quality events to augment the densely-spaced TAMNNET data with that from the more geographically-distributed, open-access Antarctic stations to increase CMB coverage with single-station analyses; and 4) explore the implications of ULVZ solution models for origin, present-day dynamics, and evolution, including their connection to other deep mantle structures, like LLSVPs.<br/><br/>The project aims to provide new constraints on ULVZs, including their potential connection to LLSVPs, and thus relates to other seismic and geodynamic investigations focused on processes within the Earth?s interior. This project will promote a new research collaboration between The University of Alabama (UA) and Arizona State University (ASU), each of which brings specific strengths to the initiative."

The event will take place as part of the first day of activities at the 12th International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI 2017), to be held March 6-9 in Vienna, Austria, and which is jointly sponsored by ACM and IEEE.  HRI is the premier conference for showcasing the very best interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research on human-robot interaction, with roots in diverse fields including robotics, artificial intelligence, social psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, human factors, engineering, and many more.  It is a single-track, highly selective annual international conference that invites broad participation.  Building on the ""Smart City Wien"" initiative, the theme of HRI 2017 is ""Smart Interaction.""  The conference seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, methodological, behavioral, and theoretical, that advance fundamental and applied knowledge and methods in human-robot interaction, with the goal of enabling human-robot interaction through new technical advances, novel robot designs, new guidelines for design, and advanced methods for understanding and evaluating interaction.  More information about the conference is available online at http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2017.  The Pioneers Workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities.  This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives.  Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years.  Participants will also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led.  The PI has expressed his strong commitment to recruiting women and members from under-represented groups.  To further ensure diversity the event organizers will consider an applicant's potential to offer a fresh perspective and point of view with respect to HRI, will recruit students who are just beginning their graduate degree programs in addition to students who are further along in their degrees, and will strive to limit the number of participants accepted from a particular institution to at most two.  As a new feature this year, the organizers will also invite 3 undergraduate students (all eligible for funding) to help increase diversity in the pipeline of students entering this field.<br/> <br/>The Pioneers Workshop is designed to complement the conference, by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference.  During the workshop, participants will talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field, encouraging the formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries.  To these ends, the workshop format will encompass a variety of activities including three keynotes, a distinguished panel session, and breakout sessions.  To start the day, all workshop attendees will briefly introduce themselves and their interests.  Following the opening keynote, approximately half of the participants will present 3-minute overviews of their work, leading into an interactive poster session.  This will enable all participants to share their research and receive feedback from students and senior researchers in an informal setting.  The workshop organizers will facilitate the post-presentation discussion and will encourage participants to ask questions of their peers during the interactive break and poster session.  After lunch, the remaining workshop participants will give their 3-minute overviews, followed by presentation of their posters during a second interactive poster session.  Senior researchers (in addition to those on the panel) will be invited to attend the student presentations and poster sessions in order to provide feedback to participants, and workshop participants will be invited to present their posters during the main poster session of the HRI conference as well.  The conversations between the panel and participants will continue over lunch and during dinner."

A new hypothesis contends that the topography of abyssal hills is closely linked to changes in sea level, and therefore to changes in Milankovitch cycles of the orbit of the Earth. If true, then the implications are potentially enormous: mapping the topography of the seafloor could be used to investigate Earth history, and thereby greatly enrich our understanding of Earth's varying climate associated with the changes in the orbit of the Earth. <br/><br/>The hypothesis to be investigated suggests that the rising and falling global sea level, controlled primarily by Milankovitch-scale variability in Earth's orbit, modulates the intensity of volcanic eruptions at mid-ocean ridges and, in turn, the formation of abyssal hills on the seafloor.  However, a connection between abyssal hills and Milankovitch cycles has been disputed by other researchers. There are two fundamental objections: (1) decades of observational evidence have shown that abyssal hills are dominantly fault-generated structures, rather than volcanic constructs, and (2) the Milankovitch Cycle hypothesis predicts that the width of abyssal hills will increase with spreading rate, contrary to observations indicating the opposite is true.  Nevertheless, modulation of mid-ocean ridge volcanism by changes in sea level is a plausible and, indeed, exciting prospect, and recent work on abyssal sediments provides independent evidence in support of the hypothesis. The central problem is that, if there is a topographic signal of sea level-modulated volcanism in the morphology of abyssal hills, measuring this effect will require decoupling it from the dominant fault-generated component.  This project will develop a methodology for measuring, if it exists, an age-dependent component of abyssal hill topography. The central hypothesis is that fault-generated topography is random with respect to crustal age, and can thus be treated as a correlated random noise process superimposed on any age-dependent (possibly volcanic) signal; this hypothesis is consistent with prior studies that model fault scaling parameters with random distributions governed by scaling laws.  The proposed methodology will stack, or average, large quantities of data as a function of crustal age so that the random component (noise) destructively reduces while non-random component (signal) constructively sums. Characterization of the abyssal hill covariance structure is necessary to determine the expected variance of the stacked signal, and thus to rigorously test the null hypothesis that no age-dependent topographic signal exists; the null hypothesis can be rejected if the stacked profile exceeds the bounds for a given confidence level. The methodology will be applied to three large regions along the flanks of the East Pacific Rise that provide the most comprehensive bathymetric coverage available along the ridge flanks."

Because of GO?s fundamental role in codifying, managing, and sharing biological knowledge, quality issues, if not addressed, can cause misleading results or missed biological discoveries. Enhancing the quality of ontological systems such as GO, though a challenging and arduous task, can directly impact the very foundation of data-intensive research discovery.  Most existing quality assurance approaches for GO have focused on the enrichment of concepts in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving biological knowledge. However, critical structural information represented by relations has been largely ignored in existing quality assurance approaches, making them inadequate for their intended roles. Principled, scalable, and automated approaches that can debug GO to generate programmable (rather than manual) suggestions, if successful, can be a game changer in developing a new generation of methods for enhancing the quality of GO. The PI proposes a Subsumption-based Sub-term Inference Framework, SSIF, for auditing the GO by leveraging both its underlying graph structure and a novel term-algebra. SSIF combines the biological knowledge embedded in terms, sub-terms, and relationships captured in GO that can automatically detect semantic inconsistencies and generate change suggestions for future versions of GO.<br/><br/>In order to enhance the quality of the Gene Ontology and other biomedical ontologies, the PI proposes development of a Subsumption-based Sub-term Inference Framework, SSIF.  The SSIF includes  three main components:  (1) a sequence-based representation of GO concept terms by using part-of-speech parsing and sub-concept matching; (2) the formulation of algebraic operations for the development of a term-algebra combining this sequence-based representation with antonyms and subsumption-based longest subsequence alignment; and (3) the construction of a set of conditional rules for backward subsumption inference aimed at uncovering semantic inconsistencies in GO and other ontological structures. SSIF will be implemented using scalable computational algorithms and applied to the GO distributions provided by the Gene Ontology Consortium. Two algorithmic strategies will be explored to perform large-scale, backward subsumption inference on GO using the conditional rules: (1) exhaustive, all concept pairs, and (2) the subspace of concept pairs within a special type of induced substructures called non-lattice subgraphs. If an existing relation in GO is inconsistent with the consequence of the conditional rules, it represents a likely candidate of error. The uncovered semantic inconsistencies based on a collection of conditional rules have the potential to automatically reveal local ?bugs? as well as potential systemic patterns for review and revision, to enhance the quality of GO and other biomedical ontologies."

How is children's development of this cognitive and linguistic capability linked to social and cultural norms? This dissertation investigates these questions by studying young child speakers (aged 2-5) of Amdo Tibetan (ISO 639-3 code adx) living in Qinghai, China, over 15 months of developmental time. Like other Tibetan languages, Amdo demonstrates an elaborate system of evidential markers--grammatical forms that speakers use to express their relation to the acquisition of knowledge (i.e. knowing something via hearsay vs. direct perception). Both the role that Amdo evidential markers play in spontaneous interaction, and children's longitudinal acquisition of this grammatical system, have yet to be studied. <br/>                         <br/>This investigation follows the ethnographic approach known as language socialization. The researchers chart the development of six focal children, by recording and analyzing their everyday social interactions. Looking across a 15-month developmental trajectory, the researchers identify patterns in the pragmatics (the social and interactive functions) of evidentiality used by children and their interlocutors. Ethnographic examination of language ideologies and the norms of sociality that shape verbal exchanges between children and community members will complement the analysis of developmental changes in the use of evidentiality. The results of this study will provide critical insight into the relations between social interaction and children's cognitive and linguistic development. The implications of the findings will not be limited to one language community, and can be applied through comparative analysis to enrich present understandings of the social, cognitive, and linguistic development of young children living in the United States. The dissertation project also supports the professional training of a Linguistic Anthropologist."

This I-Corps project is exploring the commercialization feasibility for a method to protect any amorphous shape with a rigid, adaptable fit system. There are many application areas where a method to form a rigid support system would be useful and transformative. For example, this method requires minimal, non-professional training and no water or external additives to catalyze the cure from liquid to solid. If results of this study suggest that this technology has merit as a medical device, it could transform the way patients are treated for broken bones, how victims are cared for in disaster relief areas, and how medical treatment is administered in the third world. Additionally, the current standard for protecting fragile objects during shipping is with polymer-reinforced paper, plastic peanuts, or sheets of air-puffed plastic. Objects of unidentifiable shapes could be more efficiently packed with this adaptable-fit technology. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project proposes to conduct commercialization feasibility research on a method for protecting any amorphous shape with a rigid, adaptable fit system. The proposed technology utilizes research in manufacturing techniques to develop a novel method for custom forming a rigid support structure around an amorphous shape. The method consists of a network of tubing that contains one or more liquids, such that an external stimulus may trigger the transformation of one or more of these liquids into solid form. The tubes connect in a lattice structure that allows them to expand and contract in order to fit to an amorphous shape. Exploring this new method of forming a rigid structure can advance the fields of custom manufacturing and rapid prototyping. The technology allows for rapid creation of a custom-fit part in the field, without any external tools."

Chiral objects cannot be overlaid on their mirror image and are fundamental to life itself. For example, amino acids are left handed and sugars are right handed. Light can also be chiral having either a left- or right-handed twist. Twisted light can interact or ""shake hands"" with chiral matter offering a rapid, non-invasive method for characterizing the structure of biomolecules. The first goal of this project is to advance the understanding of chiral light-matter interactions, enabling devices that can rapidly identify Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and advance the search for cures. The second goal of this project is to engage 3rd grade and high school students in science and engineering research through videos and mini-courses related to polarized light. Beyond these efforts, this project will directly benefit graduate and undergraduate researchers through mentoring; and more broadly, K-12 students with interests in polarized light-matter interactions.<br/><br/>Technical: Chiral objects, i.e. not superimposable on their mirror image, exhibit optical activity which manifest in circular birefringence and circular dichroism i.e., the difference in the refractive indices and absorption for left and right circularly polarized light (CPL), respectively. Structural biologist have long pursued these chiral light-matter interactions to understand the structure-function relationship in proteins. Unfortunately, traditional optical characterization methods provide low-resolution structural information primarily due to the large size mismatch between biomolecules and the wavelength of light. Nanostructured plasmonic devices can generate superchiral near-fields, which provide highly twisted light i.e., over 100 times that of CPL, confined in sub-diffraction limited volumes. Through this program, the PI will investigate superchiral light-matter interactions between fabricated plasmonic devices and biomolecules. This research will explore the energy and spatial overlap between plasmonic resonances and biomolecules in an effort to maximize the enhancement of the far-field chiroptical spectra of the biomolecule. These studies are expected to expand our understanding of superchiral light-matter interactions and lead to a new class of plasmonic devices including those used in early detection of degenerative diseases and drug design for their treatments."

This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies indicate it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. As a result, this project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project is a proprietary multi-tiered formative assessment tool that can measure real time student learning of novel STEM content obtained through a virtual reality learning game experience. This project will enable teachers to nimbly tailor future instruction with individualized student learning goals.  Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific learning and measurable engagement in educational games for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF?s mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.<br/><br/>The proprietary technology developed in this SBIR Phase II will be a first-of-its-kind assessment dashboard that will link virtual reality and web-based learning environments with formative assessment to fuel instruction and deepen learning.

The proprietary assessment dashboard allows teachers and players to measure their progress in real-time and identify opportunities to enhance their STEM learning. Using Unity as the platform, player actions and decisions will be met with tailored formative assessments and ongoing feedback throughout game play. This feedback helps teachers delineate where their students are along their learning progressions and fuels further instruction. The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base.

Nanobiotechnology is an interdisciplinary science at the convergence of diverse scientific disciplines that leverages the principles and experimental tools from the physical sciences and engineering to facilitate a better understanding of biological systems. However, interdisciplinary research in nanobiotechnology often does not resonate with students, especially undergraduates, due to the limited access and availability of facilities and research programs in the university setting, and the intimidating prospects of mastering multiple disciplines. The overarching goal is to attract and retain underrepresented minority and female students from institutions with limited research opportunities in science and engineering, and prepare them for graduate programs and careers in these fields. To accomplish this goal, the proposed program will provide an interdisciplinary research experience at the interface of nanotechnology and biomedicine to students. Through the program, students will (1) design hypotheses-driven research experiments to solve biomedical problems with engineering tools; (2) develop skills for conducting interdisciplinary research; (3) gain confidence and a sense of self-efficacy to participate in science and engineering research, (4) develop a greater understanding and appreciation for the benefits of interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>UGA will host 10 REU students over a 10-week summer program where they will participate in existing, interdisciplinary research projects that apply nanotechnology to specific biomedical questions.

Freshwater mussels are one of the most threatened aquatic organisms in North America, and much work has been conducted to understand and conserve them.  It is hypothesized here that freshwater mussels can survive for relatively long time periods (up to several decades) at a given river location even during high flow events with much sediment in motion.  To do this, mussels may have special adaptations that enable them to remain in place on a river bed during high flow stages.  Field surveys, numerical modeling, and experimental facilities will demonstrate that mussels on river beds can remain in place for relatively long time periods, to show that the forces required to move mussels out of their burrows are higher than expected values, and to illustrate that mussels can alter the flow within a river to aid in their long-term survival.  This work seeks to provide critical information on those processes that enable mussels to thrive in rivers, which then could be used to aid conservation efforts.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in field, experimental, and numerical methods employed in rivers and aquatic ecology, providing them the necessary skills for their future careers.  Lastly, an innovative interdisciplinary research team will be assembled to advance the fundamental understanding of how aquatic organisms interact with river flow.<br/><br/>Freshwater mussels (Unionidae) are one of the most imperiled aquatic organisms in North American rivers and much effort has been expended to understand their precipitous decline.  The current paradigm is that the relative stability (immobility) of river beds over long time periods (decades) is a critical component to the ecological success and resiliency of mussels.  Yet such information is in stark contrast to the central understanding of self-formed rivers.  This research program is designed to examine the fundamental interactions between near-bed turbulent flow and sediment transport within sand- and gravel-bedded rivers with labile beds populated by benthic organisms.  The focus for this study is an imperiled freshwater mussel, which can be considered an ""ecologic engineer.""  It is hypothesized that (1) benthic organisms like freshwater mussels can thrive for relatively long time periods (ca. decades) at-a-station in dynamic, self-made river systems with labile channel beds, and that these same reaches often experience channel-forming discharges, (2) entrainment thresholds for selected live benthic organisms in labile river beds are measurably greater than fully-equivalent non-cohesive sediment particles due to biophysical adaptations (ecological engineering), and (3) the constructive interference of near-bed flow, turbulence, roughness, and ecological engineering adaptations create a hydrodynamic emergent phenomenon, a ""tipping-point,"" that increases the stability of labile river beds at relatively high flow stages.  First, field surveys and numerical modeling will be employed at selected reaches of two streams with historically- and ecologically-significant mussel populations to demonstrate unequivocally the persistence of mussel beds in labile river channels.  Second, laboratory experiments, also supported by numerical modeling, will directly measure the lift and drag forces acting on burrowed mussels, with and without active filtering, to assess entrainment thresholds and near-bed hydrodynamics.  Third, a combined experimental and numerical modeling campaign will quantify the emergence of a hydrodynamic ""tipping-point"" wherein the fluid drag acting on a mussel-covered bed becomes reduced through the constructive interference of variable boundary conditions.  This work seeks to demonstrate that evolutionary adaptations promote hydrodynamic conditions beneficial to the persistence and survival of mussels in rivers."

Organisms in general have finite amounts of resources (nutritional energy) to invest in growth, maintenance, dispersal and reproduction. Allocation of resources to any one of these functions reduces the amount available to the others. This study will test the hypothesis that a tradeoff in the amount of resources allocated to dispersal versus resources allocated to reproduction serves as the physiological mechanistic link by which organisms translate environmental variability experienced in fragmented habitats into population persistence within those habitats. This study will test this hypothesis using a fast-moving ground-dwelling beetle in the fragmented habitat of the Southern Judean Lowlands in Israel. Through the outreach program Insect Discovery, about 10,000 2nd grade students in Tucson, AZ will use insects to learn biological principles in specially designed workshops and classroom visits. In addition, 66 undergraduate preceptors and 12 graduate students will be trained in science outreach and how to convey an enthusiasm for science to the general public. <br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation is a dominant feature of landscapes particularly where intensive cultivation results in increased fragmentation of natural habitats. A novel, integrative conceptual framework is proposed in which spatial characteristics of the environment, imposed by fragmentation, lead to specific life-history traits that increase individual survival and decrease the likelihood of population extinction. As habitat fragmentation increases, organisms should invest more into dispersal and less into reproduction, resulting in a resource allocation tradeoff between reproduction and dispersal along a habitat fragmentation gradient. Emerging from this are three explicit and testable hypotheses that predict that the dispersal-reproduction tradeoff is the mechanistic link by which organisms translate environmental variation created by habitat fragmentation into variation in species abundances that lower local extinction probability and increase population persistence. These hypotheses will be tested in a well-studied fragmented landscape in the Southern Judea Lowlands of Israel, focusing on a fast-moving, ground-dwelling beetle. This study brings together techniques from landscape ecology and ecological physiology across multiple scales, from the individual, to patches, to populations, to whole landscapes. This project will support Insect Discovery, an outreach program that uses insects to teach biological principles to nearly 10,000 2nd grade students in Tucson, AZ, most of whom are economically disadvantaged, underserved minorities. In addition, 66 undergraduate preceptors and 12 graduate students will be trained in science outreach and how to convey an enthusiasm for science to the general public."

Significant progress has been made in characterizing the turbulent multiphase flow dispersed with spherical particles; much less is known, however, about another large category with dispersed phase consisting of deformable liquid drops or gas bubbles. Those particles can freely deform, tumble, break up and coalesce in turbulent flow, adding new degrees of freedom to an already complex problem. <br/><br/>The key questions arise as to what are the statistics of unique dynamics of these deformable particles and how to characterize their complex couplings with the carrier phase. In order to address those questions and gain insights in the full physical picture of the dynamics of deformable particles, the project involves a multiscale experimental framework on several different length scales from interface dynamics to large-scale statistics. In order to obtain couplings of two phases, both the carrier phase and the dispersed phases will be tracked in the Lagrangian framework simultaneously. This enables us to measure, not only the velocity of both phases, but also those high-order derivatives, including acceleration and velocity gradient tensor, that are more important to the momentum couplings between two phases."

AGNES is a semi-annual algebraic geometry meeting organized at a rotating location by an association of northeastern universities. A guiding goal of AGNES is to introduce graduate students to a broad spectrum of current research in algebraic geometry. While meeting this goal, AGNES has become an important center for algebraic geometry in the US. The conference has an extensive record of promoting collaboration and has developed new tools for training and mentoring future leaders in algebraic geometry. These consist of graduate mini-schools, career panels, poster presentations for junior participants (including undergraduate students), and events specifically targeting members of groups that are under-represented in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a sub-field of mathematical sciences that studies solution sets of polynomial equations. It has deep connections to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as topology, arithmetic, number theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and homological algebra. At the same time algebraic geometry has found important applications in applied mathematics and computer science (computer vision, geometric complexity theory, numerical methods in algebraic statistics, etc). The centerpiece research activity of each AGNES meeting will be 7-8 invited lectures given by speakers showcasing different facets of algebraic geometry. The scientific scope of AGNES will be further expanded by lectures from neighboring mathematical subjects (such as arithmetic geometry, dynamics, complex geometry, and computational geometry) and by the various supporting activities described above.

The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, which is accompanied by excessive absorption of sunlight by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity.  The deficiency in simulated cloud cover is most pronounced in boundary layer and lower-tropospheric clouds (tops below 3km) in the cold, dry sectors of frontal weather systems traveling along the SO storm track.<br/><br/>The work funded under this award is part of a larger field campaign titled Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The primary activity of the campaign is the deployment of a Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The GV will be based in Hobart, Australia and make multiple flights across the South Polar front collecting data on SO clouds and the meteorological conditions in which they occur. The GV is equipped with dropsondes to record ambient meteorological conditions, radar and lidar to observe the clouds, and instruments mounted on the wings or positioned behind inlets to to sample, collect and analyze aerosols and cloud particles (liquid droplets and ice crystals). The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South.<br/><br/>A key issue to be addressed in the campaign is the relative abundance of supercooled liquid water (SLW) droplets and ice particles in SO clouds, as SLW is more prevalent in SO clouds than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The PIs hypothesize that the extent to which SLW cloud droplets freeze into ice particles is more strongly modulated in SO clouds by the vigor of cloud updrafts than by the availability of Ice nucleating particles (INPs, particles within liquid droplets which trigger freezing). The PIs also seek to determine the relative influence of overlying free tropospheric aerosol concentrations versus local surface and boundary layer controls, including precipitation and wind speed, in determining the concentration of liquid droplets in boundary layer clouds.<br/><br/>Work funded under this award contributes to SOCRATES by measuring aerosol and cloud hydrometeor properties, specifically addressing three questions (from the proposal summary):<br/><br/>1) What are the chemical and physical properties of sub-micron and coarse-mode aerosol particles in the region, and how do they relate to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN, particles around which cloud droplets form), INP, and cloud properties?<br/><br/>2) What fraction of SO condensed water remains supercooled as a function of temperature, and can this be related to a dearth of INPs?<br/><br/>3) What is the role of biological aerosol particles in cloud formation over the SO?<br/><br/>These questions are addressed through in-situ air sampling using inlets available on the GV.  Sampling of cloudy air uses a specialized inlet known as a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI), which separates cloud droplets and ice crystals from smaller aerosol particles and other non-cloud material. Droplets and ice crystals are heated in the CVI to evaporate their water substance and the resulting vapor is measured with a laser hygrometer to determine total condensed water content.  Once the water is evaporated the droplets and ice are reduced to their nucleating particles (referred to as residual particles), which are counted and sized using an aerosol spectrometer.  A fluorescence-based spectrometer is used to separately count and size biological particles so that their role in nucleation can be assessed.  Residual particles are collected on slides for laboratory analysis using electron and X-ray microscopy that can determine morphology, composition, and mixing state. A key question in the analysis is the hygroscopicity of the particles, meaning their ability to absorb water vapor and thus serve as CCN. Additional measurements from wing-mounted supercooled liquid probes are used to estimate the ratio of SLW to ice content in the clouds.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the potentially significant role of SO clouds in determining the sensitivity of global climate to external forcing from greenhouse gas increases and other factors. Data from the campaign will be used to develop better representations of clouds in models used for weather prediction and climate impacts assessments. The data will be made available to the worldwide scientific community, thus the campaign has broader impacts by creating a community resource for basic science research.  A further contribution to basic research is the development of a clean-in-place system for the CVI inlet, which will improve the reliability of the CVI for future users, particular in salty marine environments.  Campaign outreach to K-12 students and the general public is conducted through regular newsletters and blogs, and an interactive ""Ask SOCRATES"" website. Events in which campaign videos, microscope images of cloud particles, and aerosol samples collected during the campaign are presented to the general public, are also planned.  This award provides support and training to a graduate student and funds the participation of a second student in the campaign, thereby contribution to the development of the future workforce in this research area."

However, very little is known about this process including how certain locations become hubs for international surrogacy, the experiences of women serving as surrogate mothers, and the impact of this industry on local politics and economics in newly-established surrogacy hubs. This project will deliver much needed empirical data on the operation and organization of the industry, as well as the experiences of surrogate mothers and intended parents. The study will also contribute to debates about the feasibility and merits of regulating surrogacy at the international level. This study will provide a platform for presenting the voices of the women who are most affected by this industry but are often unheard in legal and moral debates about surrogacy. This project will be of interest to policy makers, health care providers, and users.<br/><br/><br/>This study will contribute to an ongoing discussion of the relationship between developments in medical technologies and the emergence of new global markets. This research addresses the intellectual, material, and social problem of regulating new technological possibilities in a globalized world. This project is a multi-sited ethnographic study of the surrogacy industry. Employing a combination of observation, interviews, and archival research, the investigators will collect information about 1) the history and organization of the surrogacy industry, 2) the key actors, including the history of their involvement in surrogacy, and 3) the everyday processes through which commercial surrogacy is negotiated and experienced. The researchers will investigate how and why nations and communities became a global surrogacy destination, how the surrogacy industry is organized, and how the market reacts to changing regulations."

To allow the entire system to function efficiently, these components must communicate with each other and use the exchanged information in order to estimate the state of the entire system and take optimal actions.  However, such large-scale networked systems are also increasingly under threat from sophisticated cyber-attacks that can compromise some of the components and cause them to behave erratically or inject malicious information into the network.  Existing algorithms for distributed coordination in large-scale networks are highly vulnerable to such attacks.  This project will address this critical problem by creating new algorithms to enable components in large-scale networks to cooperatively take optimal actions and estimate the state of the system despite attacks on a large number of the components.  The algorithms will provide provable security and performance guarantees, and identify characteristics of networks and algorithms that are vulnerable to attacks.  The project will identify new ways to design networks that provide a desired level of resilience to attacks.  The algorithms that arise from the research will enable the design of more secure networks and critical infrastructure that remain functional under attacks, with substantial benefits to society.  In addition to the technical and scientific contributions, the project will also train students in the design of secure networked systems, and will engage the local community in central Indiana in learning about networks via interactive exhibits and workshops at the local museum.<br/><br/>This proposal presents an integrated research and education program focused on establishing the foundations of distributed optimization, learning, and estimation algorithms that are resilient to attacks.  The research agenda is focused along three thrusts: (i) designing resilient algorithms for distributed optimization of static objective functions, (ii) designing resilient learning algorithms for settings where optimization objectives change over time, and (iii) designing resilient distributed state estimators for large scale dynamical systems.  The three research thrusts each lead to new theoretical contributions.  First, the proposed research will establish new metrics for measuring resilience in distributed optimization algorithms, and will build upon commonly studied optimization approaches (which are highly vulnerable to adversaries in their existing forms) to derive resilient distributed optimization algorithms.  Second, it will establish new fundamental lower bounds on the regret that can be achieved with distributed online learning algorithms under adversarial behavior, and characterize achievable regret bounds via the design of new learning algorithms.  Third, the proposed research will investigate the interplay between the dynamics of underlying physical systems and the communication network topology between distributed observers in order to design resilient distributed state estimation schemes. The proposed research will lead to a greater understanding of the fundamental factors that affect the resilience of distributed optimization, learning, and estimation dynamics, and establish systematic procedures to design large-scale networked systems that are capable of operating in a near-optimal manner under attacks.  Given the lack of existing work on this topic, the research will lay the groundwork for substantial further explorations of resilient algorithms for distributed decision-making and coordination in large-scale networks."

However, most solar cells that successfully employ this technique to date can only be produced using highly specialized single crystal materials. The complexity of growth methods and their use of expensive single crystal substrates have prevented these tandem solar cells from achieving low cost. This project proposes to explore stable and low-cost polycrystalline thin-film semiconductors, in particular one that absorbs the blue part of the solar spectrum, to enable low-cost and high conversion efficiency tandem solar cells. The integrative nature of the research and education will train and mentor graduate and undergraduate students in cross-disciplinary skills that are essential for developing innovative solutions as they enter the workplace and contribute to the U.S. leadership in the burgeoning field of electronics. The proposed project will benefit the education and research of graduate and undergraduate students and prepare them as the workforce of future energy industries.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>This project will develop the fundamental scientific knowledge that will lead to the fabrication of stable and efficient wide bandgap solar cells and eventually tandem cells made with two dissimilar materials. Polycrystalline thin film photovoltaic devices offer much lower production cost and complexity than epitaxial thin films, but their ultimate conversion efficiencies cannot go beyond the theoretical Shockley-Queisser limit for single-junction solar cells. A tandem cell made with two dissimilar materials, both low-cost polycrystalline thin films, would be an ideal choice for next generation low-cost and ultra-high conversion efficiency photovoltaic devices. The chief reason for failure to achieve high conversion efficiency polycrystalline thin-film tandem devices is the lack of an efficient top cell using suitable polycrystalline wide-bandgap semiconductor materials. Since the efficiency of a tandem device predominantly depends on the combined open circuit voltages of both semiconductors, a promising top cell must be able to produce high open circuit voltage. The proposed project will yield several break-through results: 1) approaches for synthesizing high-quality wide bandgap thin films will be developed; 2) fundamental defects physics of such wide bandgap semiconductors will be thoroughly understood; 3) buffer layers forming front and back junctions will be discovered and optimized; 4) Wide-bandgap top cells with high conversion efficiency and high open circuit voltage will be demonstrated; 5) If successful, it will enable the fabrication of low-cost and high conversion efficiency thin-film tandem solar cells."

The recent deliberate inclusion of investigators working on other non-canonical model systems has made it a unique and important meeting for a broader community of developmental biologists.  The DBSU meeting now includes participation of researchers working on the cell and developmental biology of other marine invertebrate models (e.g. other echinoderms, tunicates, hemichordates, cephalochordates, mollusks, cnidarians, ctenophores and sponges).  There is no other meeting that focuses on the comparative development of marine invertebrates and the 24th 'Sea Urchin Meeting' will continue to serve as an important venue for promoting collaborations between scientists working on non-canonical marine invertebrate model systems.  The meeting sessions, which are divided into plenary sessions, concurrent sessions and poster sessions, will highlight experimental findings that contribute to our understanding of how a fertilized egg becomes an embryo with many distinct cell types.  Moreover, there will be sessions that address questions such as how stem cells arise, how animals regenerate lost body parts, and how changes in the marine environment are negatively impacting marine invertebrates.  These questions are of great interest to the public and relevant to human health.  The meeting will promote the participation of junior scientists and the participation of scientists from groups typically underrepresented in the sciences.  In addition, this meeting will have an education session that will promote the use of marine invertebrate embryos in undergraduate teaching of developmental biology and in community outreach.  <br/><br/>Marine invertebrate model systems have made major contributions to our current knowledge of many aspects of biology, including developmental biology. The diversity of marine invertebrate model systems that will be featured at this meeting will provide opportunities to continue the systems level comparisons of development and evolution in phylogenetically informative bilaterian and non-bilaterian taxa.  This meeting will also highlight recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that specify embryonic polarity in oocytes and embryos, mechanisms regulating mitotic patterns, novel ideas on the evolution of nervous systems, gene regulatory network level analyses on morphogenesis, insights into the evolution of stem cells and regeneration, and the ecological and environmental influences on embryonic and larval development.  In addition, there will be a session on application of relevant recently developed techniques (e.g. genome editing) to manipulate development in non-canonical marine invertebrates."

Freshwater mussels are one of the most threatened aquatic organisms in North America, and much work has been conducted to understand and conserve them.  It is hypothesized here that freshwater mussels can survive for relatively long time periods (up to several decades) at a given river location even during high flow events with much sediment in motion.  To do this, mussels may have special adaptations that enable them to remain in place on a river bed during high flow stages.  Field surveys, numerical modeling, and experimental facilities will demonstrate that mussels on river beds can remain in place for relatively long time periods, to show that the forces required to move mussels out of their burrows are higher than expected values, and to illustrate that mussels can alter the flow within a river to aid in their long-term survival.  This work seeks to provide critical information on those processes that enable mussels to thrive in rivers, which then could be used to aid conservation efforts.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in field, experimental, and numerical methods employed in rivers and aquatic ecology, providing them the necessary skills for their future careers.  Lastly, an innovative interdisciplinary research team will be assembled to advance the fundamental understanding of how aquatic organisms interact with river flow.<br/><br/>Freshwater mussels (Unionidae) are one of the most imperiled aquatic organisms in North American rivers and much effort has been expended to understand their precipitous decline.  The current paradigm is that the relative stability (immobility) of river beds over long time periods (decades) is a critical component to the ecological success and resiliency of mussels.  Yet such information is in stark contrast to the central understanding of self-formed rivers.  This research program is designed to examine the fundamental interactions between near-bed turbulent flow and sediment transport within sand- and gravel-bedded rivers with labile beds populated by benthic organisms.  The focus for this study is an imperiled freshwater mussel, which can be considered an ""ecologic engineer.""  It is hypothesized that (1) benthic organisms like freshwater mussels can thrive for relatively long time periods (ca. decades) at-a-station in dynamic, self-made river systems with labile channel beds, and that these same reaches often experience channel-forming discharges, (2) entrainment thresholds for selected live benthic organisms in labile river beds are measurably greater than fully-equivalent non-cohesive sediment particles due to biophysical adaptations (ecological engineering), and (3) the constructive interference of near-bed flow, turbulence, roughness, and ecological engineering adaptations create a hydrodynamic emergent phenomenon, a ""tipping-point,"" that increases the stability of labile river beds at relatively high flow stages.  First, field surveys and numerical modeling will be employed at selected reaches of two streams with historically- and ecologically-significant mussel populations to demonstrate unequivocally the persistence of mussel beds in labile river channels.  Second, laboratory experiments, also supported by numerical modeling, will directly measure the lift and drag forces acting on burrowed mussels, with and without active filtering, to assess entrainment thresholds and near-bed hydrodynamics.  Third, a combined experimental and numerical modeling campaign will quantify the emergence of a hydrodynamic ""tipping-point"" wherein the fluid drag acting on a mussel-covered bed becomes reduced through the constructive interference of variable boundary conditions.  This work seeks to demonstrate that evolutionary adaptations promote hydrodynamic conditions beneficial to the persistence and survival of mussels in rivers."

Smart grid operations, smart transportation, and smart healthcare are just a few such networked operations that are envisioned to help us manage our resources efficiently using smarter interactions among their subsystems. However, optimally benefiting from these networked systems will require efficient operational algorithms, many of which involve in-network static or dynamic optimal decision-making. Effective solutions for such algorithms need to be distributed and implementable within the limitations inherent in communication devices. Furthermore, in many applications, these solutions also must have transparent privacy preservation properties to make them acceptable for everyday use. This proposal's research objective is to investigate how automatic control-theoretic tools can be used to develop and analyze distributed dynamic optimization algorithms that respect the restrictions inherent to communication channels and address concerns regarding privacy preservation of participating agents in smart network operation. The results of this research will facilitate the realization and adoption of optimal in-network solutions in many important cyber-physical applications, such as smart grid, sensor networks, and distributed data regression in the healthcare and banking sectors. This project research will be complemented by a multi-tiered educational, mentoring, and outreach plan to train and motivate the next generation of experts who will solve problems that will emerge  along with the new paradigms of smart networked systems. The research will be integrated into the University of California, Irvine curriculum through three main avenues: (1) developing new graduate and undergraduate courses, (2) involving students in the PI's Cooperative Systems Lab, and (3) mentoring efforts at the college and high school levels.<br/><br/>This project will significantly expand the current state of knowledge on distributed solutions for in-network dynamic optimization algorithm design in three separate directions: design techniques, efficient communication, and transparent privacy preservation characteristics. In terms of design techniques, the proposal will showcase a systematic distributed algorithm design using two time-scale dynamical system concepts from singular perturbation theory. For a robust, active, and smarter communication strategy, event-triggered communication approaches will be used to enable each agent to locally decide when it is necessary to communicate in order to preserve the algorithm's integrity. Finally, to achieve transparent privacy preservation, this project will include development of observability tests to identify a knowledge set that enables eavesdroppers to construct the private data of other agents in the network using sophisticated observers, such as neuro-observers. The project will also include design of solutions for resistance of these intrusions by developing tools and methods to create augmentations that induce privacy preservation in distributed dynamic optimization algorithms."

Yet they are also notoriously difficult to get right, especially in the face of computer and network faults. Previous research efforts have used tools from formal methods, such as theorem provers, to build distributed systems with formally verified correctness guarantees. This project advances the state-of-the-art by attacking the complementary problem of formally verifying performance guarantees for a class of distributed systems representable as games: distributed routers, load balancers, and others. Such performance guarantees are useful in a wide variety of settings, from real-time systems to low-latency web applications. The project additionally supports curricular development at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as activities such as the investigator's ""Coq Bootcamp"", a twice-weekly summer seminar on formal verification for undergraduates.<br/><br/>The investigator's technical methodology combines tools from programming languages, such as domain-specific languages (DSLs) for correct-by-construction programming in Coq, with recent work in algorithmic game theory: Roughgarden?s smooth games and an implementation of games called multiplicative weights. By composing a DSL for smooth games with a verified implementation of multiplicative weights, this project formally bounds the time within which a smooth game converges, and the quality of the resulting state wrt. optimal. To recover guarantees against a network model that permits faults, the project uses a quantified version of the Verdi system's verified system transformers to wrap smooth games in implementations of common distributed design patterns such as sequence numbering."

This project will enhance knowledge about coupled human-ecological relationships, fire ecology, biogeography, and human behavioral ecology.  By employing the conceptual framework of alternative stable states, this project will provide new insights about the potential influence of intentionally set fires and Native American resource use on ecological community dynamics.  The project will assist the Yurok and Karuk tribes as well as the U.S. Forest Service with their efforts to reinstate prescribed fire as a means to improve access to cultural and subsistence resources and reduce wildfire risk, and it will contribute to assessment of the potential utility of employing prescribed fire in other locales.   The project also will provide new perspectives and data regarding the historical characteristics of fire regimes.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Small-scale subsistence groups and land managers worldwide intentionally set prescribed fires to improve accessibility to natural resources, enhance resource abundance and distribution, and reduce the spread of wildfire.  After decades of fire exclusion in North America, efforts to revive the use of prescribed burning face several obstacles, such as restrictions, administrative processes, and financial constraints.  Combined with changing climate and land-use regimes, fire exclusion has altered fire regimes, often leading to increases in wildfire size and intensity.  In some parts of the nation, Native American communities are leading prescribed burning efforts because of their cultural connection and reliance on fire-dependent resources.  The restoration of prescribed fire by Yurok and Karuk tribal members provides an opportunity to test hypotheses related to the use of prescribed fire and ecological community dynamics.  Prescribed fires also help meet multiple tribal objectives, including increasing the availability of hazelnut stems for basketry materials; maintaining savannas for deer and elk forage to improve hunting; and reducing wildfire risk.  The doctoral student conducting this project will compare hazelnut stem densities, deer frequencies, and surface fuel loads in burned plots along with matched plots in unburned areas.  He will evaluate the effects these fire regimes may have on resource access by observing the harvesting trips of tribal members as they search for fire-dependent resources, and he will conduct interviews focusing on fire histories at harvesting sites.  He will establish vegetation plots at these harvesting and prescribed fire locations in order to monitor ecological change at each site, and he will analyze aerial photographs and satellite imagery ranging from 1944 to 2016 to compare historical and contemporary savanna characteristics. Transects will be stratified along remnant savanna borders, recent prescribed burns, and adjacent unburned areas to assess species composition under distinctive fire regimes.  To assess effects on wildfire risk, the student will contrast surface fuel loads between prescribed burn and non-burn areas with wildfire models in those ecological communities."

All HPEs are strongly concentrated into the continental crust. Thus, documenting their concentrations in the crust is essential for any quantitative accounting of heat production within the deeper Earth, but such documentation has proven elusive. This project will seek to develop a method that can be used to quantify the budget of HPEs in the continental crust.<br/><br/>Because the continental crust is highly heterogeneous, and mostly inaccessible, determining the HPE abundances of the crust has often been attempted using surface heat flow data. However, the heat flowing from the Earth?s surface is a combination of heat produced within the crust and heat flowing from the underlying mantle and distinguishing between these two heat sources has been difficult. Our project seeks to determine crustal heat production by placing constraints on the temperature at the Moho - the boundary between the crust and the mantle. To do this, we will analyze minerals that, though widespread, occur in low abundances in most crustal rocks - termed accessory phases. Select accessory phases contain U when they crystallize, but exclude Pb (the ultimate daughter product of U decay). We will extract U-bearing accessory phases from samples of the lower crust that were carried rapidly to the surface in basaltic magmas (xenoliths). Because the temperature at which Pb diffuses in each of the accessory phases varies from one mineral species to the next, we can use the Pb isotope data to determine the temperature at which the xenoliths were sitting prior to their entrainment in the basaltic host lavas. Combined with estimates of the pressure of equilibration of the samples (hence, depth of derivation), and the surface heat flow, we can use our data to determine the HPE content of the continental crust in a given region. This project will serve as a demonstration of feasibility, which, if successful, can be applied to other regions in order to develop a HPE concentration map of the continents."

Through continuous sensing, mobile device services play a large role in personal computing, assistive technology, and many other fields. However deriving expressive input from high data rate sensors currently suffers from fundamental limitations to the efficiency and performance of handling densely pipelined streams of raw data. This is largely because sensor configuration and control in modern mobile systems induces significant system latency, preventing immediate control of sensor operation and limiting algorithmic expressiveness. <br/><br/>This project pursues the transformation of operating system and sensor architecture to provide system support for reactive sensor operation: using a low-level process to observe and react to context, immediately executing developer-defined sensor configuration, sampling, and processing before providing data access at the application layer. This paradigm provides developers with expressive access to sensor operation while maintaining energy-efficiency and high-performance in the mobile system. Thus, the project discerns systems principles to model and design reactive programming abstractions for sensor processing and control through operating system services, system libraries, daemon processes, and sensor system architecture modifications."

Fraternal twinning rates vary across populations, and this variation and the potential adaptive advantages of having twins are not fully understood. Previous research by these investigators and others suggest that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. This project will collect initial information on the scale and timing of twinning in one population with an extremely high twinning rate, which will provide a foundation for subsequent research projects to understand the cultural, biological, evolutionary, and environmental contexts of multiple births in modern humans. The project also supports international research collaborations and may lead to findings that inform fertility research.  <br/><br/>Spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twinning occurs with the release and fertilization of two oocytes. A genetic component to dizygotic twinning has long been recognized, potentially including genes related to follicle cohort size and multiple implantation, but no clear inheritance pattern has been identified. Environmental factors such as smoking may also influence twinning rates. The investigators will collect information on twin occurrence in a village in southern India, to reconstruct when the village started to have twin frequencies that are out of the normal range of other Indian populations, and to begin to explore the potential effects of microevolutionary processes and environmental chemical exposure."

How is an individual's interaction with linguistic variation influenced by the general cognitive strategies used to resolve competition in the environment? In a dual mechanisms framework, cognitive control -- the mechanisms engaged to resolve conflict and regulate expectations -- is divided into two interrelated strategies: proactive and reactive control. Study 1 examines how those control strategies influence individual adaptation to distributional changes in speech input, using an experiment simulating sound change in the laboratory. Less habitual engagement of proactive and reactive control strategies is hypothesized to facilitate the integration of phonological variation. Study 2 then translates the same behavioral tasks to the field in a community-based study examining language variation on a larger scale: sound changes-in-progress (as when 'wait' sounds more like 'wheat'). This dissertation complements existing knowledge regarding sound change in Philadelphia by collecting sociolinguistic interviews of Puerto Rican Philadelphians, one of the largest communities outside of Puerto Rico. Interviews are collected from two age groups and two neighborhood groups based on demographic makeup (proportion of Black and White Philadelphians) to document how one?s immediate community influences participation in three socially-stratified sound changes-in-progress. The same participants then complete the three behavioral tasks from Study 1 (AX-CPT, a modified Stroop paradigm, and an n-back task with lures), permitting a regression analysis of how control strategies modulate their adoption of changes-in-progress.<br/><br/>This is one of the first studies to explicitly link dual mechanisms of cognitive control to language processing. It is unique in applying these strategies both to simulated sound change in the laboratory and real-world sound change in the community, documenting the speech of an understudied population and providing a unified account of how social and cognitive factors interact in language use."

The undergraduate is thus trained in research techniques and is fully incorporated into the graduate group, in many cases undergoing a life changing experience which puts him/her on the path to a career in research. Three quarters of our students enter Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) graduate programs with the almost all others entering medical school, industry, or business. Over the last grant period, approximately one third of our students became co-authors with their advisers on scientific publications, which can be a thrilling experience for an undergraduate. These Research Experience for Undergraduates, REU, activities are an essential and well-documented ingredient in the development of our future leaders in science and engineering. Currently, faculty are drawn from eleven university departments to our Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), almost all of whom can offer summer positions to undergraduates.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>The objective of the proposed REU-Site project is to provide a diverse group of ten STEM undergraduates with hands-on experience in materials research. Student participants are hosted by the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM) at Penn for 10 weeks during the summer. The targeted student participants are gender, racially, and ethnically diverse, with representation from a broad spectrum of colleges throughout the nation, especially minority-serving and small colleges with limited research capabilities. The project introduces students to materials research as a cohesive subject of study. This objective is achieved by incorporating the student participants into active research groups of faculty affiliated with the LRSM and engaging them at the cutting edge of interdisciplinary materials research. The stimulating intellectual environment provided by LRSM research, facilities, and community, inspires and nurtures student participants, thereby fostering a STEM trajectory. Current research projects include topics ranging from ""microfluidic-based rheology of complex fluids"" and ""self assembly of hydrogels"" to ?""hemo-mechanical-sensing"" and ""interaction and assembly in soft materials.?""Students also receive a series of lectures on research ethics, laboratory safety, and the fundamentals of materials science. The LRSM, which is host to a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), oversees the requested REU-Site project. The breadth of materials topics covered in the LRSM research portfolio enable students from different disciplines and diverse backgrounds to interact and appreciate the application of materials research to engineering, medicine, industry, and commerce."

In coming years, the frequency and intensity of coastal flooding are anticipated to increase because of rising sea levels and amplified storm severity.  While there have been numerous studies of decision-making around temporary evacuation, surprisingly little is known about how people decide whether and when to leave permanently.  Ephemeral data collect by this project will be used to understand the factors that affect how people make migration decisions.  Findings from this research will be of use to city and regional  planners and local and state governments as they prepare for the outcomes of future disasters.  Therefore, a University of Georgia team composed of architect Brian Orland and anthropologist Meredith Welch-Devine will take advantage of the recent occurrence of Hurricane Mathew to learn more about how extreme events affect relocation intentions.<br/> <br/>The researchers will focus their investigation on the Georgia coast. Hurricane Matthew's impact on the Georgia coastline offers an unusual opportunity to investigate how residents experienced the storm and how that experience affected thinking about future migration. The storm passed the Georgia coast at low-tide so the resulting surge was particularly revealing of where the future impacts of projected sea level rise and future storms would likely occur.  Residents now understand who will be impacted and how severely by future storm events. Because most residents eventually were able to return their homes, they comprise an ideal population from which to collect baseline data for longitudinal research.  The researchers will survey coastal residents about their beliefs and attitudes toward climate change, sea-level rise, storm events, and emergency preparedness. The survey data will be complemented by in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of residents stratified by social and economic status. The data will also be used as a baseline for future post-storm research in the area, as well as by social scientists seeking to improve theories of what factors most affect people's relocation choices after extreme events."

This 5-year CAREER project will study disease prevalence and intensity in two marine foundation species - the seagrass Zostera marina and the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. More specifically, host-disease relationships will be explored to understand how genetic diversity and population density of the host species impacts disease transmission and risk. This work will pair large-scale experimental restorations and smaller-scale field experiments to examine disease-host relationships across multiple spatial scales. Comparisons of patterns and mechanisms across the two coastal systems will provide an important first step towards identifying generalities in the diversity-density-disease relationship. To enhance the broader impacts and utility of this work, the experiments will be conducted in collaboration with restoration practitioners and guided by knowledge ascertained from key stakeholder groups. The project will support the development of an early career female researcher and multiple graduate and undergraduate students. Students will be trained in state-of-the-art molecular techniques to quantify oyster and seagrass parasites. Key findings from the surveys and experimental work will be incorporated into undergraduate courses focused on Conservation Biology, Marine Biology, and Disease Ecology. Finally, students in these courses will help develop social-ecological surveys and mutual learning games to stimulate knowledge transfer with stakeholders through a series of workshops.<br/><br/>The relationship between host genetic diversity and disease dynamics is complex.  In some cases, known as a dilution effect, diversity reduces disease transmission and risk. However, the opposite relationship, known as the amplification effect, can also occur when diversity increases the risk of infection. Even if diversity directly reduces disease risk, simultaneous positive effects of diversity on host density could lead to amplification by increasing disease transmission between infected and uninfected individuals. Large-scale field restorations of seagrasses (Zostera marina) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica) will be utilized to test the effects of host genetic diversity on host population density and disease prevalence/intensity. Additional field experiments independently manipulating host genetic diversity and density will examine the mechanisms leading to dilution or amplification. Conducting similar manipulations in two marine foundation species - one a clonal plant and the other a non-clonal animal - will help identify commonalities in the diversity-density-disease relationship. Further, collaborations among project scientists, students, and stakeholders will enhance interdisciplinary training and help facilitate the exchange of information to improve management and restoration efforts. As part of these efforts, targeted surveys will be used to document the perceptions and attitudes of managers and restoration practitioners regarding genetic diversity and its role in ecological resilience and restoration."

What determines which of these two differing modes of behavior dominates remains a key problem in landslide mechanics and natural hazard prediction.  This project will investigate the physical processes that are thought to govern slow slip in landslides.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will test two hypotheses for feedbacks between landslide deformation and groundwater flow at a large, active, slow-moving landslide (Oak Ridge earthflow) near San Jose, CA. The first hypothesis argues that sliding along a landslide's margins causes changes in permeability that will lead both to retention of water and to patterns of groundwater flow that will encourage future failure in one location.  The second hypothesis argues that sliding induces expansion of soil pore spaces in slow moving landslides, which reduces water pressure inside the slide and hence stabilizes basal sliding.  Both of these hypotheses suggest feedbacks on sliding that are fundamental to the process of landslide failure. Although each hypothesis rests on a sound physical and experimental basis, only very limited field data exist to test each."

For applications involving mobile devices, sensor networks, or biomedical implants, the storage available is limited and is a precious resource. This project aims to advance our understanding of the trade-offs between the amount of storage and the amount of data required for statistical tasks by (i) designing efficient algorithms that require small space and (ii) establishing fundamental limits on the storage required for these tasks. The research is at the intersection of streaming algorithms, which is primarily concerned with storage requirements of algorithmic problems, and statistical learning, which studies data requirements for statistical tasks. <br/><br/>The investigators formulate basic statistical problems under storage constraints. The specific questions include entropy estimation of discrete distributions, a canonical problem that researchers from various fields including statistics, information theory, and computer science have studied. The paradigm of interest is the following: while the known sample-efficient entropy estimation algorithms require a lot of storage, it might be possible to reduce the storage requirements drastically by taking a little more than the optimal number of samples. The complementary side of the problem is purely information theoretic. In it, the researchers expect to develop general lower bounds that can be used to prove fundamental limits on the storage-sample trade-offs."

Compositional variations in different portions of Earth's mantle inferred from variations in magma composition also provide insights into how processes such as plate tectonics and mantle convection have shaped the long-term evolution of Earth's interior, which ultimately also influences the evolution of Earth's surface environment and life itself. However, magma storage, mixing, and interaction with crustal rocks can affect the compositions of magmas before they erupt at the surface. These processes can also influence whether volcanic eruptions are explosive or not, and thus influence volcanic hazards. This project will study the compositions of crystalline aggregates (or cumulates) brought to the surface by erupting lava flows in Hawaii. These cumulates are probably formed at depth within Hawaiian magma is stored temporarily and are later were carried to the surface by Hawaiian magmas. The compositions of these crystalline cumulates provide a record of the depths of magma storage and processes such as magma cooling and crystallization, mixing of discrete magma batches, and assimilation of the surrounding rock during magma ascent. The results of this study will provide a better understanding of the so-called ""plumbing system"" of Hawaiian volcanoes, allow us to better interpret the compositional observed in erupted lavas, and may help us explain why many Hawaiian volcanoes appear to alternate between periods of non-explosive eruptions (low volcanic hazard) and explosive eruptions (much higher volcanic hazard). Results of this research will be incorporated into outreach lectures and exhibits, specifically the ""Hot Science Cool Talks"" program and the annual ""Explore University of Texas"" open house, both of which draw a large number of local elementary-, middle- and high-school-age children to the institution. This project will also support the training and development of both graduate and undergraduate students, preparing them for careers in the Geologic Sciences.<br/><br/>This project will examine geochemical variations in xenoliths hosted in recent post-shield-stage lavas from Hualalai and Mauna Kea volcanoes. These plutonic samples, which include rare fragments of Pacific oceanic crust as well as cumulates of Hawaiian shield- and post-shield magmas, provide powerful constraints on the temporal evolution and spatial variation of Hawaiian magma storage and transport systems, and will allow us to evaluate the potential roles of melt/lithosphere, melt/crust, and melt/edifice interaction in generating chemical and isotopic signatures (or scatter) in Hawaiian lavas. Mineral major element compositions and petrologic modeling will be combined with supporting trace element, radiogenic (Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf-Os) and stable O isotope data to constrain the nature of parental magmas (shield tholeiities or post-shield alkali basalts) that produced different xenolith populations, and the depths at which these magmas ponded and fractionated. This will provide a 4-D picture of how Hawaiian magmatic plumbing evolves over time, and whether it varies between Kea- and Loa-trend volcanoes. Integration of isotopic and trace element data with mineral major element data will allow us to examine how both the overall isotopic compositions and isotopic variability in Hawaiian xenoliths varies as a function of formation depth, degree of melt fractionation, or volcanic stage. Specific questions to be addressed including 1) Over what range of depths do Hawaiian magmas pond and fractionate? Does magma storage depth vary significantly from volcano to volcano (e.g., between Kea-trend and Loa-trend volcanoes) or within individual volcanoes during different stages of volcanism (e.g., shield and post-shield volcanism)? 2) To what extent does crustal assimilation, melt/lithosphere interaction, or ""self assimilation"" within the volcanic edifice affect the final compositions of Hawaiian lavas, and how does this vary between Hawaiian shield-stage, post-shield-stage, and rejuvenation-stage lavas? 3) What role does magma mixing and homogenization play in damping small-scale heterogeneities from discrete melt batches? Can plutonic xenoliths provide additional insight into the nature and length-scales of Hawaiian plume heterogeneities This research is expected to contribute significantly to our understanding of Hawaiian magma storage, mixing, and assimilation processes."

The wettest region in the eastern continental US, the southern mountain region and its aquatic resources are a natural laboratory and classroom, and an ideal setting for learning about how watersheds and river systems function ecologically and respond to environmental changes. <br/><br/>This project aims to reconfigure, update, and expand the HBS Aquatics Laboratory by (1) modernizing the lab infrastructure by upgrading outdated electrical, lighting, HVAC, insulation, and plumbing; (2) rearranging and replumbing existing research tanks and artificial streams; (3) expanding the research lab to provide bench space, restroom, and accommodate upgraded research equipment; and (4) reorganizing and upgrading the adjacent exterior space by replumbing outdoor artificial streams and creating storage for field equipment. The upgraded HBS Aquatics Laboratory will support a greater breadth of controlled laboratory and field studies of regional riverine and stream system ecology, improving the scientific understanding of these systems and thus providing the information needed to inform planning, management, and mitigation. Expansion of the facility is also designed to dovetail with the growing public education and enrichment activities at HBS, introducing K-12 students and life-long learners to the equipment and methodologies of aquatic sciences."

In this proposal, we leverage the unique properties of emerging nanotechnologies to realize both energy-efficient devices as well as novel energy-efficient computing system architectures that are not possible to realize with today's silicon-based systems. This work forms the foundation to build and test hardware prototypes of next-generation IoT computing systems that are radically different than today's systems, encompassing both new technologies and new system architectures.<br/><br/>The technical objectives are to use emerging nanotechnologies for logic (1D and 2D nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes) and memory (non-volatile memories, such as RRAM) to realize monolithic three-dimensional integrated circuits targeting IoT applications. Initial work focuses on addressing the feasibility of realizing these future systems, by developing combined processing and circuit design techniques to overcome the major challenges of imperfections inherent in these emerging nanotechnologies. Simultaneously, the large architectural design space for monolithic three-dimensional integrated circuits is being explored, optimized for IoT applications. This architectural design space includes the emerging nanotechnologies that are simultaneously being developed. Due to these advances, we are designing and fabricating the first hardware demonstration of a future IoT system leveraging emerging nanotechnologies."

Distributed systems are widely used in increasingly important applications ranging from finance to aircraft control to gain fault-tolerance, throughput and responsiveness. Unfortunately, they are notoriously complicated and prone to bugs. Nodes may not only crash but also be hacked and controlled by malicious agents. The so-called Byzantine nodes can impersonate other nodes or send confusing messages. Formal security guarantees of Byzantine fault-tolerant systems have not been specified and verified yet. This project undertakes research leading to such guarantees through a novel programming, verification and runtime framework. The intellectual merits of the project are fundamental advances in the semantics of networks and representation, composition, and proof methodologies for distributed systems. The project's broader significance is a publicly available open-source library of certified distributed systems that can lead to faster evolution of secure and trustworthy distributed systems.<br/><br/>This project includes the following key components: (1) Precise representation and composition of layers of distributed implementations. An event-based model represents and composes layers of distributed implementations. An implementation is programmed and verified modularly against the specification of the lower-level implementation. (2) The semantics of the Byzantine synchronous network and the specifications of implementations. This project presents a novel operational semantics for Byzantine synchronous networks that is parametric in terms of the implementation. Hence, the safety and liveness specification of an implementation can be stated as conditions on the external traces of the semantics when instantiated with the implementation. (3) Proof principles for the Byzantine semantics and proof automation. This research develops proof principles for the semantics that abstract the common parts of the proofs and facilitate proof automation. To automate the proofs, this project searches for decision and semi-decision procedures for the proof obligations of the principles.

This study is important because of persistent disinterest by secondary students in mathematics in the United States. This study will examine how high school teachers can design lessons so that mathematical content itself is the source of student intrigue, pursuit, and passion. To do this, the content within mathematical lessons (both planned and enacted) is framed as mathematical stories and the felt tension between how information is revealed and withheld from students as the mathematical story unfolds is framed as its mathematical plot. The Mathematical Story Framework (Dietiker, 2013, 2015) foregrounds both the coherence (does the story make sense?) and aesthetic (does it stimulate anticipation for what is to come, and if so, how?) dimensions of mathematics lessons. The project will generate principles for lesson design usable by teachers in other settings and exemplar lessons that can be shared. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project draws from prior curriculum research and design to (a) develop a theory of teacher MCLE design and enactment with the Mathematical Story Framework, (b) increase the understanding(s) of the aesthetic nature of mathematics curriculum by both researchers and teachers, and (c) generate detailed MCLE exemplars that demonstrate curricular coherence, cognitive demand, and aesthetic dimensions of mathematical lessons. The project is grounded in a design-based research framework for education research. A team of experienced high school teachers will design and test MCLEs (four per teacher) with researchers through three year-long cycles. Prior to the first cycle, data will be collected (interview, observations) to record initial teacher curricular strategies regarding student dispositions toward mathematics. Then, a professional development experience will introduce the Mathematical Story Framework, along with other curricular frameworks to support the planning and enacting of lessons (i.e., cognitive demand and coherence). During the design cycles, videotaped observations and student aesthetic measures (surveys and interviews) for both MCLEs and a non-MCLEs (randomly selected to be the lesson before or after the MCLE) will be collected to enable comparison. Also, student dispositional measures, collected at the beginning and end of each cycle, will be used to learn whether and how student attitudes in mathematics change over time. Of the MCLEs designed and tested, a sample will be selected (based on aesthetic and mathematical differences) and developed into models, complete with the rationale for and description of aesthetic dimensions."

When people cooperate successfully, everyone on the team comes together to achieve a goal while being fair to the entire team. Successful cooperation ideally includes achieving the good of each person on the team, as well. To sustain successful cooperation, people need to coordinate what they see, hear, think, and do, especially about who is in the best position at any given moment to make the best decision or to take the best action for the team as a whole. Expertise changes with changing circumstances, and team members need to respond quickly and flexibly. This project will enhance understanding about how the mind and brain work to initiate and sustain successful cooperation in a rapidly changing world. The research will reveal aspects of the mind and brain that best support winning strategies for cooperative success. It will combine computational models of team coordination with measurements and models of brain networks during successful cooperation. The outcomes of the research could help enhance innovation in teams for technology design, assist centers of disease control to contain sudden outbreaks, and create new methods to help robotic assistants better respond to human direction.<br/><br/>The research proposal seeks to answer the following primary questions: 1) What is a team member's mental representation of other agents with whom that person is cooperating, especially during periods of cooperative success?; 2) How do these representations contribute to knowledge of others' decision-making processes and changing expertise?; and 3) What are the neural signals that predict cognitive updating and successful cooperative action? To model the cognitive processes during cooperation requires explicitly modeling social reasoning capabilities, especially capacities to think about other partners's decision process and their sophistication in understanding both the task and communication among team members. These features cannot be observed directly and will be estimated using computational approaches for multi-agent settings (i.e., interactive partially observable Markov decision processes). The underlying neural networks will emerge via dense array EEG and analysis of functional connectivity patterns within and across brains. Network connectivity measures include the circular correlation coefficient and time-varying, adaptive multivariate autogressive modeling, using independent components that covary strongly with choice outcomes and/or cognitively modeled parameters. These measures of between-brain connectivity are less susceptible to spurious correlations induced by underlying task demands.

In this project, the PI and his team will develop self-immolative polymer coatings that exert on-contact bactericidal activity and undergo triggered depolymerization specifically in response to enzymatic activity expressed extracellularly within the biofilm matrix. The students will synthesize functionalized poly(benzyl ether)s containing bactericidal cationic side chains and enzyme-labile end groups. Surfaces coatings composed of these new materials will be screened for bactericidal activity, toxicity to human cells, and their degradation response to a range of biofilm-associated enzymatic stimuli. In the final stage, surface coatings will be evaluated for their effectiveness in prevented biofilm formation both in the laboratory-grown and environmental settings. Students will be trained in a highly multidisciplinary environment encompassing synthetic polymer chemistry, biophysics, and materials science. They will pave the way for new avenues in biomimetic materials science, deepen our understanding of the materials-microbe interface, and generate prototype technologies of enormous commercial and industrial importance.

This extreme warming event is termed as ""Ningaloo Nio"", an analogy to other eastern continental boundary warming phenomena such as El Nio in the Pacific and the Benguela Nio in the Atlantic. During the recent Ningaloo Nio event, SSTs off the west coast of Australia were more than 5 degree centigrade above long-term seasonal means, which is sufficient to impact large-scale atmospheric circulation and has devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and resources. In this region, locally and remotely forced ocean circulations in the southeast Indian Ocean, such as Leeuwin current system, may play a crucial role in the development of the Ningaloo Nio event. The primary goal of this proposed project is to understand physical processes that control the development of Ningaloo Nio/Nia. The proposed project will contribute to the plan and design of major international field campaigns and improving observational network in the Indian Ocean, enhancing education through supporting students and a post-doc, and advancing climate prediction. One of the PIs' institutions is recognized as a Hispanic Serving Institution by the U.S. Department of Education, and thus the project will contribute to providing training opportunities for underrepresented minorities. In addition, the proposed research will identify key processes that must be represented well in climate models, which will help improve climate model simulation and benefit society by providing more reliable climate prediction. <br/><br/>A variety of oceanic processes that affect the 'Ningaloo Nio' will be explored in the proposed study including: 1) The impact of the remote forcing from the Pacific Ocean versus forcing over the Indian Ocean on the Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo Nio/Nia;  2) Effects of topographic trapping of westward radiating Rossby waves and their associated downwelling/upwelling associated with Ningaloo Nio/Nia events; 3) The influence of the MJO on Leeuwin current and Ningaloo Nio/Nia via oceanic processes; 4) The role of Australian summer monsoon in affecting the Ningaloo Nio/Nia events. A high-resolution Indo-Pacific basin ocean general circulation model (OGCM) will be employed, which can adequately represent complex bathymetry and topography in the Indonesian Seas. The data from enhanced in-situ observations and satellite data will be thoroughly analyzed and maximally utilized to validate the model. A series of process-oriented OGCM experiments will be performed, to quantify the impacts of remote & local forcing on the Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo/Nio, and identify key processes involved, including the role of coastal Kelvin waves and radiation of Rossby waves. The results will identify the physical processes that determine the sea surface temperature and upper-ocean variability associated with Ningaloo Nio, which can alter atmospheric circulations. In particular, the impacts of Madden-Julian oscillation and the remote forcing from the Pacific on the Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo Nio, which cannot be isolated by observations alone, will be quantified by a series of OGCM experiments. Consequently, completion of the proposed project will substantially advance our understanding of the dynamics of Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo Nio that is major climate variability in the southeast Indian Ocean."

This dissertation project will develop more accurate methods for determining the developmental age of mice during embryogenesis and investigate changes in developmental timing that may have driven the evolution of anatomical features that separate modern humans from their closest relatives and ancestors. The age estimation methodology produced by this research will be integrated into a freely available, online staging tool. Research conducted within the scope of this project will also help to create opportunities for female undergraduate and high school students to gain valuable experience in data collection and analysis, and to present original research at local and national symposia.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research is to address long-standing questions about how changes in the timing of development, either in the rate, the onset time, or the offset time of the development of specific anatomical features during embryogenesis, affect adult morphology. Experimental systems provide a potentially illuminating context to address these questions, but the inability to estimate the relative developmental age of an embryo with precise temporal resolution remains a significant problem. This project will establish a staging system that will precisely estimate the relative development of an embryo in hours, an order of magnitude more precise than existing developmental staging systems. The method, which will estimate developmental ages between embryonic day 9 and embryonic day 15 (E9-E15) using only a photograph of the mouse hindlimb, represents an easy-to-implement tool that mitigates interobserver error. The staging system will then be used to determine the extent to which human-specific anatomy, such as the reduced projection of the face, is produced by a shift in developmental timing, by studying the rate and timing of developmental events in mice carrying mutations that simulate changes in facial anatomy that occurred in human evolution. The results of this research will provide valuable and necessary clarification of the relationships among genotype, phenotype, and timing of developmental events, producing innovative solutions to questions about the nature of human development."

Although such sensors usually have wireless data communication capability, transmitting raw sensed data is usually not an option because of limited battery power, since in a wireless sensor the radio communication power is usually much higher than the signal processing power. Therefore, intelligent sensors need to be capable of providing preprocessing of raw data based on signal processing algorithms and sending only the processed results. Another inevitable challenge in biomedical applications is oversampling. This is because the targeted biomedical signals usually have a wide fractional bandwidth in the frequency spectrum, and require time-frequency analysis. Therefore, in these applications, the Analog to Digital Convertor (ADC) have to apply oversampling in order to avoid the signal distortion introduced by anti-aliasing filters due to the trade-off between fast roll-off and flat group delay. The requirements of both oversampling and the higher resolution also exacerbate the power problem. One promising solution to the above challenges is Delta-Sigma technology. The research objective of this CAREER proposal is to apply Delta-Sigma based Integrated Circuit (IC) design in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to solve circuit power and area problems for the next-generation of low-power intelligent sensors. The proposed research will have a broad impact on next-generation pervasive computing and ubiquitous sensing applications. The educational objectives of this CAREER proposal are promoting active, inquiry-based learning, introducing students to interdisciplinary study and research, and preparing them to meet the future expectations of both academia and industry by providing them a complete skill set including system design, assembly, verification, and optimization, and making cutting-edge research projects more accessible to minority and underrepresented groups of students.<br/><br/>The proposed integrated linear signal processing circuits are based on Delta-Sigma re-modulation using digital Delta-Sigma modulators. Delta Sigma linear processing circuits such as adders, coefficient multipliers, and filters will be designed, fabricated, characterized, and compared to conventional signal processing systems. In particular, based on the preliminary results, the research will target a biomedical signal processor applying the Cross-Frequency-Coupling (CFC) algorithm, which includes designing of FIR and IIR Band-pass filters, Hilbert filters, and Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) circuits. The proposed system with reconfigurable resolution will be investigated in order to evaluate the benefit of introducing adaptive resolution sensors to save sensing and communication power. The proposed research significantly advances the state-of-the-art in integrated intelligent sensors by employing ideas from Delta-Sigma Modulation (DSM), Digital Signal Processing, and Integrated Circuits design in a cross-disciplinary fashion.  Specifically, the proposed research will lead to a highly power-efficient circuit and system architecture by addressing the following objectives: 1) studying design and properties of Delta-Sigma based adders and coefficient multipliers for a theoretical understanding of how they can be applied to various circuit architectures, 2) investigating Delta-Sigma based digital filters and neural network systems and exploring the feasibility of applying the proposed circuits in machine learning, and 3) developing an integrated circuit of Cross-Frequency-Coupling algorithm for electroencephalograph (EEG) signal processing using Delta-Sigma digital signal processing circuits, and evaluating the system performance compared with conventional architecture."

Project findings will serve as a resource for scientists interested in not only primate evolution, but also for understanding what locomotor behaviors can tell us about changing paleoenvironments. Some of the extinct species that will be included in this project are from sites that also contain early human fossils, providing an opportunity to examine environments in which early humans evolved. This study will provide undergraduate training opportunities in both data collection and project development, through the Primate Osteology and Primate Morphometrics Laboratories at the University of Oregon. Many of the extant colobine species are listed as either threatened or endangered, and this research will support primate conservation efforts.  <br/><br/>Studies of human evolution have focused on the effects of climatic and broad environmental change on species diversity. In this project, the investigator will focus on the effects of inter-specific interactions and competition during primate and human evolution. The aims of this project are to describe for the first time sets of associated colobine postcranial remains, to describe the functional morphology of these remains, and to assess the diversity of these and other fossil species in an ecological context, with an emphasis on the role of niche partitioning in colobine evolution. Both extant and fossil specimens will be described qualitatively and quantitatively. The quantitative portion will include skeletal measurements that are either standard for postcranial description or have been suggested to be functionally relevant in previous studies. The qualitative descriptions will be performed in more detail on the fossil specimens, particularly on those that have not yet been described. These data will be analyzed with respect to phylogenetic relationships, diet and body mass, and other ecologically relevant variables."

While for many years RNA was believed to have only three major roles in the cell, it is now known that the roles adopted by RNA are much broader and interesting.  MicroRNAs are a class of evolutionarily conserved, small noncoding RNAs. They regulate more than 60% of all protein genes, and serve as critical regulators in all biological processes. Due to their central role in gene regulation, microRNAs themselves are tightly regulated. This project will investigate how conformational dynamics in two distinct microRNAs control recognition of specific protein cofactors to regulate their processing pathways. Results of this project will provide important mechanistic insights into the regulation of these essential gene regulators. This project will expand the current knowledge of RNA-protein interactions and deepen the understanding of the functional roles of RNA conformational dynamics in biology. Research and education will be integrated in this project to support scientific training and education of undergraduate and graduate students as well as underrepresented high-school students in STEM principles. An on-campus program will be developed for high-school students featuring an annual scientific forum and summer research internships. Outreach activities to local high schools will be carried out to develop innovative STEM teaching approaches.<br/><br/>MicroRNA biogenesis is a dynamic and regulated process. During the canonical biogenesis pathway, the apical-loop regions of primary and precursor microRNAs play critical regulatory roles. However, these RNA elements are highly flexible and have evaded high-resolution structural study by conventional structural biology techniques. Recent developments in nucleic acid NMR spectroscopy, including those from the PI, have opened new avenues to characterize complex conformational dynamics and transitions in highly flexible RNAs. This project will further develop and apply these NMR methods, together with biochemical and computational approaches, to understand the mechanism by which microRNA biogenesis is regulated via specific RNA-protein interactions. Using microRNA-1 and microRNA-21 as model systems, this project will visualize RNA conformational dynamics in microRNA precursors and elucidate the structural and molecular basis for the regulatory roles of protein cofactors in microRNA biogenesis. Results will be used to evaluate the central hypothesis of this project that the apical-loop regions of primary and precursor microRNAs dynamically sample distinct conformations for protein recognition and that these dynamics may be tuned to affect protein-RNA interactions to direct biogenesis pathways."

It is also one of the only brain structures that maintains the ability to generate new neurons throughout one's lifetime, a feature necessary for effective long-term memory. This project will investigate the origins of human memory by comparing the hippocampus of humans to those of our closest living non-human primate relatives at the levels of neuroanatomy, gene expression, and genetics. This research will provide novel insights into the neurobiological basis of certain human-specific memory-related abilities and the ecological factors that may have driven their emergence. Furthermore, this project will identify neurobiological targets that may render humans uniquely susceptible to certain neurological diseases and disorders known to affect the hippocampus (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Autism spectrum disorder). Data from this project may inform further research and discoveries on human brain form and function. The project will support undergraduate mentoring and research experiences, and the investigators will engage in public science outreach to promote understanding of neuroscience, genetics and human evolution.<br/><br/>While the hippocampus is central to long-term memory in all mammals, only in humans is it known to additionally mediate episodic memory, the capacity to recall specific personal experiences and imagine future events. This may have first emerged in our hominin ancestors to meet the demands of increasingly challenging environments, expanded home ranges, and novel hunting/foraging strategies. Recent evidence suggests that the human whole-hippocampus has become evolutionarily specialized compared to those of other primates in terms of relative size, neuronal structure and distribution, and gene expression. However it is well known that the hippocampus is composed of molecularly and functionally distinct subfields. This project will therefore investigate the evolution of the hippocampus in humans and non-human primates in terms of neuroanatomy, gene expression, and genotype. Volumetric proportions of hippocampal subfields and degree of adult hippocampal neurogenesis will be estimated, and ecological variables will be correlated with neuroanatomical measures to test for neuroecological relationships. Whole-transcriptome gene expression data of hippocampal subfields will be generated and used to identify genes that are differentially expressed in humans. Protein-coding and regulatory regions of genes will be tested for positive selection."

This was the second largest seismic event since the European settlement in New Zealand, and it triggered deep and shallow slow-slip events along the Hikurangi subduction zone. The ongoing slow-slip events have apparently increased the probability of an M~8 megathrust earthquake in this region. Hence, this network can provide useful information on how slow-slip and tremor evolves on the megathrust following a large earthquake. This project involves international collaborations among United States, New Zealand and China, and will support a junior faculty member at UC Riverside.<br/><br/>Four mini-arrays (each has 12 5-s flex-nodes) together with 17 short-period and broadband seismometers, will be deployed around the Cook Strait for up to one year. This hybrid network is strategically planned to complement and take advantage of the existing and planned deployment in the area to be able to have high-resolution locations of seismic events in the region. Seismic data collected during this experiment will be made available to IRIS DMC as soon as the experiment is finished. The collected seismic data can be used to understand the relationship among the M7.8 Kaikoura mainshock, ongoing afterslip, triggered slow-slip events and the accompanying tremor activities, and quantify the physical mechanisms for tremor and microseismicity."

Yet, safely detecting hidden objects remains a major challenge facing fully autonomous driving. Sensors on an autonomous car today, such as cameras and laser range finders, can only detect objects in their direct field-of-view. As a result, they are blind to objects that are hidden due to occlusions or inclement weather. This proposal aims to use wireless communication to overcome this challenge and complement sensors on autonomous vehicles. It relies on the fact that wireless signals, unlike visible light, can penetrate through walls and obstacles. The proposal presents novel system for commodity wireless radios that detects and locates objects around an autonomous vehicle. It does so by developing algorithms that analyze the components of wireless signals that reflect off different objects in the environment. It studies the observed signal values across frequency to discover the material that the obstacles are made of. This allows the system to distinguish between, say, a hidden pedestrian and a hidden car, which should elicit different responses from the driverless car.<br/><br/>The proposed research investigates a novel framework to sense the location and material of obstacles in the vicinity of autonomous vehicles in both indoor and outdoor settings. It will develop an end-to-end system to process wireless signals on commodity wireless radios on autonomous vehicles that can readily be integrated with autonomous path planning systems. Its key intellectual contributions include: (1) A novel method to synchronize commodity Wi-Fi/DSRC radios on vehicular platforms to emulate large antenna arrays with wide bandwidth; (2) A mechanism to use this information to locate the spatial direction and range of surrounding objects; (3) An algorithm to discover the material of objects of interest by studying signals reflected off them across frequencies. The system will be fully validated indoors and outdoors on robotic and vehicular platforms.  The proposed research tackles a fundamental limitation of autonomous vehicles: they cannot view objects occluded from view. Its impact on the safety of driving is potentially transformative given the annual 800,000+ blind-spot related accidents in the U.S. alone. Curriculum for a new graduate course on wireless networks at Carnegie Mellon will incorporate the findings of this research. Hands-on wireless labs will be developed as a part of the Spark Saturday outreach program for high school students in the Pittsburgh area. The proposed research will be disseminated via peer-reviewed conferences, workshops and journals."

In error correcting codes, ""locality"" refers to several ways of quantifying how easily a small amount of information can be recovered from encoded data.   Notions of locality have been around almost as long as coding theory itself, and today the study of locality in error correcting codes is fundamental to applications ranging from the very theoretical (complexity theory) to the very practical (distributed storage schemes).  This research improves our basic scientific understanding of locality, and in doing so it makes progress on these applications.  Beyond its scientific impact, this project has broader educational impact, through the development of course materials and by providing opportunities for graduate and undergraduate research.<br/><br/>The approach of this research is to bridge a gap between two different bodies of literature.  In Theoretical Computer Science, Locally Decodable and Locally Correctable Codes have been studied for over 15 years, and have been linked to many fundamental problems in complexity theory and cryptography. In the past five years, the study of locality has also taken off in distributed storage, in the form of Locally Recoverable Codes and related notions.  These two lines of research operate in different parameter regimes and are motivated by different applications. The current research ties the two together by studying intermediate parameter regimes, and explores the fundamental mathematical trade-offs surrounding locality.  By extending our understanding of locality in coding theory, this research can make progress on important problems in coding, complexity theory, cryptography, and distributed storage; it also develops a theory which could find many more applications going forward."

It supports a study of Body Worn Cameras (BWCs). Specifically, the investigators propose a research agenda to investigate and address three main questions: (1) How do BWCs impact the practice of police work at the individual police officer level? (2) How do BWCs impact the practice of police work at the organizational level? (3) Are these changes emergent or embodied in the practice of police work? To address three questions, the investigators will use a multi-method research design separated into two phases. The results from the two phases will form the basis of the student's PhD dissertation. These results will be shared with the police and broader community through direct meetings and seminars held at UC Denver and the partnering police departments. The findings of this research project will also be disseminated through leading academic journals and conferences in the areas of information systems, institutional studies and organization science. In addition, this project will support the doctoral dissertation of a minority student from a population underrepresented in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Technical Summary    <br/><br/>The research project has two phases. In Phase I, the investigators will examine the adoption of BWCs in up to 10 case sites, through in-depth interviews, ride-along observations of police-civilian interactions, and review of policy documents and internal statistics at municipal police departments in Colorado. Analysis of that data will help make preliminary generalizations of recurring concepts in the data. Drawing on the results of these qualitative data, the investigators will conduct a Delphi study (Phase II) to gather feedback from domain experts and converge on a consensus on case findings and constructs identified in Phase I. With regards to theoretical framing, Information systems theory will be integrated with organizational research in order to provide a more robust explanation of the impact of video technology on policing. The research will inform key discussions, such as the resistance of policing organizations to efforts to increase their accountability and transparency, as well as current trends towards third-party policing via the extension of monitoring activities to camera vendors and digital storage space providers."

Measures describing students, courses, parents, teachers, and schools enable a nuanced consideration of STEM potential and potential confounders. Data will be analyzed using factor analysis, decomposition analysis, multilevel modeling, and propensity score matching.

Findings will be disseminated to aid organizations involved in disaster recovery efforts. Reports would offer practitioners and researchers of humanitarian aid/ disaster response a model for a more robust assessment tool that leverages local resilience, particularly the sharing relationships and institutions. The research also fosters international collaboration among scientists, broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences, and will train undergraduate and graduate students in methods of anthropological data collection and analysis.<br/><br/>Dr. Mark Schuller of Northern Illinois University will explore recovery efforts in Haiti, where Hurricane Matthew caused the largest loss of life and infrastructural damage. The devastation is still being assessed, however the material costs, particularly in the South and Grand'Anse provinces, is quite significant: over 80 percent of structures were severely damaged or destroyed, trees were either felled or stripped of foliage, including staple crops such as breadfruit, and the season's ground crops were also destroyed, along with many irrigation systems. With a team of researchers from the Facult d'Ethnologie, the State University of Haiti, the PI will developing a sampling frame to identify existing and emergency leaders and agencies, and through a range of ethnographic data collection and analysis tools, explore to what extent sociocultural variables, such as solidarity ties, moral and ethical systems that emphasize values such as sharing, and perspectival diversity among various organizations and entities, are influencing recovery efforts. This research offers a timely, unique, and an urgently-needed opportunity to quickly assess the sociocultural ideologies, belief systems, practices and institutions that are central to the rebuilding effort, offering a clear, early case study with which to evaluate theories of resilience and the relief-to-development continuum, particularly the transition from ""emergency"" phase to ""reconstruction."" Communities' own actions and assessments are often missing from these assessments.

FSO communication, especially for wireless networks, can be very low cost in nature for the bandwidth delivered. However, in spite of such obvious advantages, FSO links are rarely used in mobile wireless networks. This award seeks to investigate the leading cause of this phenomenon, namely the high beam alignment delay which poses a major roadblock to the deployment of FSO in mobile networks. Several innovative solutions will be explored in this project: the use of state of the art programmable optical elements that can split the beam into arbitrary patterns and help align the beams quicker, networking protocols that leverage this new capability in order to send data faster, and a novel low cost hardware platform that implements these techniques. Results from this work can improve the performance of the wireless backhaul solutions which is expected to be the basis of emerging access network architectures. As part of the proposed research, participation of underrepresented minorities will be encouraged by involving them in this project. The research outcomes from this project will be rolled back into curricula through the development of a special topics course for graduate students on free space optical communication.<br/><br/>In this project, programmable and tunable diffractive optical elements are leveraged to reduce the alignment delay and increase throughput, while new algorithms reconcile the literature on pointing, acquisition & tracking techniques with multi-hop RF-domain neighbor discovery algorithms. A novel FSO frontend for software defined radios, capable of coherent optical communication, will be developed to take advantage of the above enhancements. A simulator model will be extracted from the lessons learned during the hardware design phase, and fed back into the research community."

For example, subduction and delamination, which are the two major geological processes of recycling crustal materials into the deep Earth, can result in seismic heterogeneities and anisotropies in the Earth's interior, as well as destructive Earthquakes and volcanisms on the Earth's surface. Therefore, understanding the nature and dynamics of the Earth's upper mantle is not only crucial for studying the mantle composition and convection but also relevant to society. Due to the difficulties of direct sampling, seismology provides by far the most accurate image of the Earth's upper mantle. Sound velocity and density measurements of relevant minerals are essential for understanding upper mantle seismic observations. Clinopyroxene, as a major phase of the Earth's upper mantle (10-30 vol%) and the dominating mineral of eclogite (about 60-70 vol%), is one of the most important yet least studied groups of minerals of the Earth's interior. Eclogite is widely believed to be the main driving force for subduction and delamination because of its high density. Thus direct density measurements of clinopyroxene at high pressure (P)-temperature (T) conditions are needed for calculating the buoyancy of eclogite in the Earth's interior. In addition, clinopyroxene is the most anisotropic major mineral in the Earth's upper mantle. It is also the only phase that contributes to any observed anisotropy of eclogite. Explanation of seismically observed upper mantle anisotropy requires knowledge of single-crystal elasticity of clinopyroxene at real Earth P-T conditions. Previous experimental studies have been limited mainly to high-symmetry materials, such as garnet, under P-T conditions far less than those expected in the Earth's interior. The purpose of this study is to measure the density and single-crystal elasticity of clinopyroxene in-situ, implement the optical system that is needed to complete the proposed experiments at University of New Mexico, apply the obtained experimental results to real Earth, and create unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, especially underrepresented minority students, to participate in scientific research at the state-of-the-art experimental facilities both on campus and at national laboratories.<br/><br/>The investigators will use synchrotron single-crystal micro-diffraction and single-crystal Brillouin spectroscopy combined with CO2 laser heating or resistive heating methods to systematically investigate the thermoelastic properties (including density and single-crystal elasticity) of clinopyroxene with different chemical compositions up to 1800K and 18 GPa, covering the entire stability field in the Earth's upper mantle. The obtained experimental result will be used to assist seismic interpretation and geodynamical modeling, which will eventually contribute to our understanding of the origin and nature of the anisotropy and heterogeneity observed in the Earth's upper mantle."

They provide a clean, noise-free, reliable and green energy solution. Most of these devices are of low efficiency, which limits their applications in the market. They are mostly studied and designed to operate in the linear regime under small temperature differences. Like any other heat engine, the efficiency increases as the temperature difference increases. Therefore, in real applications, it is desired to impose large temperature differences to obtain higher output powers and higher efficiencies. When large temperature differences are applied, electrons are out of equilibrium with lattice and under highly non-equilibrium conditions, responses can be nonlinear. Here, the PI will study the highly non-equilibrium and nonlinear regime numerically using a comprehensive Monte Carlo method for electron transport. The PI will use thermo-reflectance technique to study the device operation experimentally. The experimental and numerical results will be used to design solid-state power generators suitable to work under large temperature differences. The results serve as a step toward wide commercialization of solid-state power generators. The PI will partner with different local programs to arrange for workshops throughout the year, in which the PI will design different hands-on activities and will introduce students to computer programing, thermal imaging, and renewable energies.  <br/>Technical: <br/>In solid-state power generators, it is desired to transport heat from cathode to anode via electrons while restricting heat transport via lattice. Therefore, it is advantageous to have highly non-equilibrium electrons and operate in the nonlinear regime. Most theoretical tools developed so far are valid only in the linear transport regime where the output powers are small. In the linear transport, materials figure of merit, ZT, determines the efficiency. In the nonlinear regime, ZT is not the only relevant parameter and other parameters such as convective heat transfer coefficient, strength of electron-phonon coupling; applied field and geometry of the device play important roles. To study the nonlinear regime, the PI will develop a Monte Carlo code for electron-phonon transport, enabling investigation of charge, spin and heat transport under large applied fields and for different device geometries. The inputs of the code including interfacial transmission will be calculated using first principles. In addition to the capability of this tool, such numerical codes will help developing a fundamental understanding of transport and insights for developing analytical models for device analysis. The full solution of heat transfer problem including convection/radiation will address more practical but equally important aspect of the efficiency optimization problem. Finally, the PI will use thermo-reflectance imaging and thermomagnetic characterization to study nonlinear transport experimentally. These experiments provide a method for validation of the numerical predictions and additional insights to the device operation."

Today's voltage regulator is usually constructed using discrete components and assembled on the motherboard. The discrete passive components such as inductors and capacitors are bulky and occupy a considerable footprint on the motherboard. Furthermore, the power delivery path from the voltage regulators to the microprocessors is relatively long. Recently there has been great demand for a very high-frequency integrated voltage regulator that can be placed very close to the microprocessor to support dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, which is a very effective power consumption reduction technique for microprocessors. This would entail the supply voltage changing dynamically according to the microprocessor workload (a lower workload leads to a lower supply voltage; a lower supply voltage also leads to a lower clock frequency). As a result, both the dynamic and static power consumption of the microprocessor can be greatly reduced. However, traditional discrete voltage regulators are not able to realize the full potential of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling since they are not able to modulate the supply voltage fast enough due to the high parasitic interconnect impedance between the voltage regulators and the microprocessors. This project focuses on developing a 20-50MHz three-dimensional integrated voltage regulator for mobile devices such as smartphones. The research is expected to have a significant impact on power management solutions for smartphones as well as other mobile applications. The work will help to make the integrated voltage regulator a feasible approach to significantly reduce power consumption in mobile devices, which will greatly extend battery life and reduce electricity consumption. The integrated education plan will help to maintain the competitive vitality of the United States power electronics workforce by quickly incorporating high-frequency power converter design into the curriculum, and by retraining industry power electronics workers through short courses. The planned education activities also include outreach to students in grades K-12 and underrepresented groups to increase familiarity and attractiveness of the area of power electronics.<br/><br/>The research goal of this project is developing a 20-50MHz three-dimensional integrated multi-phase voltage regulator that can support dynamic voltage and frequency scaling for mobile devices such as smartphones. A unique lateral flux inductor structure will be used to integrate multiple inductors into a single-piece magnetic core. The proposed single-core multi-phase lateral flux inductor structure can simultaneously achieve low-profile, high-density, low winding resistance and confined-flux. It can also have controllable nonlinear inductance (the smaller the inductor current, the larger the inductance) to increase voltage regulator light-load efficiency, which is very important for the smartphone application. This unique magnetic component will serve as a substrate stacked with semiconductor devices to realize three-dimensional integration. Two different technologies will be used to realize integration. One is printed circuit board embedding. This technique is compatible with today's printed circuit board fabrication process, which will help to speed industry's adoption of integrated voltage regulators. The second technology is three-dimensional printing. A three-dimensional printer capable of co-dispensing different pastes will be used to construct the inductor substrate which includes both a magnetic layer and a non-magnetic layer. The magnetic layer is used to build a multi-phase lateral flux inductor; the non-magnetic layer is used to build metal traces to realize a necessary electrical connection for the integrated voltage regulator. This technique will enable the integration of a very complicated inductor structure, which will bring a paradigm shift in power converter packaging and integration. Furthermore, a high bandwidth non-ripple-based constant on-time control will be developed for the proposed integrated multi-phase voltage regulators. This new control will have phase overlapping and turn-on-time extension capability for fast transient speed."

These types of decisions are ubiquitous both for humans and animals and there are striking parallels between intertemporal decisions across species in terms of impulsivity.  The ?similarity? model of choice, a relatively new approach to understanding decision making in humans, provides a cognitive and procedural mechanism whereby choices are made. The objective of this project is to determine whether this model can apply to animals and, specifically, to three species of jays. Understanding intertemporal choice in animals will allow us to investigate aspects of impulsivity that are not easy to test in humans and will yield insights into how and why humans make decisions in the way that they do. Intertemporal choices underlie some of the most pressing problems facing society from obesity to inadequate investment in retirement. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these choices can help people make better decisions by focusing their attention on the long-term benefits of a healthy lifestyle or a secure financial future.<br/><br/>The overarching objective of the project is to unify the study of intertemporal choice across humans and animals by applying a model developed for humans to other species. Specific goals are to (1) develop and validate an index of similarity in animals, (2) extend the similarity model of intertemporal choice to animals in foraging and social tasks, and (3) develop a general similarity model by including continuous similarity judgments. This project will provide the first test of a new class of models of intertemporal choice in animals, the first measurement and comparison of the similarity construct across different animal species, and the first test of similarity models across decision domains, thus improving our understanding of decision making and having critical implications for a range of fields. It also addresses the societal goals of providing research opportunities for a diverse range of undergraduates and involving the public in science through the development of software to engage and educate."

Waves can kick up sediment from the bed causing erosion, making the water cloudy and adding pollutants to the water. Vegetation reduces wave motion and keeps sediment from being kicked up. However, this benefit of vegetation cannot be incorporated into lake and coastal management plans, because there is no accurate method for predicting the reduction of wave motion by vegetation. This project will develop a model for predicting the reduction of wave energy from vegetation based on the characteristic of the vegetation, including geometry, size and flexibility. With this new model, engineers and watershed managers will be able to assess different scenarios of vegetation restoration for their potential to protect shorelines and to reduce erosion events that drive poor water quality. <br/><br/>This laboratory study explores the interaction between flexible vegetation and waves to develop predictive models for the impact of vegetation on wave energy dissipation. Flexible vegetation bends in response to flow, and this reconfiguration alters the vegetation drag. The impact of reconfiguration can be described in terms of an effective plant length, le, which is the length of rigid plant that imparts the same hydrodynamic drag as the reconfigured flexible plant. In a preliminary study, the PI?s lab developed scaling laws for individual plants with simple strap morphology (fresh and saltwater eelgrass) that predict the drag in current and in waves. This new study will extend the scaling laws to communities of plants (meadows), to conditions with combined currents and waves, and to plants of more complex morphology (e.g. Elodea and Potamogeton). Specifically, this study will develop models to predict le from plant geometric and biomechanical properties, and current and wave-field parameters, and will demonstrate how the effective length can be used to predict the wave energy dissipation over a meadow in waves and in combined wave-current conditions. The experiments will be carried out in a 24m-long and 60cm-deep water channel with a paddle wavemaker. Initially, model blades will be constructed from low (LDPE) and high (HDPE) density polyethylene. Later experiments will consider more complex morphologies using both live plants and 3-D printed models. The motion of individual blades will be captured with digital imaging, and the forces on individual blades in isolation and within a meadow will be measured with a submersible force transducer. The velocity field will be measured with acoustic Doppler velocimetry and PIV. The dissipation of wave energy will be estimated from the longitudinal decay of wave amplitude, which will be measured using resistance-type water surface gages. This project will contribute fundamental understanding to fluid-flexible-structure interaction, which is relevant to many engineering topics, e.g. passive energy-harvesting devices and flow-control with flexible surfaces. Relevant to earth systems, this project will develop a unified model for predicting wave dissipation due to plants of different morphology and across the range of relevant field conditions. <br/>"

The investigators plan to recover data that will be destroyed by a planned forest burn scheduled for Spring 2017.   Pre and post-colonial period Native Americans actively managed their natural environments through the use of fire to produce grasslands and boost bison populations and this at risk data has the potential to provide critical insights into the natural resource management practices of Native North Americans from the 1600's to the present.  A key element of the research is to use the recovered data to map the landscape of the Clear Water Valley in Alberta Canada and to estimate the population numbers of bison supported in the region historically to the present.   Understanding the historic ecosystem and the bison populations in the region is a critical part of the decision to reintroduce bison species in the Rocky Mountain region.  As a subsistence species utilized by early Native Americans for food, shelter, clothing, and religious practice, bison are a cultural and natural keystone species in the region.   As a species hunted to near extinction by the late 1800's, currently, both public and Tribal land managers are considering projects to reintroduce bison into contemporary ecosystems.   The researchers argue that after bison and traditional indigenous land management were removed from these ecosystems in the late 1800's the landscape substantially changed, to the point that it may no longer be suitable for bison reintroduction.    The project will map, quantify, and provide insights into how Indigenous burning historically created habitats supporting substantial bison populations in the Rocky Mountains near Banff National Park (BNP) in Canada, which can be compared to other regions of the North where cultural burning was also practiced.  In addition, the researchers will provide insights into the implications of these landscape transformations and their disappearance for the management of forests, fire, and fauna today. <br/><br/>The region for the RAPID is anticipated to be particularly well suited for study; 1) Banff National Park has a bison reintroduction program and 2) it is a region where Indigenous peoples, such as the Kootenai, historically used cultural burning to create open and nutrient-enriched grassy habitat for bison. Today, these and similar Rocky Mountain valleys are densely forested due to the exclusion of traditional indigenous burning, the introduction of modern fire suppression, and other factors.  In order to assess and achieve bison restoration objectives similar to what existed historically, it is vital to quantify landscape condition during the period of traditional indigenous management. Coordination between fire management programs and bison reintroduction groups could benefit the interests of both groups and improve the odds of attaining bison population restoration goals.<br/><br/>This project will demonstrate and quantify changes in bison habitat by creating a 3D time-lapse map showing the transformation of the Clearwater Valley in Alberta, Canada from the 1600s to present.  The research team will recreate the valley's fire history using modern dendrochronology, cross-dating tree scars left by historical fires. This phase of research will produce a stand age structure reconstruction, a traditional fire scar history using the program FHAES, a climate reconstruction (to determine the degree of anthropogenic vs. climatic influence on the fire regime(s) over time), a comparison of known historical human and bison population events (such as smallpox outbreaks) with fire frequency and tree recruitment shifts, and spatiotemporal GIS maps compiling all of the above.  In addition, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will collect 3-dimensional landscape data to measure the valley's modern biotic landscape.  A digital time-lapse map will incorporate the tree-ring history to extend the 3D landscape model back in time. Lastly, the investigators will derive estimates of how much biomass burning has changed over the course of the last 300+ years in the Clearwater Valley sample area. <br/><br/>The project's novel fusion of dendrochronology and 3D spatiotemporal GIS expands the realm of what is possible for scientific methodology across disciplinary boundaries. The results of this study will also be applicable across national boundaries by showing not only how much change in the landscape would be necessary for Banff National Park's bison restoration goals, but also demonstrate the need for similar investigations by land managers across North America."

Transposable elements are abundant DNA sequences found in all genomes, and their ability to move or copy themselves to new locations in the genome contributes to changes that can lead to new genetic traits. The focus of this research is the mPing element from rice, which belongs to a transposable element family that is broadly distributed in plants, animals, insects, and fungi.  Understanding how movement of mPing is controlled offers the potential to exploit these elements as tools for identifying genes associated with beneficial traits, such as high grain yield in cereal crops.  This project will have broad educational impacts relevant to workforce development by engaging a large number of undergraduate students through an inquiry-based biochemistry laboratory course that offers hands-on experience in genetics and protein chemistry.  The project will also involve students in the research laboratory, providing them with direct participation in all phases of the discovery process, from experimentation to presentation and publication of their findings.  <br/><br/>This research will use both genetic and biochemical analyses to determine (1) how mPing regulates its own movement within the genome, (2) the factors that determine its insertion site preference, and (3) how mPing is replicated. This research builds on three previous observations, i.e., increased movement in hyperactive mPing mutants, preference for insertion into nearby genes, and the ability to increase in copy number over time. The mechanisms controlling transposition rate will be analyzed by determining the factors that regulate formation of the active transposition complex. This includes in vivo binding assays (yeast one-hybrid and yeast two-hybrid) to identify the nucleotides and amino acid residues responsible for interactions within the DNA-protein complex. The effects of mutations that modify transposition complex formation will be tested using a previously established yeast transposition assay. To determine if transposition timing is linked to cell cycle control, microscopy will be used to follow the dynamics of transposase protein localization during cell division. The mechanism of mPing insertion site selection will be investigated by determining how altering chromatin structure changes the insertion pattern. The role of homologous recombination repair in the replication of mPing will also be addressed by measuring mPing duplication in control and DNA repair mutants. Together, the results will define the critical self-regulatory mechanisms that control movement in this active transposable element and thereby will suggest what specific changes could be made to increase the utility of these elements as tools for genome engineering.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate and by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)."

These include the deployment of methane and/or hydrogen gases as alternative fuels, development of new filters for removing trace gaseous contaminants from air, and separation of carbon dioxide from flue gas to mitigate greenhouse emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.  In the past decade, the design of novel porous materials on the molecular level has led to an exponential growth in the available structures, with variations in porosity, topology, and surface area all affecting performance of the material in a given application.  Computational methods have enabled rapid screening of the available materials for particular conditions, but also highlighted that certain material performance technical targets may not be achievable.    <br/> <br/>In this project, computational methods will be used to probe the limits of material performance for physical adsorption to porous materials at ambient and sub-ambient temperatures.  Whereas past computational screening has suggested physical limits of adsorption capacity for one class of materials, i.e., metal organic frameworks (MOFs), this project will explore pseudomaterials, which represent all potential atomistic arrangements of matter in a porous material.  The upper bound in performance of pseudomaterials will necessarily represent an upper bound of the real material subset, and thus provide the identification of physical limits of material performance that can be used for engineering design and research prioritization.  Classical molecular modeling will be used to compute adsorption capacity and diffusivity, and the Maxwell model will be used to predict the selectivity of mixed-matrix membranes; force field parameters for the pseudomaterials will be systematically and continuously varied to bracket reasonable limits. Optimization procedures will be used to manage the large potential configuration of parameters. The observed upper bounds for material performance will be correlated to material design parameters, such as surface area and pore volume, among others. One graduate student will be trained in this project, which will also include mentoring of high school students and undergraduates from underrepresented minority groups.  An educational outreach plan will include development and dissemination of educational movies on the fundamental science of gas adsorption, including those relevant to carbon capture to mitigate climate change."

However, the mechanism of flow enhancement in these nanochannels is not fully understood, in part because prior experiments produced highly variable results. This award will support a series of experiments to help reconcile ambiguities in prior experiments and, more importantly, to help uncover the underlying mechanisms of flow enhancement at nanoscale dimensions. Unlike most prior experiments that used flow through arrays of nanochannels in a thin membrane, this project will measure flow of water and ions through individual nanofluidic conduits. A new method of nanochannel design and fabrication, coupled with capillary flow, will be used to directly measure the hydraulic resistance, ionic conductance and mobility, as well as water and ion flow enhancement in single, well-defined carbon nanotubes and graphene nanochannels. Correlations between flow enhancement and material properties, supported by computational modeling, will elucidate key factors that make flow through carbon nanofluidic conduits unique. The results will be useful in designing and fabricating carbon nanofluidic devices and structures for a variety of applications, including water desalination, batteries and fuel cells, lab-on-a-chip, as well as in interpreting certain flows in geology, biology and physiology. The award includes support for educational activities for students at all academic levels. Cartoon animations and hands-on lab kits that illustrate the unique physics of flow at the nanoscale will be developed for use by K-12 students. The project will provide opportunities for undergraduates, especially those from underrepresented groups, to participate in the research. <br/><br/>Since research using membranes consisting of multi-conduit carbon nanotubes or graphene nanochannels introduces ambiguities due to conduit-size polydispersity, this award will study water and ion transport in single carbon nanotubes and graphene nanochannels with well-defined sizes, surface properties and barrier materials. The experiments will test the hypothesis that fast mass transport of water and ions in these channels results from unique surface-water and surface-ion interactions, which strongly depend on the substrate or barrier material as well as on the confinement and surface properties of these carbon nanofluidic conduits. Experimental measurements will be compared with molecular dynamics simulations that consider explicitly effects of substrate/barrier material, surface charge, and ion-water interactions. The carbon nanofluidic devices fabricated in this project will also provide investigators a platform to study selective ion and gas transport, which could not only improve understanding of carbon nanofluidics, but also expand its practical applications to chemical and biological separations processes."

In spite of the far-reaching implications of this distinction, ranging from the structuring of economic policies to the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral pathology, much is still unknown about what factors shape goal-directed decisions and what conditions prompt a transition from goal-directed to habitual action selection.  Generally, while computationally expensive, a goal-directed strategy offers greater levels of flexible instrumental control.  Since subjective utilities often change from one moment to the next, such flexibility is essential for reward maximization and thus may have intrinsic value, potentially serving to motivate and reinforce specific decisions, as well as to justify the general processing cost of goal-directed computations.  A critical requirement for flexible instrumental control, however, is that available action alternatives yield distinct outcome states.  With the support of this NSF Career award, Dr. Mimi Liljeholm is investigating the novel hypotheses that instrumental divergence? the difference between outcome probability distributions associated with alternative actions? can shape choice preferences, induce conditioned reinforcement, and arbitrate between goal-directed and habitual decision strategies.  The objective of this research is to address important gaps in current knowledge about the nature and limits of goal-directed behavior, using a combination of innovative experimental designs, computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  The educational component of the award provides hands-on training in neuroimaging methods, and in the computational and neural bases of learning and decision-making, at undergraduate and graduate levels.  <br/><br/>All studies use a simple gambling task in which alternative actions yield different colored tokens, each worth a particular amount of money, with various probabilities.  In studies assessing a preference for flexible instrumental control, the relevant choice is between pairs of actions with different levels of instrumental divergence.  Expected monetary pay-offs vary independently of instrumental divergence across options, dissociating the relative contribution of each factor to behavioral choice performance.  Studies investigating the capacity of high instrumental divergence to induce conditioned reinforcement measure changes in the affective valence of visual stimuli based on their association with high versus low instrumental divergence.  Finally, following extended exposure to high versus low instrumental divergence, the degree to which behavior is goal-directed or habitual is assessed using a standardly employed outcome devaluation procedure, in which the monetary amount associated with a particular token color is altered: Goal-directed, but not habitual, decisions are modulated by such changes in the utility of sensory-specific outcomes states.  Neuroimaging data is acquired by scanning participants with fMRI as they perform the task, and a reinforcement learning framework is used to model the intrinsic value of flexible instrumental control (by treating instrumental divergence as a surrogate reward) at behavioral and neural levels. Since many psychiatric disorders are characterized by an abnormal sense of agency, and addiction associated with a rapid transition from goal-directed to habitual action-selection, broader impacts of this project include the potential development of pre-clinical diagnostic assays for early detection of cognitive, affective and behavioral pathology.  The concepts advanced under this project may also help improve the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms, for example by using instrumental divergence to specify new optimization criteria, potentially benefiting medical, industrial and commercial applications of artificial intelligence."

SciDAS relies on the integrated-Rule-Oriented-Data-System (iRODS), enhanced with software-defined-networking (SDN) capabilities, to support network-aware data management decisions and efficient use of network resources. The distributed and scalable nature of both the data-sharing and the compute infrastructure are exploited to optimize for computer and data locality, boosting the performance of workflows and scientific productivity.

The Walvis Ridge, which is now located off of Africa, also formed near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge close to the same time. The Rio Grande Rise is about twice the volume of Walvis Ridge and together they record ~130 Myr of intra-plate volcanism and are hypothesized to represent the products of a deep mantle plume. Despite its extremely large size and prolonged volcanic history, Rio Grande Rise truly is terra incognita. Based on the few rock samples available, it appears that Rio Grande Rise formed between 70 and 90 million years ago at the same time as the older part of Walvis Ridge. To understand the history of these large volcanic features, this project will carry out a seagoing cruise to the Rio Grande Rise to survey and collect rock samples from 40 seamounts, rift zone valleys and steep escarpments. These new data will allow a thorough investigation of the formation of the Rio Grande Rise and its relationship to the Walvis Ridge where rock samples have already been collected.  The new data will also provide a unique opportunity to address a wide range of questions relating to plate tectonics, including how the Rio Grande Rise is related to the deep dense mantle zone of the African large low shear wave velocity province (LLSVP) which is thought to be a place where mantle plumes are generated.  This project is in collaboration with Brazilian scientists and students. The project supports the training of U.S. graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The newly collected geochronological, geochemical and geophysical data will contribute significantly to the following two major science questions: (1) Is Rio Grande Rise shaped by plume dynamics, shallow tectonics or both and what are the consequences for understanding hotspot evolution? (2) What are the mantle sources related to the deep dense mantle zone of the African large low shear wave velocity province (LLSVP)?  Determining when Rio Grande Rise and Walvis Ridge volcanism became associated with intra-plate hotspot volcanism alone is fundamental as these volcanic traces are essential for calculating African absolute plate motion and global plate circuit models back to 130 million years. Moreover, if the large volume of the Rio Grande Rise-Walvis Ridge system and its source link back to the edge of the LLSVP, this will provide a unique possibility to investigate whether their extreme enriched composition represents a major component in the lower mantle."

To speed up computation, there is an increasing interest in distributed computation; however, distributing a computational task over multiple heterogeneous machines involves data movement between machines leading to communication bottlenecks, significantly impacting the time for computation. By reducing the cost and time for distributed computation, the research outcomes can have a significant and immediate economic benefit as well as a lasting societal impact. The research objectives of this project are strongly interconnected with educational components and outreach activities, which include undergraduate research involvement, interdisciplinary curriculum development, outreach to K-12 in collaboration with SARSEF (Southern Arizona Research, Science and Engineering Foundation), and raising STEM awareness through the STEM learning center and the Arizona Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (ASEM) scholars mentoring program.<br/><br/>To enable communication-efficient distributed computation, this CAREER project will pursue the following intertwined research objectives. The first research objective is to make distributed data shuffling communication-efficient through novel coded data delivery mechanisms, that are adaptable to the underlying topology and can cope with the temporal nature of computational tasks. The second research objective is to reduce the impact of computational heterogeneity by novel work exchange algorithms through intermediate communication while minimizing the time for computation. The third research objective complements the first two in characterizing fundamental information theoretic limits by developing lower bounds on the communication necessary for: a) data shuffling as a function of storage and topology; and b) the minimum time for computation as a function of intermediate communication and storage."

Though these technologies offer great potential benefits, they also raise new and serious computer security and privacy risks. This project focuses on investigating and addressing security and privacy issues due to the virtual output (visual, audio, or haptic feedback) that AR applications generate. Consider, for instance, an AR automotive windshield application that blocks the user's view of pedestrians or road signs with attention-grabbing advertisements, or startles the user with sudden loud advertising jingles; this behavior could have serious physical safety implications. Or consider an AR head-mounted display like the Microsoft HoloLens, in which an application might maliciously draw phobia-inducing objects (like spiders) in the user's visual environment. Combined with integrated education and outreach efforts, this work provides a technical foundation that pushes research and industry towards augmented reality platforms that provide rich functionality and strong security, privacy, and safety properties. <br/><br/>This project explores and addresses several technical challenges with securing AR application outputs. These challenges include: achieving security, privacy, and safety properties simultaneously with high performance and rich functionality; mitigating the risk of physical harm to people and property; and supporting multiple complex applications simultaneously augmenting the user's view of the physical world. The project addresses these challenges by identifying risks due to malicious or buggy AR application output (i.e., visual, audio, or haptic feedback), empirically evaluating these risks in existing and emerging AR platforms (e.g., Microsoft HoloLens and Meta's glasses), and exploring the role of an AR platform's OS in securing virtual output from untrusted applications, while enabling application developers to create rich, compelling AR scenarios. The researchers are designing options for an AR operating system, as well as broader security and safety recommendations for how emerging AR platforms (including car windshields and head-mounted displays) should manage AR output."

Low-rank estimation problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Recently developed nonconvex methods promise great computational gains on large-scale datasets, but the algorithmic and theoretical foundation has not yet reached the same level of maturity as their convex counterpart. This research attacks this deficit in two research thrusts: pushing the limits of nonconvex methods for greater flexibility through a unified theoretical framework, and developing new algorithms robust to data corruption. <br/><br/>To achieve greater flexibility and generality for the nonconvex approach, the investigator develops a new unifying paradigm that explains when and why nonconvex methods succeed. This is accomplished by a novel reinterpretation of various nonconvex methods through a two-step procedure. This flexible framework unifies several existing algorithms including gradient descent and alternating minimization, and opens the door for designing new algorithms. Theoretically this unified view allows for a decoupling of the statistical and optimization analysis. The investigator will explore the consequences of this approach by (a) providing a simpler and modular analysis of the convergence and statistical properties of existing algorithms, (b) studying the global behaviors of nonconvex methods and the role of initialization, and (c) designing new algorithms that are more efficient and general. The second thrust of this project studies the robustness of nonconvex methods. To protect against arbitrary corruption in data, the investigator designs new robust nonconvex formulations by viewing corruption as a superimposed structure and leveraging sparsity in the optimization objectives. This result will be further expanded through the use of nonsmooth nonconvex formulations and a complete rethinking of existing analytic techniques."

Satellite remote sensing technologies provide global coverage of observations at a high spatio-temporal resolution. Due to the relatively short life span of between 8-10 years for the individual satellites, one needs to combine the observation records of multiple satellites that were launched at different eras for monitoring and understanding climate changes. The challenging of using satellite observations for climate studies is that one needs to remove/reduce inconsistencies or biases within a satellite mission due to orbital drifting and between continuous satellite missions with the same sensors due to changes of orbital parameters, besides the need of inter-satellite calibration/validation of different sensors. One of the two main objectives of this funded project is to systematically identify and correct climate scale biases/drifts in microwave brightness temperature measurements of satellites in both troposphere and stratosphere using other observation records. The PI has developed and demonstrated the key methodologies for this funded research in his dissertation research.<br/><br/>The funded project will also take a fresh new look at this challenging question: what causes large uncertainties in projecting climate change using climate models?  The PI plans to explore if and how the strength of climate feedbacks in climate models are linked to the models? own climate states. If a linkage to the models? climate feedbacks and the models? mean states can be identified, the future global warming projection uncertainties can be reduced by using such observations to constraint models mean states.  <br/><br/>The proposed research will advance our understanding of sources based on biases in both observations and climate models which will enable better decision-making."

Results of this research will significantly advance our knowledge of these issues by examining the cycling of volatiles between the surface and deep Earth through the study of nitrogen isotope geochemistry in a variety of rocks and fluids that have a mantle origin and come from different places in the ocean basins and from different tectonic settings.  The research focuses on nitrogen because it is a sensitive tracer of interactions between Earth's interior and exterior volatile reservoirs due to its high abundance in air (about 78% of the atmosphere) and parts-per-million concentration in the mantle. Due to the ubiquitous presence of nitrogen in all surface environments and the small amount of nitrogen in mantle rocks, measuring the original signature of the nitrogen in the mantle, through its isotopes, without the interfering effects of atmospheric nitrogen is an major analytical challenge. As a result, the data on nitrogen isotopes in rocks and the mantle is extremely limited. The laboratory conducting this research is one of the few in the world that has the analytical capability of making such low-level nitrogen isotopic measurements. Samples of mantle-derived materials for analysis have been selected on the basis of the quality and comprehensiveness of other geochemical data and consist of materials from ocean islands, mid-ocean ridge spreading axes, back-arc basins, submarine basaltic lavas, mantle xenoliths, mafic phenocrysts, and geothermal fluids. These data will produce an essential database of the nitrogen isotopic variation in the oceanic mantle from which hypotheses on the origin and growth of the atmosphere and the cycling of volatiles between surface and deep Earth systems can be posed. Broader impacts of the work include the training of students who will be involved in all aspects of the work and will be trained on state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Students will also be involved in science communication and teaching activities and public outreach opportunities offered through University of San Diego Extension Program that provides college-level instruction to high-school students in under-served regions of San Diego County. The outreach activities will provide student instructors with a much-needed complement to the research focus of the study and will help transmit research results and the excitement of science to the public.  Additional impacts include the refining and development of new laboratory techniques to allow measurement of vanishingly small amounts of nitrogen and its isotopes in geological materials. <br/><br/>Nitrogen isotopes provide key constraints on the interaction between Earth's atmosphere and interior reservoirs, as well as on the evolutionary history of those reservoirs. Oceanic basaltic glasses from the Lau, Manus, and Alarcon basins will be studied using high-resolution, small-volume mass spectrometry that will allow the characterization of the nitrogen isotope variability in these samples to be determined, which in turn will help to determine the nitrogen isotopic variability of the mantle underlying the oceans. Samples targeted include those that indicate the presence of plume-influenced mantle (i.e., those that have the highest 3He/4He isotope ratios). Volcanic glasses will be analyzed where 3He/4He ratios fall in the nominal range of mantle compositions indicating that they are associated with the mantle source for mid-ocean ridge basalts. Samples that already are well-characterized geochemically for the radiogenic isotopic ratios of strontium, neodymium, and lead and the noble gases helium, neon, and argon as well as CO2 and H2O will be analyzed to test the degree to which the nitrogen isotope ratios of samples and these other petrogenetic tracers can be used to distinguish between mantle signatures and other controls on the isotopic composition of nitrogen, such as magma degassing and/or fractionation. Samples sets that include mafic phenocrysts and xenoliths from the Canary Islands hotspot plus phenocrysts from a number of ocean island basalts and geothermal fluids from Hawaii will also be analyzed. The results of this work will allow scrutiny and the determination of coupling between the nitrogen and helium isotope ratios and their relationship in terms of the variability of nitrogen isotopes in the ocean mantle from the perspective of different sampling media and regional controls. The mafic phenocrysts work will help define limits for sample Nitrogen-contents required for analysis, potentially leading to a significant increase in the sample base amenable to nitrogen isotopic analysis."

Surgery and drugs fail to eliminate the malignant cells that infiltrate centimeters beyond the bulk central mass and radiotherapies damage healthy and malignant tissues alike.  This project builds on preliminary studies in tissue-engineered models of GBM that demonstrate that pulsed electric fields (PEFs) induce selective destruction of tumor cells by targeting their altered electrical properties, e.g., changes in surface charge, membrane capacitance and ion channel expression.  Furthermore, this effect, which targets a physical hallmark of the tumor leaving normal cells relatively unaffected, is enhanced by the addition of drug therapies, which target alterations in tumor cell chemical properties.  The goal of this project is to develop a platform to enable efficient screening of the effects of combined physical/drug treatments on patient-derived cells. This novel platform will expand understanding of the beneficial effects of the combined approach and underpin basic science and clinically important advances in a new precision medicine paradigm.  The education and outreach plan includes: 1) expanding the ""Cancer Engineering"" curriculum, outreach, and diversity at Virginia Tech through new and updated courses, research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and supporting K-12 activities for economically disadvantaged students in Southwest Virginia and 2) establishing an ""Ask a Virginia Tech Scientist"" web column, which will cover a wide spectrum of topics in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), for local K-12 students and teachers and community engagement.  <br/><br/>Effective precision cancer medicine protocols will ultimately depend on multi-targeted therapies to treat highly heterogeneous and adaptable tumors such as GBM. The platform developed in this project will be the very first tissue array microchip with an overlay of multiple types of dynamic therapeutic gradients (e.g. electric field amplitude and drug concentration) in orthogonal directions. The platform will be compatible with high-resolution live measurement of cellular dynamics, and coupled to powerful microfluidic molecular analysis to characterize the epigenomic alterations in stimulated cells, uniquely enabling broad-spectrum parametric analysis of combinatorial electrical/molecular treatments of patient-derived cells. The research plan is organized under three objectives:  1) develop a multi-dimensional electrical/chemical gradient microtissue array chip compatible with high-resolution confocal imaging and impedance measurement, 2) develop high-resolution epigenomic analysis with novel coupling to microfluidic chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and 3) execute broad-spectrum parametric studies of combinatorial electrical/chemical treatments using patient GBM cells.  Successful completion of these objectives will be crucial to: 1) reveal therapeutic synergies possible through a combination of PEFs and drugs, 2) optimize combinatorial treatments with minimal input material (e.g. cells, reagents), and 3) test molecular hypotheses related to treatment synergies.  The data collected will provide basic science insights for a new and effective treatment strategy for infiltrative tumors. The combined physical and chemical approaches to targeting both the dense core, as well as the diffuse infiltrative zones will potentially altering the paradigm of GBM treatment."

The meetings, to be held January 28 through February 3, 2017 at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas will advance the field by introducing new emerging paradigms not presented previously. The GRC is internationally known for high-quality, cutting-edge meetings, and because of this many scientists want to attend and contribute to a GRC. The scientific talks, discussions, and poster presentations at the 2017 meeting will stimulate new research directions, and provide underpinnings for collaborative interactions that advance the study of lipid signaling, metabolism, and function. In addition to this impact on the field, the GRS will offer a concentrated opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to network and learn. Participating as a presenter and interacting with other scientists in the supportive atmosphere of the GRS and GRC provides an excellent opportunity for beginning researchers to develop a strong network of peers and senior colleagues, while increasing scientific breadth and depth. Lunch table mentoring sessions also seek to actively engage students with established investigators to ask questions. The GRC on Plant Lipids has an excellent track record in recruiting diverse speakers and providing leadership opportunities to women, specifically the current proportion of women among the invited speakers and discussion leaders (33%). Additional speakers of under-represented status will be sought to attend the meeting. <br/><br/>Topics to be discussed include plant lipid-mediated post-translational modification; genome modification approaches to metabolic engineering of lipid biosynthesis; ""omic"" platforms for lipid analyses; lipid imaging, spectroscopy; molecular modelling and computational approaches. Moreover, new approaches to stimulate critical discussion will also be deployed, including a focus on integration of knowledge and approaches between metabolism and lipid signaling. Second, significant meeting time will be devoted to selected talks from submitted abstracts and as such more presentations on novel technologies like flux modeling, and exposure to the state of the art technologies for early career scientists at the GRC meeting. Together, these activities will ensure that the GRC on Plant Lipids will bring together experts working to create and disseminate new research tools, discover fundamental paradigms for lipid-mediated regulation of plant responses to developmental and environmental cues."

The power electronic hardware is separated from the power conversion functionality, specifically the converter topology and control. The resulting VMP conversion is inherently scalable, reconfigurable, and increases reliability through partial redundancy. The VMP approach is expected to reduce engineering costs through modularity and reduce the converter Volt-Ampere power ratings through reconfiguration. In this project, VMP conversion is studied on an automotive drivetrain, where the reconfiguration capabilities reduce the cost and add functionality. Specifically, case studies show the potential for a 20% to 30% reduction of the total Volt-Ampere power converter rating and the addition of onboard fast charging compared to traditional power electronic configurations. In a later stage of the project, the concept will be applied to smart energy home systems with renewable energy generation and/or energy storage, where similar benefits are expected. The power conversion concept will be evaluated in real-world conditions by two student-driven projects. The first application is a photovoltaic-powered irrigation plant in Senegal. This off-grid plant is enhanced with a battery charging station to make excess photovoltaic energy available for lighting and cooking. The second student-driven project will focus on a Formula SAE electrified drivetrain, where the reconfiguration capabilities of the VMP concept will be demonstrated. Both projects will be displayed in engineering outreach programs, for example in laboratory visits for high school students.<br/><br/>The VMP platform follows the computer science virtualization structure. The physical hardware platform is named ""host"". It features control hardware and the fundamental power conversion blocks, named autoconverter modules (ACM). The ACM are designed to be modular and can form power converter topologies, e.g., inverters, active front ends, DC-DC converters, or battery chargers. The resulting converters are named ""guests"" and exist exclusively in the virtual domain. The ""hypervisor"" is the fundamental software component that defines, manages, and controls the guests. Specifically, it allocates the power conversion resources (ACM) to different guests depending on the power and current requirements. The VMP concept is enabled by high performance ACM. The ACM consist of power electronic switches and filter components for simple parallelization. Hardware-specific details and power electronic aspects are abstracted from higher levels. The ACM will be implemented using wide-bandgap power electronic switches with a novel soft-switching technique that will result in modules with high efficiency and high power density. Specifically, Silicon-Carbide (SiC) switches will be combined with a soft-switching concept to achieve high switching frequencies. This approach reduces the filter requirements, which will result in compact modules."

The investigators will engage the public in this work through several outreach programs aimed at increasing both public understanding of scientific research and participation in STEM for students from groups underrepresented in science. The project will also facilitate the training of several undergraduates through a program that prepares first generation college students and members of underrepresented groups for graduate research. <br/><br/>To determine which ecological factors led to the evolution of a wide field of binocular vision during early primate evolution, this project will employ both comparative morphological and experimental methods. First, the investigators will measure binocular field in an ecologically and phylogenetically diverse comparative mammalian sample to determine which ecological variables are associated with increases in binocular field size across mammals. Binocular field size will be measured from micro-CT scans of fluid-preserved specimens that are iodine stained to render the soft tissues of the eyes visible. Second, the researchers will experimentally evaluate the functional importance of binocular vision for the types of grasping and leaping behaviors that competing primate origins hypotheses suggest selected for increased binocular field width. Small-bodied nocturnal strepsirrhines will be filmed performing grasping and leaping tasks under normal conditions and with reduced binocular visual field. This integrated approach to studying the functional significance of a wide field of binocular vision will provide a test of the competing adaptive scenarios for crown primate origins. The results of this project will help to address long-standing debates about a key feature of the primate order."

Due to its intermittency, volatility, and uncertainty, wind power generation has posed grand challenges for power system operations and planning. This project aims at addressing key challenges in wind power integration, including reserve procurement, wind power ramps, and involuntary wind power curtailment. The research of this project will produce the following: 1) a systematic approach for risk assessment and quantification of wind power ramps; 2) an early alarm system for large wind power ramps induced by extreme weather events; and 3) cost-effective operational protocols for acquiring reserves from generation and transmission resources of power networks. The research outcomes will be integrated to develop new multidisciplinary courses to enrich the curriculum of wind engineering program at the National Wind Institute, and to engage undergraduate students in research through design and experimental projects at a dedicated wind power research laboratory that is to be established as an outcome of the project. The project outcomes are expected to impact power system operations by enhancing the operator's situational awareness of wind power ramps, and by improving the reliability, security, and efficiency of bulk power systems and the wholesale electricity market. The integrated research and educational activities will contribute to training qualified engineers and researchers who can contribute to a thriving and sustainable wind energy industry.<br/><br/><br/>The project research seeks fundamental breakthroughs in wind power ramp risk assessment and curtailment reduction to enable efficient utilization of increased wind power capacity in bulk power systems. Motivated by a key observation that large wind power ramps exhibit tail behaviors dictated by generalized Pareto distributions, a systematic method for quantifying wind power ramp risk is developed, based on which the adequate amount of reserves can be determined in a rigorous manner. Along a different path, preliminary studies using real-world data from Mesonet and dispersed wind farms reveal that Mesonet measurements indeed contain critical signatures of large wind power ramps induced by extreme weather events (fronts, thunderstorms, icing events, etc.), which state-of-the-art wind power forecasting systems may fail to capture. With this insight, a Mesonet-based early alarm system will be designed to enhance the power system operator's risk awareness with respect to large wind power ramps. Further, an innovative concept of line transfer margin will be developed from a congestion risk-limiting viewpoint, which facilitates reduction of involuntary wind power curtailment by suppressing congestion risk and by improving the deliverability of reserves. These line transfer margins can be easily pre-computed by using basic statistical information on nodal wind power generation together with the flow distribution factors of power networks. The research encompasses several innovative and nontraditional approaches, including risk quantification of wind power ramps using extreme value theory, wind power ramp events detection through networked data analytics, and exploratory study of dynamic reserve zoning from a graph-theoretic perspective."

However, linguists studying language variation and change typically treat cities and suburbs as a uniform metropolitan area. This project takes the position that if we do not understand patterns of language variation and change in suburbs -- whether along geographical, demographic, or ideological lines -- we do not understand patterns of variation and change in the US. It seeks to build on previous sociolinguistic work both in suburbs and larger urban areas, with a research question of how language use and language change in suburban areas relates to patterns found in cities. <br/><br/>This project uses the St. Louis metropolitan area, a site well-known for its extensive suburbanization and White flight, as a case study. Eighty-four participants, twenty-eight each from a neighborhood in the City of St. Louis, a suburb that developed in the 1930s, and a suburb that developed through urban sprawl in the 1970-1980s, will complete a questionnaire and engage in a sociolinguistic interview, including a word list and reading passage. Acoustic analysis of several vowels obtained in the interview and elicitations will be used alongside the questionnaire data to ascertain linguistic patterns in suburbs.<br/>This project brings the sociolinguistic literature into conversation with current approaches to metropolitan areas in other fields. Additionally, it contributes to understanding the role that federal and local housing policy have played in patterns of suburbanization and residential segregation. The US has only recently begun to grapple with the impacts of these policies (see, for example, the 2014 protests in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri), and this project extends research on their impacts to the linguistic and cultural realms."

The Walvis Ridge, which is now located off of Africa, also formed near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge close to the same time. The Rio Grande Rise is about twice the volume of Walvis Ridge and together they record ~130 Myr of intra-plate volcanism and are hypothesized to represent the products of a deep mantle plume. Despite its extremely large size and prolonged volcanic history, Rio Grande Rise truly is terra incognita. Based on the few rock samples available, it appears that Rio Grande Rise formed between 70 and 90 million years ago at the same time as the older part of Walvis Ridge. To understand the history of these large volcanic features, this project will carry out a seagoing cruise to the Rio Grande Rise to survey and collect rock samples from 40 seamounts, rift zone valleys and steep escarpments. These new data will allow a thorough investigation of the formation of the Rio Grande Rise and its relationship to the Walvis Ridge where rock samples have already been collected.  The new data will also provide a unique opportunity to address a wide range of questions relating to plate tectonics, including how the Rio Grande Rise is related to the deep dense mantle zone of the African large low shear wave velocity province (LLSVP) which is thought to be a place where mantle plumes are generated.  This project is in collaboration with Brazilian scientists and students. The project supports the training of U.S. graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The newly collected geochronological, geochemical and geophysical data will contribute significantly to the following two major science questions: (1) Is Rio Grande Rise shaped by plume dynamics, shallow tectonics or both and what are the consequences for understanding hotspot evolution? (2) What are the mantle sources related to the deep dense mantle zone of the African large low shear wave velocity province (LLSVP)?  Determining when Rio Grande Rise and Walvis Ridge volcanism became associated with intra-plate hotspot volcanism alone is fundamental as these volcanic traces are essential for calculating African absolute plate motion and global plate circuit models back to 130 million years. Moreover, if the large volume of the Rio Grande Rise-Walvis Ridge system and its source link back to the edge of the LLSVP, this will provide a unique possibility to investigate whether their extreme enriched composition represents a major component in the lower mantle."

This extreme warming event is termed as ""Ningaloo Nio"", an analogy to other eastern continental boundary warming phenomena such as El Nio in the Pacific and the Benguela Nio in the Atlantic. During the recent Ningaloo Nio event, SSTs off the west coast of Australia were more than 5 degree centigrade above long-term seasonal means, which is sufficient to impact large-scale atmospheric circulation and has devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and resources. In this region, locally and remotely forced ocean circulations in the southeast Indian Ocean, such as Leeuwin current system, may play a crucial role in the development of the Ningaloo Nio event. The primary goal of this proposed project is to understand physical processes that control the development of Ningaloo Nio/Nia. The proposed project will contribute to the plan and design of major international field campaigns and improving observational network in the Indian Ocean, enhancing education through supporting students and a post-doc, and advancing climate prediction. One of the PIs' institutions is recognized as a Hispanic Serving Institution by the U.S. Department of Education, and thus the project will contribute to providing training opportunities for underrepresented minorities. In addition, the proposed research will identify key processes that must be represented well in climate models, which will help improve climate model simulation and benefit society by providing more reliable climate prediction. <br/><br/>A variety of oceanic processes that affect the 'Ningaloo Nio' will be explored in the proposed study including: 1) The impact of the remote forcing from the Pacific Ocean versus forcing over the Indian Ocean on the Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo Nio/Nia;  2) Effects of topographic trapping of westward radiating Rossby waves and their associated downwelling/upwelling associated with Ningaloo Nio/Nia events; 3) The influence of the MJO on Leeuwin current and Ningaloo Nio/Nia via oceanic processes; 4) The role of Australian summer monsoon in affecting the Ningaloo Nio/Nia events. A high-resolution Indo-Pacific basin ocean general circulation model (OGCM) will be employed, which can adequately represent complex bathymetry and topography in the Indonesian Seas. The data from enhanced in-situ observations and satellite data will be thoroughly analyzed and maximally utilized to validate the model. A series of process-oriented OGCM experiments will be performed, to quantify the impacts of remote & local forcing on the Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo/Nio, and identify key processes involved, including the role of coastal Kelvin waves and radiation of Rossby waves. The results will identify the physical processes that determine the sea surface temperature and upper-ocean variability associated with Ningaloo Nio, which can alter atmospheric circulations. In particular, the impacts of Madden-Julian oscillation and the remote forcing from the Pacific on the Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo Nio, which cannot be isolated by observations alone, will be quantified by a series of OGCM experiments. Consequently, completion of the proposed project will substantially advance our understanding of the dynamics of Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo Nio that is major climate variability in the southeast Indian Ocean."

Removal of colonic polyps is performed by a minimally-invasive procedure known as Optical Colonoscopy.  A proper synchronization between CTC for early detection of polyps and OC for their removal is the most effective and economical approach to prevent colon cancer, which has over 97% rate of recovery with early detection. Through a sequence of image analysis steps, a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the colon can be constructed, which is then visualized by radiologists, using a virtual camera, in order to examine the colon surface for abnormalities and polyps.   Visualization involves extraction of the centerline of the 3D colon representation, which is the optimum datum for the virtual camera.  In this project, a quantitative platform for CTC, based on modern computer vision and graphics, is proposed to quantify and improve the visualization process with respect to image resolution, imaging artifacts, colon topology and polyps' locations. Enhancing the detection and classification of polyps in terms of sensitivity and specificity will improve early detection of colon cancer, a major national healthcare concern in terms of mortality and cost. The proposed simulation platform will have applications in biomedical education and training, and in industrial applications for surface inspection and image-based visualization of hidden tubular objects, in addition to computer-aided manufacturing and digital printing.<br/><br/>Visualization in CTC consist of four sequential steps:  i) filtering the CT scan for removal of scanner noise and resolving partial volume effects; ii) segmentation of the resulting images to isolate the colon surface from other structures in the abdomen, which appear in the abdominal CT scan (e.g., the liver, pancreas and small intestines); iii) generation of a 3D colon representation using computational geometry and graphics; and iv) visualization of the 3D representation, by radiologists, using virtual cameras to examine the lumen surface and detect colonic polyps. Each of these steps are based on solid mathematical foundation developed in the image analysis and computer graphics literature in the past two decades. Filtering may be achieved using anisotropic diffusion filtering, whereas segmentation can be achieved by fusion of statistical and variational methods, which separates the colon tissues from the other anatomies and provides a continuous/connected representation of the segmented colon. 3D reconstruction of the segmented colon is performed by common methodologies in graphics such the marching-cube algorithm. Visualization is an elaborate step, which involves generating the centerline of the 3D reconstruction, and a proper allocation of the virtual camera. The centerline may be generated by variational calculus and the level sets method. Common errors in visualization are due to the uncertainties in imaging (e.g., scanner-induced noise, partial volume effects, prep residuals and patient motion) and patient-specific circumstances which may lead to distorted or disconnected colon reconstructions. These errors may obscure the location, shape and texture of polyps, leading to erroneous diagnosis. This project aims at developing a novel simulation for the front-end of CTC, an accurate sensor planning for the virtual cameras. The proposed simulation will provide unique understanding of CTC and will lead to discovery of methods for image-guided interventions to efficiently remove colonic polyps by Optical Colonoscopy and surgical planning for colectomy. The simulation platform will be applicable in biomedical education, training of resident radiologists and healthcare professionals, and will also promote various applications outside the biomedical domain."

This Early Action Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports the development of a new theory and methodology in the social sciences for investigating and understanding communities facing increasing uncertainty about their social and economic future.   Substance abuse is just one manifestation of social stress that characterizes communities where viable futures are increasingly difficult to grasp for large segments of the population.   This project is rooted in the investigator's four decades of anthropological field research in communities in the north Atlantic Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and similar comparative experience in the communities of Robeson County North Carolina.   Both communities have experienced economic and social stress brought about by relocations, factory closures, and natural disasters.  However, the majority of members from each community have experienced and interpreted these events in very different ways.   The insights gained from this project hold promise for understanding the different ways communities experience social and economic uncertainty.  From these insights, the researcher hopes to gain new knowledge about the relationship between these stressors and a vision for a viable future; insights that can inform intervention methods that support community health and well-being. <br/><br/>This award supports a comparative study of communities in severe economic and social stress, seeking to understand the very different ways that the communities themselves conceptualize the causes and consequences both of the stressors and of their very different reactions to social and economic uncertainty.  This research will examine the data from two communities in the north Atlantic Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, with comparative research with two communities in Robeson County North Carolina.  In both places local communities, since the mid-1990s, have experienced major declines in employment and wages, plus declining social support programs.  The researcher points out that there have been locally constructed and fairly intense efforts both to help those who suffer and to mitigate the consequences of social and economic stress, yet the differences persist.  The emphasis in this research begins with seeking to understand the range of responses from community to community.  Using these circumstances as a starting point, the Principal Investigator will develop new theories and methods for the study of ""everyday life histories"" as a means for assessing locally constructed concepts of risk and uncertainty. <br/><br/>The research builds on the concept and methods for studying ""everyday histories"" first developed at the Max Planck Institute for History.  This research project further develops these concepts and methods by a examining of how people have lived and currently live within and against a history that stretches into what they see as an increasingly uncertain future. Toward this end the researcher will be reviewing and reinterpreting decades of his field notes on these communities, and further developing research methods which focus both on socially constructed silences in communities and obstacles to the social recognition of both ""open"" and ""half-hidden"" pleas for help.  The research will contribute not only to a more nuanced and powerful theory of social stress and stressors but has the potential developing a methodology for uncovering the complex relationships between stress as a social phenomenon and the negative behavioral and physical responses to it."

The origin of this platform, the source and composition of the lavas that make it up, and the melting mechanisms that caused its formation are still unknown. This research will analyze the geochemistry of the volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks of a drill core, presently stored at Dalhousie University in Canada, that was drilled through the Bermuda platform back in the 1970's and never analyzed. The research will explore various hypotheses as to the platform's source and origin And it may also have implications for volcanic hazard work and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.  Various theories have been proposed for the origin of the Bermuda platform. One is that it was formed by a mantle plume, which is a hot, long-lived, stationary jet of magma that comes from deep in the mantle and erupts lava onto the seafloor, similar to how Hawaii, Iceland, and the Galapagos islands formed.  Another hypothesis is that the platform was formed by the upwelling of magma as convection in the mantle bumped up against the roots of the North American continent and overturned, causing sustained melting and volcanism that formed the Bermuda Platform. This research is focused on understanding the source of the Bermuda volcanic activity and other similar seafloor volcanic sites around the world that share its characteristics. The work will also provide new clues as to the role this kind of volcanic activity has in the global carbon cycle because some of the samples in the Bermuda drill core appear to have come from a strongly carbonated mantle source. Broader impacts of the research include support of early career scientist from a minority group under-represented in the sciences who has a strong track record of engaging and mentoring both undergraduate and graduate students and providing them with full-bodied research experiences in state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Results of the project will be incorporated into college level courses in addition to being used for public outreach activities and teacher professional development workshops through the Geosciences Museum at Virginia Tech. The project will also foster international collaboration with a Swiss scientist and will rescue an important drill core by moving it to a US core repository where it will be curated and samples will be made accessible to the public and to other scientists wishing to study the Bermuda volcanic platform. <br/><br/>The mantle plume model has generally been accepted as a plausible mechanism behind intraplate volcanism. However, not all locations that are considered hotspots have the seismic and geochemical signatures to support a deep-rooted mantle plume. Small-scale convection (e.g., edge-driven convection, shear-driven convection) has been proposed as an alternative to the mantle plume model, especially to describe the Bermuda swell. This volcanic platform is near a continent, but away from mid-ocean ridges, making it an ideal location to test alternative models for intraplate magma generation. To date, no geochemical, volatile, or petrological data have been published for Bermuda; and this is crucial data to elucidate melting mechanisms and magmatic processes. In 1972, the Bermuda Deep Drill Core was collected and then forgotten. Preliminary geochemical results of samples from this core suggest that some of the Bermuda volcanic units are derived from a carbonated source, indicating the presence of a deep carbon reservoir linked to a highly radiogenic mantle end-member. This research will address fundamental questions of mantle geochemistry and dynamics, such as: (1) how mantle plume and small-scale convection-derived magmas differ from one another geochemically and petrologically; (2) the mantle source composition of Bermuda volcanics; and (3) what the link is between a deep carbonated mantle reservoir and the generation of silica under-saturated magmas and, thus, the role of intraplate magmatism in the global carbon cycle. Geochemical analyses that indicate the temperature of the magma source, the volatile composition of melt inclusions and depth of their formation, and the full suite of major and trace element geochemical analyses of the lavas and their radiogenic isotope compositions will be used to determine the origin and source of the Bermuda volcanics and evaluate the validity of the various proposed hypotheses."

A growing number of applications relies on real-time (time-critical) Bayesian inference, mainly in the fields of wireless communications and imaging. While the most sophisticated algorithms have been designed for time-insensitive tasks, real-time applications typically rely on simplistic methods that prevent the use of accurate system and signal models. This disparity between theory and practice is mainly caused by the fast progress on the theory and algorithm side and the limited theoretical expertise of most hardware designers. The proposed research aims to bridge the ever-growing gap between theory and practice using a holistic approach that spans the circuit design, algorithm, and theory levels. In addition to improving the efficiency and quality of Bayesian inference in real-time applications, the project will advance future wireless systems through collaboration with the telecommunications industry, along with the development of new tools that are accessible to experts on all levels. The interdisciplinary nature of this project is also the unifying theme across the educational outreach activities. The PI will lead hands-on design sessions for underrepresented minority high-school students and will supervise undergraduates from South America with the goal of increasing participation in interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The project builds upon approximate message passing (AMP), a powerful statistical framework that facilitates the design of efficient algorithms and is equipped with analytical tools for characterizing inference complexity and quality. Unfortunately, the theory behind AMP makes it inaccessible to most circuit designers; similarly, the constraints of digital circuit design are generally unknown to algorithm designers and theorists. This project resolves the dichotomy by pursuing a bottom-up research approach in which hardware limitations drive efforts on the algorithm and theory levels. This unconventional research paradigm requires a joint consideration of the major challenges on all levels. In particular, the project evaluates hardware approximations that are key for digital circuit designs, investigates algorithm transforms that enable more efficient architectures, and analyzes the impacts of the proposed circuit-level and algorithm-level optimizations on the inference complexity and quality."

The lifespan of underwater systems varies from a few years to decades, while the spatiotemporal dynamics of underwater acoustic environments at multiple scales pose grand challenges to efficient and reliable acoustic data transmission. The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental and systematic online-learning-based framework for underwater acoustic communications and networking, where the underwater acoustic system 1) models and predicts the long-term dynamics of the acoustic environment, and 2) proactively adapts its communication and networking strategy to the dynamics of the environment, thereby maximizing the long-term system performance in the aspects of energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, and transmission reliability. Through explicit learning about its environment, the proposed framework will allow harmonious co-existence with other acoustic systems, including marine animals, to achieve eco-friendly operation. This project's research will be integrated with education through summer youth K-12 outreach, curriculum development, undergraduate and graduate student training that will be particularly tailored to females and underrepresented minorities, and collaboration with an underwater robotics team from the local Dollar Bay High School. These activities are designed to motivate and better train rural, female, minority, and economically disadvantaged students to pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/><br/>This project tackles fundamental challenges in online-learning-based underwater acoustic communications and networking by innovating across three interrelated domains. First, novel signal processing and sparse learning techniques will be developed to model and predict the large-scale dynamics and the statistical distribution of small-scale fading of underwater acoustic environments, including the acoustic transmission loss, ambient soundscape, and statistical characterization of external (anthropogenic and marine animal) acoustic sources. Second, an optimization framework will be developed, based on the acoustic environment prediction, for joint transmission power control, link scheduling, node-cooperative routing, and autonomous vehicle mobility control to achieve high network utility and harmonious coexistence with other acoustic systems. Third, the acoustic environment exploration-exploitation tradeoff will be tackled in the Bayesian reinforcement learning framework, which will provide a principled approach to weighing the immediate reward of a communication and networking strategy and its associated long-term benefit of revealing the environment's dynamics. Leveraging the geographic advantage of Michigan Tech and the state-of-the-art facilities of Michigan Tech's Great Lakes Research Center, extensive field experiments will be conducted for acoustic measurement collection and for offline and online algorithm evaluation in a software-defined networking architecture.

However, because of the time-consuming nature of pathological assessment, less than 1% of a typical excised node is surveyed and microscopic levels of cancer are liable to be missed. The objective of this work is to rapidly map cancer distribution in surgically excised ""tumor-draining"" or ""sentinel"" lymph nodes using a novel optical imaging technology that could guide sectioning of lymph nodes in pathology so that even microscopic levels of cancer are not missed.<br/> <br/>The approach, named ADEPT (Agent Dependent Early Photon Tomography), combines two methods that serve to provide high sensitivity and selectivity for cancer cells within highly scattering media. First, an infrared-emitting dye perfuse the node, with one dye selectively targeted to cancer cells, while the other is nonspecific, enabling compensation for local variability in dye concentration. Second, pulse excitation  combined with snapshot detection of the earliest photons-to-arrive-at-the detector are counted. To obtain 3-D reconstructions of the internal lymph node volume, the image plane is scanned through the volume. With the appropriate selection of dyes, the approach can be applied to thick tissue (up to 1 cm), with a goal of 100 um image resolution."

Exploration of the cost and mobility trade-offs in spectrum sensing infrastructure will inform efficient end-to-end infrastructure design that minimizes cost while maximizing the learning outcomes of spectrum sensing."

More efficient and cost-effective routes for ERCO2 are needed for technological viability.  In particular, interactions between the electrolyte and the electrocatalyst in ERCO2 cells are largely responsible for the overall performance of the system, yet are not well understood. The project addresses this need by employing a suite of advanced chemical characterization techniques to gain insight for the design of more effective polymer electrolytes and nanostructured catalysts. The project will also increase education and public awareness of the economic and environmental impact of electrochemical processes for converting CO2 to fuels and chemicals.<br/><br/>A combination of in-situ surface-specific spectroscopic, electrokinetic, and isotope labeling techniques will be employed to elucidate the mechanism of the electrode surface-mediated ECRCO2 and its interplay with cations and anions in the electrolyte at the molecular level. Bicarbonate, the most commonly used anion in ECRCO2, is proposed to enhance the reaction rate by increasing the effective CO2 concentration at the electrode surface via the dynamic CO2-bicarbonate equilibrium. Moreover, electrostatically bound cations could reduce the access of reactants to the surface via site blocking at negative electrode potentials. Correlation between the structure of organic cations and the site blocking effect will be established. Insights gained in these mechanistic studies will be used in the design of polymer electrolytes for future ECRCO2 devices. Further, design principles for nanostructured catalysts with minimum transport limitation will be extracted by developing an experimental method to measure the pH, and in turn CO2 concentration, within 10 nm from the electrode surface in-situ.  More broadly, special emphasis will be paid to attracting and retaining students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs via a mobile device based software platform (the ""GreenTech"" app) to provide education and awareness of the need for sustainable and environmentally benign energy utilization."

Theses ejections create shock waves that move outward from the stars, and show up as bursts of signal at low radio frequencies. When these shock waves hit planets around these other stars that have magnetospheres (like the Earth), the planets should also increase in radio signal strength. If we detect this radio emission from a planet, we learn that it has a magnetosphere that can shield the planet from outside radiation and protect any biology that could be present. The investigator will use the Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array radio telescope to search for these signals from 2500 planetary systems continuously over 5 years. This project serves the national interest as it helps our search for planets around other stars that could have life, and our understanding of the properties of these planets.

Similarly, exoplanets with magnetospheres that encounter these shockwaves can also increase in radio luminosity by orders of magnitude. Planetary magnetospheres serve as shields for potential biospheres from harmful high-energy particles from the host star and beyond. The detection of this radio emission at an exoplanet would be very significant, as it allows the direct measurement of the magnetic field strength of the planet, indicating whether the atmosphere of the planet can survive the intense magnetic activity of its host star. The investigator will use the Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) to monitor every stellar system out to 25 parsecs (>2500 systems) continuously for a 5-year period, in an effort to detect such events. As well as providing the first direct confirmation of the presence, strength and extent of an exoplanetary magnetosphere, a detection allows inference of the nature of the exoplanet?s interior and provides the capability to characterize physical properties such as planetary rotation rate and inclination of rotational and orbital axes. The investigator will work with high school students from the Pasadena Unified School District to develop a publicly accessible, web-based, live update of the low frequency radio sky, as seen by the OVRO-LWA.

This project will test the thermoregulation hypothesis, which suggests that the width of the human pelvis is limited by the need to maintain a narrow body that is good at staying cool. Human ancestors evolved in warm climates and engaged in strenuous activities, and a narrow body aids in temperature regulation. Skeletal data on pelvic dimensions and temperature regulation data from living people will be collected to address the thermoregulation hypothesis. These data may also be informative for predicting women at risk of obstructed labor and for preventing overheating in recreational and professional athletes. Additionally, this project will support STEM training for two female undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in science. Project results will be shared in local high schools and with the general public at the American Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>The traditional explanation for the ""obstetrical dilemma,"" which asks why the modern human female birth canal has not expanded to make birth easier, is that a narrow pelvis is more efficient during bipedal locomotion. However, the thermoregulation hypothesis, which suggests that a narrow pelvis aids in thermoregulation during physical activity, has been discussed as a competing hypothesis. This research will investigate the potential role of thermoregulation in constraining the evolution of the birth canal. The investigators hypothesize that a narrow pelvis aids in thermoregulation in modern humans during physical activity, that hip breadth is correlated with the area of the birth canal, and that Homo erectus was a narrow-bodied, heat-adapted taxon. The investigators will collect thermoregulation data from runners to determine if a narrow pelvis bestows thermoregulatory advantages during exercise; measure female pelvic dimensions using three-dimensional scans created from eco-geographically varied populations; and reconstruct the KNM-WT 15000 H. erectus pelvis, which is controversial because the original reconstruction provides the only evidence of a hominin with a narrow pelvis prior to the evolution of Homo sapiens. These data will contribute to a broader understanding of the evolutionary reasons behind obstructed labor."

Indeed, many salient SDN features --- central control and programming interfaces --- are enabled by principles from the fields of programming language, operating systems, and distributed systems.  While these principles have produced a variety of programming abstractions that drastically improve networking practice, reducing the complex distributed protocols to simpler centralized programs, there is little consensus on what are the right abstractions. Moreover, network architects today need to combine heterogeneous data sources --- network forwarding rules, data flow and QoS metrics, host intrusion alerts, and so on --- to produce a cohesive view of the network and investigate problems. To tackle the challenging network abstraction and integration problem, this project will explore the computing principle --- a principle blessed with decades of fruitful theories and commercial success, yet surprisingly under-investigated in SDN --- of database.<br/><br/>This database-defined network project builds on the perspective that SDN control fundamentally revolves around data representation, where the entire SDN network is under the hood of a standard SQL database, relying on SQL for flexible and extensible network abstraction, and leveraging the database integration techniques for combining multiple control applications into a coherent forwarding behavior. In achieving this ambitious goal, this project will first develop a novel database-centered controller platform that address two unique networking challenges not found in classic database applications: (1) the system extensibility requirement to accommodate an enlarging body of control applications; and (2) the performance requirement to cope with very fast data-plane updates under complex control applications. In addition, the controller platform will be enhanced with data integration component to manage dependencies between control applications, addressing the long-standing problem of integrating control applications --- combining a collection of potentially overlapping and conflicting modules into a coherent network forwarding behavior.<br/><br/>The results of the project will yield solutions to multiple problems, including an attractive form of evolvable SDN abstractions and automated coordination between controls applications. All the abstractions and coordination facilities will be exposed to application programmers, network engineers and architects via the broadly familiar SQL interfaces. Thus, the project is likely to be valuable both technically and as a way to encourage more rapid uptake of SDN. The project will integrate the theoretically-grounded research methodology and content of this proposal with education by developing a graduate-level 'Computing principles in software-defined networking' course.  Informed by the analysis and comparison of the various fundamental approaches (e.g., database, distributed system, programming language) to prominent SDN problems of abstraction and integration, the project will also result in a survey paper on computing principles and SDN."

Though comprising one of the largest refugee groups worldwide, migration and refugee studies have largely ignored Afghans and Afghanistan. Also, Afghan conceptions of kin networks conceive of relatedness as both inclusive and beyond immediate blood relationships to larger ethno-linguistic, tribal, religious, and national communities. By investigating the practices and labors through which Afghans forge relations in spite of conflict, loss, and death, this research will contribute to theories on violence and chronic insecurity as they affect the families. Moreover, by attending to the Afghan family, this research will explore the often elided consequences of conflict to investigate refugee kinship and Muslim communities in Germany. Lastly, this research will foster greater interest in the academic study of Afghanistan through teaching and publications, as well as encourage collaborative partnerships between diverse actors engaged with emigrant communities."

The Walvis Ridge, which is now located off of Africa, also formed near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge close to the same time. The Rio Grande Rise is about twice the volume of Walvis Ridge and together they record ~130 Myr of intra-plate volcanism and are hypothesized to represent the products of a deep mantle plume. Despite its extremely large size and prolonged volcanic history, Rio Grande Rise truly is terra incognita. Based on the few rock samples available, it appears that Rio Grande Rise formed between 70 and 90 million years ago at the same time as the older part of Walvis Ridge. To understand the history of these large volcanic features, this project will carry out a seagoing cruise to the Rio Grande Rise to survey and collect rock samples from 40 seamounts, rift zone valleys and steep escarpments. These new data will allow a thorough investigation of the formation of the Rio Grande Rise and its relationship to the Walvis Ridge where rock samples have already been collected.  The new data will also provide a unique opportunity to address a wide range of questions relating to plate tectonics, including how the Rio Grande Rise is related to the deep dense mantle zone of the African large low shear wave velocity province (LLSVP) which is thought to be a place where mantle plumes are generated.  This project is in collaboration with Brazilian scientists and students. The project supports the training of U.S. graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The newly collected geochronological, geochemical and geophysical data will contribute significantly to the following two major science questions: (1) Is Rio Grande Rise shaped by plume dynamics, shallow tectonics or both and what are the consequences for understanding hotspot evolution? (2) What are the mantle sources related to the deep dense mantle zone of the African large low shear wave velocity province (LLSVP)?  Determining when Rio Grande Rise and Walvis Ridge volcanism became associated with intra-plate hotspot volcanism alone is fundamental as these volcanic traces are essential for calculating African absolute plate motion and global plate circuit models back to 130 million years. Moreover, if the large volume of the Rio Grande Rise-Walvis Ridge system and its source link back to the edge of the LLSVP, this will provide a unique possibility to investigate whether their extreme enriched composition represents a major component in the lower mantle."

However, neuromorphic hardware lacks general and efficient inference and learning models of the type that empower artificial neural networks, while being compatible with the spatial and temporal constraints of the brain. This research will bridge isolated fields of machine learning and neuromorphic engineering, and address the energetic and performance merits of computing under physical constraints on communication, precision, retention and failures.

A fundamental step in understanding the eruption of seafloor lavas, which are mostly basaltic in composition, and the nature of their mantle source is to establish the budget and distribution of volatiles in these rocks. This is because volatile elements and compounds, like Carbon, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Chlorine, Sulfur, and H2O and CO2, respectively, influence mantle melting, magma crystallization, and the location, strength, and composition of volcanic eruptions. The abundance and volatile composition of seafloor-erupted lavas and their spatial distribution provide important constraints on models of mantle flow and temperature, on the dehydration of oceanic lithosphere subducted into the mantle during the subduction process, on lithospheric metasomatism, and on the cycling of elements between Earth's surface and deep reservoirs. The lavas erupted along the Chile Ridge in the southeast Pacific Ocean are unique in that they show geochemical characteristics of arc lavas, instead of seafloor basalts. This research examines the chemistry of these unusual lavas and provides a comprehensive characterization of their composition including major and trace element geochemistry, their cargo of volatile elements and compounds, and their ratios of the radiogenic isotopes of Strontium, Neodymium, Hafnium, and Lead.  These data will be used to unravel the role of the different reservoirs and processes contributing to the generation and evolution of Chile Ridge magmatism as well as provide important constraints on models of mantle flow and temperature. Moreover, volatiles are key constituents of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans and, thus, these data can also be used to establish the cycles of volatiles between the Earth's interior and surface which fundamentally affects our planet's habitability.  Broader impacts of the work include support of an early career research scientist, support of an institution in an EPSCoR state (i.e., a state that does not receive significant federal monies) and engaging undergraduate students in the full research experience, including training in state-of-the-art geochemical analytical techniques.

It also supports NSF-funded analytical facilities at Brown University in Rhode Island and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and funds an investigator from a minority group under-represented in the sciences. <br/><br/>Lavas from the slab window on the Chile Ridge, in the southeast Pacific Ocean, come from a region characterized by a unique set of geological and geochemical characteristics: (1) it has no geophysical evidence for a mantle plume affecting the ridge due to its location away from any known Pacific Ocean Basin hotspot; (2) it is one of the few known locations in the world where the ridge axis is currently being subducted resulting in the development of a slab window under the South American continent; and (3) it is one of the few examples in the world where mid-ocean ridge basalts have geochemical characteristics more commonly associated with arc magmatism. This research provides a comprehensive geochemical study of these unique Chile Ridge basalts, providing a unique opportunity to study the interaction between subduction and mid-ocean ridge spreading processes.  An important clue to the origin of these unique volcanic rocks is their volatile content and its composition. This research will fully characterize primitive submarine glasses by analyzing their major, trace, and volatile element contents, the radiogenic isotope ratios of Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf of these rocks, and the composition and distribution of volatile elements and compounds (C, H, F, S, Cl, H2O, and CO2). Analyses will be carried out using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry at Brown University. The volatile work will be done via secondary ion mass spectrometry at the Woods Hole Institution of Oceanography to analyze the composition of olivine-hosted melt inclusions in samples that represent the end-member basaltic compositions of the targeted Chile Ridge lavas. The new geochemical data will be used to unravel the processes contributing to the generation and evolution of different end-member components forming the southeast Pacific upper mantle."

An image --- which only captures 2D spatial variations --- is poorly equipped to unravel these interactions and infer properties of a scene including its shape, reflectance, and its composition. This is especially true for scenes that have sharp reflections, refractions, and volumetric scattering. This research models interactions of light with scenes using light rays and their transformations. The central hypothesis underlying the research is the idea that problems of shape, reflectance and material composition estimation are often simpler and well-posed when they are studied using light rays and their transformations. A wide-range of real-world objects and scenes stand to benefit from progress made in this research; this includes scenes with complex configurations that lead to inter-reflections,  objects with shine, specularities, and spatially-varying reflectances, as well as objects that are transparent, or translucent. A diverse set of applications including machine vision, microscopy, and consumer photography stand to benefit from this research. The education and outreach components of this project disseminates image processing research in the broader Pittsburgh area via camera building workshops and lab demos for middle/high-school students, and professional development courses for physics teachers.<br/><br/>The focus of the research is to develop novel acquisition and processing methods for scene understanding by studying characterizations of light that go beyond images. In particular, the research analyzes the properties of two signals: the plenoptic function, which captures spatial, temporal, angular, and spectral variations of light, and the plenoptic light transport, which captures how light propagates through a scene. The central hypothesis of the research is that the plenoptic function and light transport provide a rich encoding of how light interacts with a scene; hence, unlike image-based inference, plenoptic inference can be fundamentally well-conditioned even for scenes that interact with light in a complex manner.  To this end, the research develops novel low-dimensional models for plenoptic functions that are based on physical laws governing interaction of light with a scene. The research also builds novel computational cameras that acquire light propagates in a scene by decomposing into light paths of varying complexity, and subsequently estimating the 3D shape, reflectance, and material composition."

This symposium particularly seeks to connect women and other underrepresented minorities in similar fields of mathematics or statistics from universities in the New England area, as well as to promote collaboration and share strategies for addressing issues facing these groups. However, the symposium is more broadly inclusive, and hopes to benefit a larger community. The symposium is open to everyone, regardless of gender identity. The symposium will feature two plenary talks, in applied dynamical systems and geometric group theory, three tutorials, including one on public key cryptography, and one in data science, short talks by students (graduate and undergraduate), post-doctoral fellows and faculty, a poster session, and a panel on effective mentoring. A meeting of members of AWM (Association for Women in Mathematics) Student Chapters will also be convened during the symposium. The symposium seeks to have a broad representation from pure, applied and industrial math, and encourages participation from researchers in all areas of mathematics, applied mathematics and statistics.<br/><br/>This pan-New England symposium will serve to build bridges between universities and connect researchers, particularly upcoming and younger researchers, women and underrepresented minorities, in similar mathematical fields. The geographic proximity of these universities makes it more likely that networks formed at the conference can be sustained and strengthened, which in turn should increase the probability that these researchers stay in the field and become highly productive members of the community. The symposium lays a strong emphasis on vertical integration, namely having representation at all levels, from undergraduate students to faculty, as we believe this is particularly beneficial to achieve the objectives of the symposium.<br/><br/>The symposium website is: http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/aah/WINRS/index.html"

Conventional compressive sensing techniques fail to achieve satisfactory performance in IoT and especially wearable applications due to the lack of prior knowledge about signal models and the overlook of individual variability. The research goal of this CAREER plan is to develop a data-driven and hardware-friendly IoT framework to fundamentally address the unmet energy efficiency need of IoT and especially wearable applications. This will be accomplished by a systematic approach that seamlessly integrates compressive sensing and data analytics in compressed domains using deep learning methods. The proposed research will provide a transformative IoT framework that significantly reduces the data size for transmission from sensors to cloud while improving the overall quality of information delivery and bringing signal intelligence closer to users. The research outcomes will directly impact a variety of IoT applications, such as long-term environmental sensing for monitoring the airborne quality, radiation, water quality, hazardous chemicals, and many other environment indicators, by allowing compressive sensors to be deployed in energy-constrained environments to perform precise information acquisition over a significantly increased time span impossible with existing technologies. The proposed framework will also advance wearable technologies to enable important progress in transforming the existing healthcare model from episodic examination for disease diagnosis and treatment to continuous monitoring for disease prediction and prevention. This will make our healthcare systems more effective and economic and improve the overall quality of living for billions of individuals. The PI will take advantage of his affiliation with the I/UCRC Center for Embedded Systems at ASU to engage industry sponsors to accelerate technology adoption and transfer to benefit the society at large. The PI also plans to undertake an ambitious education program to actively engage and impact a diverse population of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students to take away the PI?s research and create more values for the community in the long term.<br/><br/>The specific research objectives are to 1) formulate problems and develop efficient solvers to construct binary near-isometry embedding matrices to enable effective data compression on sensors through compressive sampling; 2) train deep neuron networks to decode information directly from the compressive samples for on-chip data analytics; 3) prototype the proposed framework in wearable hardware and evaluate the system performance over a variety of physiological signals. The research outcomes will allow future IoT devices to precisely sense and transfer the information of interest specified by users in an energy-efficient manner rather than recording imprecise data in raw forms as in existing approaches. The findings from this research will advance the theory development of data-driven compressive sensing by filling the current knowledge gap on how to design near-isometry embedding matrices with binary constraints that are essential for cost-effective hardware mapping. It will also uncover the intrinsic connections between compressive sensing and deep learning by establishing a viable data analytics solution for decoding high-level information directly from compressive samples. On the integration of research and education, the PI will enhance the current curriculum to better prepare students for careers in both industry and academic. The PI will take advantage of the FURI program at ASU to engage undergraduate students in research to foster their interest and motivation to pursue graduate degrees. ASU has one of the largest Hispanic and Native American student populations in the nation. The PI will make strong personal efforts to encourage the recruitment, retention, and advancement of the underrepresented groups. The PI will also collaborate with the Fulton Engineering Education Outreach office to initiate an exciting high school teacher training program, which aims to increase the level of literacy and interest in STEM fields of a large body of high school students through advanced coursework development."

It crystallizes directly from magma, and hence can be found in Earth's mantle, magma chambers, lava flows, explosively-erupted volcanic products, and meteorites. Recent studies have shown that olivine crystals from all of these settings contain a dendritic core enriched in phosphorus (P), an element typically not abundant in olivine. This finding challenges the conventional understanding of mantle and volcano dynamics, and meteorite formation. Because the shape and chemical composition of crystals are sensitive to the conditions of crystallization (e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical composition of the magma), the presence of a dendritic, P-rich core in olivine represents an important but not yet fully understood feature of the mineral. Through laboratory experiments, including real-time observations of crystal growth, and micro-to-nano-scale analyses of composition and structure of olivine, the work in this proposal strives to advance the scientific understanding of how magmas are cooled and crystallize, both in Earth's interior and in space.<br/><br/>Previous dynamic crystallization experiments have shown that dendritic P-rich olivine can be obtained through rapid growth when a magma is cooled rapidly. In this project, the range of experiments is extended to magmatic processes operating at slow cooling rates, which are more realistic for environments at depth. The set up of these experiments will promote rapid olivine growth through (1) a thermal gradient (mimicking the cold margins of magma chambers and meteorites) and (2) magma superheating and nucleation delay (e.g. by adiabatic decompression or flash heating). Experiments will be carried on in 1-atm, gas-mixing furnace and heating stage microscope, and the experimental products will be analyzed using optical microscopy, field-emission gun electron microprobe and transmission electron microscope. X-ray distribution mapping of P in the experimental products will determine the minimal driving forces (smallest thermal gradient and smallest superheating) for the formation of P zoning as seen in olivine worldwide and in other planetary bodies. The TEM investigations will document the microstructure of olivine P zoning and bring new insights on the incorporation and accommodation of P and other incompatible elements in the lattice. Heating stage experiments will allow direct observation of the effect of thermal gradients and melt superheating on the growth of olivine. They will also enable new growth rate measurements in a mafic ocean island basalt melt. Measurements of the dendrite arm spacing in all the experimental products will allow construction of a reference growth chart to estimate the growth rates of natural crystals from their crystal morphology or the texture of their P-rich zones. These experiments will complete pre-existing datasets and will address topics fundamental to crystallization kinetics in melts and frontiers in olivine crystal growth. The results will be relevant to volcanic, plutonic and extraterrestrial systems. The project bridges the fields of mineralogy and petrology, requires advanced materials characterization, and is strongly relevant to igneous petrology."

These data sets often contain intrinsic, nonlinear, low-dimensional structure hidden in complex high-dimensional input representations.<br/>  To uncover such structure one needs to adapt to local changes in scale, recognize multiscale structure, represent the intrinsic space underlying the data, compute with coarse approximate distances, and integrate heterogeneous data into meaningful distance functions. There is a need for algorithms and data structures that can search, represent, and summarize such data sets efficiently.  The PI will develop new data structures, models of computation, sampling theories, sampling algorithms, and metrics for addressing these challenges.<br/>  <br/>  The specific aim of the project is to adapt hierarchical metric data structures to work with locally adaptive distances using new models of computation that only use approximate distance comparisons.  These models acknowledge the reality that with sufficiently complex data, even a single distance computation can be expensive.  A second specific aim is to develop new multiscale sampling theories as well as new algorithms for computing such samples.  These samples and sampling algorithms will be applicable to a wide range of problems and will extend and generalize greedy and farthest-point strategies.  A third specific aim is to develop algorithms for new metrics and distance functions for heterogeneous data to more accurately represent intrinsic structure in data.  These algorithms will generalize methods used in both Voronoi refinement mesh generation and topological data analysis.<br/><br/>  The project will make geometric methods applicable to a much wider range of problems and with that comes the need for wider understanding of advanced geometry and topology.  The PI will integrate research and education, introducing computer science students at both the undergraduate and graduate level to foundational ideas in spatial data analysis, from geometry to topology.

They exhibit large increases in strength compared to larger-scale bulk constituents. In some cases, they display increased ductility, high radiation damage tolerance, shock resistance, and thermal stability; thus showing great potential for applications in a variety of fields. These materials can lead to new performance levels and energy efficiency not achievable with current materials and thus can have a significant economic impact. However, a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control the properties of metallic nano layered composites severely limits our current ability to process and tailor them. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to advance fundamental knowledge, develop computational tools and provide design guidelines for metallic nanolayered composites with exceptional controllable properties. Results from this research have the potential to enhance U.S. competitiveness within the markets of aerospace and electronic devices. As part of this project, the research results will be made available to other researchers and the general public through publications and active participation in conferences and workshops. With the aim of educating the twenty-first century workforce, this work also increases the exposure of high school students to science and technology concepts through outreach programs, and provides invaluable educational opportunities for student researchers to collaborate with National Laboratories.<br/><br/>This research is to develop a new experimentally-validated multiscale-modeling approach to elucidate the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of metallic nanolayered composites. The specific research objectives are: (i) to explore the influence of dislocation-interface interactions on the strength of metallic nanolayered composites; (ii) to investigate the effects of the interface structure and layer thickness on the ductility and plastic instability; (iii) to identify the roles of interface structure and material properties of constituents in the texture evolution during the accumulative roll bonding process; (iv) to reveal the microscopic mechanisms for cyclic deformation behavior of metallic nanolayered composites. The research results will provide insights into the interaction between dislocations and interfaces and their interplay with macroscopically applied fields. The seamless integration of the multiscale-modeling approach and experiment studies will allow one-to-one comparisons between fundamental defect models and deformation experiments on nanostructured materials, creating a unique opportunity for testing the applicability of state-of-the-art theories of crystal defects in real materials systems."

The focus is on the Athabascan villages of Beaver and Artic where many elders who have lived a subsistence lifestyle reside. Studying Gwich'in forestry management in the Gwich'in language will provide an understanding of the human-environment interaction as a way to create more opportunities for co-management. This project will advance knowledge about forestry management for natural resources managers, and add to the growing body of regional work to promote Indigenous knowledge practice and sustainable management of natural resources. While this project incorporates ideas as well as approaches from current forestry and languages projects, it is also creating new information. This information will provide reliable/tested forestry practices for those interested in the incorporation of Indigenous Knowledge into natural resources management, and will be shared with other villages. The opportunity to establish a Gwich'in forestry practices approach is missing in co-management as well as adaptive management between Indigenous and non-Indigenous agencies. Using management as one of the focal points of this project, the project will document the endangered Gwich'in language in a manner that is not archival, but alive.  <br/><br/>This project represents the application of a newly developed model for research, the co-production of scientific knowledge, bringing established forestry management science research together with Gwich'in knowledge holders in order to produce a more contextualized and holistic understanding of the boreal forest. The study will be the first to document Gwich'in forestry practices in a collaborative social and linguistic science investigation. Considered an endangered language, Gwich'in elders who are both fluent speakers and have lived a subsistence lifestyle will be interviewed in the Gwich'in language as a means to communicate complex seasonal management practices of the boreal forests. For this study, language is the vehicle to understand the deep place-based relationship Gwich'in people have with the forests. The core research question centers not only on how Gwich'in people practice forestry management but also on how their relationship to the forests change or evolve seasonally. While this project will not exhaust the discussion, the intention is to accomplish three objectives: 1. Demonstrate the usefulness of Gwich'in forestry knowledge and practices, 2. Record Gwich'in in this context and, 3. Provide a way forward in the co-management of the Alaska's interior boreal forests. Given the objectives, the potential contributions and implications of this study span a number of natural resources co-management opportunities: fire suppression and arctic boreal encroachment, as well as environmental change preparation-adaptation-mitigation."

Initially, this single atom microscope will capture and count the number of magnesium atoms produced in collisions of neon and helium atoms.  Detailed measurements of these rare collisions will help explain the origin and abundance of copper, silver, and other heavy chemical elements.  Because the single atom microscope will increase the sensitivity of these types of measurements by at least a factor of one hundred, laboratory experiments that mimic the conditions inside of stars where these elements are produced will be possible for the first time.  In parallel, the PI will develop a modular planetarium program that describes how the chemical elements are formed inside of stars. These modules will be presented within the context of a virtual tour of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, which emphasizes how research being conducted at the Lab impacts our understanding of this process and how this research is beneficial to society.<br/><br/><br/>The primary research goal of this project is to develop and commission a single atom microscope for measuring rare nuclear reactions that are relevant for nuclear astrophysics. The recoil products will be captured within the noble gas solid and then optically detected using resonant laser excitation and single photon detectors. A single atom microscope designed for magnesium, when coupled with a recoil separator, would allow for measurements of neon-helium nuclear fusion reactions with at least a hundred fold improvement in sensitivity.  These reactions play a key role in the production of neutrons that drives the slow neutron capture process (s-process) inside of massive stars, which is responsible for the creation of about half of the heavy elements between mass 60 and 90 including copper and silver.  Steps for this project include demonstrating optical single atom detection of ytterbium in solid neon, calibrating the efficiency, sensitivity, and selectivity of the technique, and finally building and commissioning a single atom microscope for measuring the nuclear reactions that produce magnesium atoms. Critical steps include a detailed understanding of the optical backgrounds produced by impurities in the various optical components, optical spectroscopy of ytterbium and magnesium in solid noble gases, and the design of a high light collection efficiency diffraction-limited optical imaging system."

Successful completion of the project will result in an improved understanding of what causes heart diseases. The educational and outreach of this CAREER program have been designed to benefit high school teachers and stimulate long-term interest in K-12 students towards science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>Cardiac ischemia, including acute myocardial infarction (MI, ?heart attack?) and chronic ischemic heart disease (chronic IHD), are highly progressive biological disorders that can ultimately lead to catastrophic heart failure and death. Hypoxia has been implicated as the major regulator of ischemia-induced cardiac injury, through triggering of a multitude of molecular and cellular signaling cascades, leading to contractile dysfunction and adverse remodeling of the myocardium. While the pathophysiological responses of the heart, specifically during MI, have been the subject of intensive studies using gold standard animal models, the lack of precise control over the microenvironmental cues and the inability to fully recapitulate human physiology have led to a major knowledge gap in biological understating of ischemia-induced cardiac injury. This CAREER program aims to meet the critical need for the development of an alternative platform technology that addresses the limitations of current in vitro assays and has translational advantages over animal models. The goal of this five-year program is to develop a native-like three dimensional (3D) myocardial tissue model on-a-chip and mimic ischemia induced cardiac diseased conditions to provide a fundamental framework on the underlying complex biological and pathophysiological events following injury.  Insights derived are expected to open new avenues for the development of enabling technologies to elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms governing ischemic heart disease. Additionally, the proposed study has the potential to advance multimodal pharmacological based therapies for repair and regeneration of the heart in particular, and other complex organs/tissues, in general. The educational and outreach of this CAREER program have been designed to benefit high school teachers and stimulate long-term interest in K-12 students towards science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The proposed initiatives will also provide interdisciplinary training for the next generation of undergraduate and graduate students in STEM fields. Furthermore, this CAREER program will bring collaborative synergy among bioengineering scientists and clinicians in cardiovascular medicine."

This improvement will simplify the deployment of smart vision applications in automotive, sports and entertainment, consumer, robotics and machine vision, medical, and security/surveillance domains. Through a unique and energy-efficient hardware computation platform, automated hardware design for machine learning applications, and efficient implementation libraries, this project will improve both the feature set and efficiency of smart vision applications across a wide range of end-use cases. With the rapid growth in smart vision applications, this project will be a key enabling technology to support high-performance, energy efficient and scalable solutions. Internet of Things (IoT) applications promise to produce billions in revenue and trillions in global economic impact through improved efficiency, safety, energy, and labor costs. Wide deployment of customized computing in IoT applications will lead to substantial energy savings, and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions, and a more sustainable growth model for deployment of intelligent sensor systems with thousands or millions of sensor nodes analyzing large volumes of input data.<br/>The proposed project focuses on the design of high performance, energy-efficient IoT computer vision platforms, design tools, and implementation libraries. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive design and implementation platform to meet performance and energy goals; however, there are two main challenges to their adoption (1) small FPGAs are cost-effective but insufficient to replace the efficient, low-cost ASICs for computation-demanding applications; large FPGAs can fulfill all computation demands, but are too expensive to meet IoT price points, and (2) design and development for FPGAs is challenging and require hardware design expertise. This project?s innovation targets these challenges. First, our proposed platform will combine a media ASIC for efficient video processing with a small cost-effective FPGA for custom machine learning. Second, our proposed domain specific high level synthesis will generate efficient machine learning accelerators for standard machine learning infrastructures quickly, limiting required hardware design expertise while out-performing general purpose design techniques. This project will leverage background expertise in hardware design, design tools, and machine learning to develop and demonstrate the advantages of hybrid computation platforms for smart vision applications in terms of performance, energy consumption, cost and physical size."

The primary objective of this research project is to understand how morphological diversity in dimorphic structures has evolved. This objective addresses two fundamentally important but largely unanswered questions in developmental and evolutionary biology: (1) How do changes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) result in morphological diversity? and (2) How might GRNs bias such evolutionary change? A major hypothesis is that some genes, called ""hot-spot"" genes, are involved repeatedly in morphological evolution, perhaps due to their central positions in GRNs. The research project will test this ""hot-spot"" hypothesis using a model structure, the nematode tail tip, which has repeatedly evolved dimorphism. This research will not only add to the understanding of fundamental evolutionary mechanisms, but will aid in the understanding of morphogenesis, a fundamental process in development, cancer metastasis and wound healing. New knowledge is also expected regarding genes that govern gender differences and control the timing of developmental events. Broader impacts include the training of new graduate and undergraduate students in developmental genetics, genomics and evolution. Because such students will be recruited from diverse pools, the participation of women and underrepresented minorities is likely to be enriched in this scientific discipline. In the course of this research, new resources (gene constructs, strains and databases) and novel methods (tissue-specific analysis of gene expression) will be generated and shared, likely to be useful to others researching morphogenesis and cell biology. Finally, a unique living, curated collection of diverse nematode species will be maintained as a valuable resource for comparative biology, genomics and education.<br/><br/>The tail tips of both males and females of many rhabditid nematode species (as well as the rhabditid ancestor) have a pointed morphology, but male-specific tail tip morphogenesis (TTM) producing a rounded shape has been repeatedly gained and lost during evolution. Two different approaches will be used to test the ""hot-spot"" gene hypothesis for the evolution of TTM dimorphism: a candidate-gene approach and an unbiased genomics-level approach. First, DMD-3, the ""master-regulator"" of TTM in Caenorhabditis elegans, will be tested as a candidate ""hot-spot"" gene. smFISH will be used to determine if DMD-3 is expressed in males from phylogenetic lineages that independently evolved TTM. Bayesian methods will be used to test for any phylogenetic correlation between changes in DMD-3 expression and TTM dimorphism. If such correlation exists, the functional requirement for DMD-3 will be tested by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or RNAi. The second approach will use phylogenetic analysis of tail-tip-specific transcriptome profiles to identify any other genes that changed expression in concert with TTM evolution. RNA-seq profiles will be obtained for tail tips that have been laser-dissected from males and females at several stages from L3 through L4. For each species, these profiles will identify tail tip genes that are dynamically expressed between L3 and L4 stages, differentially expressed between the different genders, and correlate with the gain or loss of TTM in the phylogeny."

Depending on the frequency of the hurricanes and concurrent extent of the wind damage and salt water intrusion, coastal forests can be significantly damaged and may transition into salt water marsh. With a more variable climate system, hurricane return times will decrease and projected increasing sea level rise will enhance the opportunity for salt intrusion. Current understanding of hurricane effects is based largely on the effects of a single hurricane; few studies exist that document effects of repeated storms in one location or that separate the effects of storm surge from wind. In October 2016 Hurricane Matthew hit the South Carolina coast in largely in the same area affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, thus providing an opportunity to study multiple hurricane impacts on the same coastal forests. Hurricane Matthew differed in intensity and areas inundated with salt water. The project will introduce newer remote sensing capabilities to expand the studies to understand the short term and long term impacts on structure and functioning of the affected forests and at larger landscape and regional scales. This project's timely field assessments of wind damage, salt stress, soil chemistry, tree functioning, and tree establishment coupled with the remote sensing will test theoretical predictions and advance understanding of large infrequent disturbances on coastal forests. <br/><br/>Large infrequent disturbances may structure forest ecosystem responses for very long periods of time and may trigger threshold responses that cause multiple paths of ecosystem response or even shifts in complete ecosystem structure and function. Much of the theory devoted to hurricane disturbance effects on coastal forest ecosystems arises from the study of single hurricanes or immediate response following the hurricane. Empirical tests and data are needed to evaluate multiple hurricanes across short and long time and site to regional space scales to fully understand the recovery and trajectories of change. This project leverages data and research sites from a long-term field study of coastal ecosystems to examine the consequences of the Hurricane Hugo on the recovery from wind throw and salt stress. The new studies will examine how wind damage and the salt intrusion from Hurricane Matthew affected soil processes, forest mortality and succession, forest functioning, and invasion of non-native species in response to differential hurricane disturbance. The remote sensing will assess forest structure, stress, phenology, and plant traits across the marsh/forest landscape and at multiple study areas along the coast of South Carolina. This work will provide critical tests of disturbance theory, succession, ecosystem structure and function across multiple space and time scales."

One way they do this is by observing what happens when counter-rotating beams of protons collide. The characteristics of the debris produced in the collisions can reveal the basic physics of fundamental particles and the forces between them. Highly sophisticated particle detectors and analysis methods are required to measure these characteristics. NSF provides funding to US researchers to conduct research in experimental high energy physics using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world?s premier laboratory for this research. In addition to directly supporting research activities, NSF will provide, via this award, funding to twelve US universities to maintain the operation of US-supplied components of the ATLAS detector and its supporting software and computing systems, carry out technical planning and development that will enable future enhancements to ATLAS?s detection capabilities, and promote science education and outreach. The Large Hadron Collider is located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva Switzerland.<br/>US participation in ATLAS will stimulate the development of a scientific and technically educated workforce, advancing the multidisciplinary application of technology, and the popularization and dissemination of science to the general public. The award will support activities that provide opportunities to develop and maintain complex detector apparatus, custom analog and digital electronics and software systems for data management, data processing and technical analysis. Technical professionals are required to perform many of these tasks, increasing the expertise of the US work force. The operation of existing detector components, design of upgrade components, and related research activities create opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration among university physics personnel, university personnel in engineering departments, and physics department technical personnel as  physicists, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and computer scientists work with post-docs and students. Similarly, physics personnel will work closely with computing professionals at their home institutions and at national laboratories to support the various software and computing activities.<br/>Technical part: This award supports the development and operation of the instrumentation and analysis tools that are essential to studying debris from proton-proton collisions. These tools are essential for answering basic, foundational questions, such as ?What is the origin of mass of the elementary particles?? The Higgs Boson discovery, a physical manifestation of the mechanism that generates elementary particle masses, led to the 2013 Physics Nobel Prize that was awarded to Peter Higgs and Francois Englert. Is that the end of the story, or are there other, as-of-yet undiscovered, contributions to this process?  Other fundamental questions, equally important, may have answers that depend, at least in part, on the physics observed through the continued operation and analysis of data obtained from the LHC. ?What is the dark matter that accounts for 25% of the mass of the universe? Can dark matter be produced and observed at the LHC? Can evidence of extra dimensions predicted in some models be found at LHC energies? Are there particles with exotic properties, unlike any forms of matter observed so far, whose existence is predicted by some theories that extend the standard model of elementary particles??  In each case, answering the question requires the aggregation of large amounts of data from which to draw meaningful statistical inferences."

We know from previous research that acoustic markers can enable and inform sociocultural and ecological relations. But the question remains as to what extent municipal planning and regulation of noise can transform how cities are managed. As the fastest urbanizing area of the world, the global south functions as a laboratory for exploring the role of sound in urban development. Institutions such as the World Bank, UN-Habitat, and Cities Alliance have declared secondary cities the future drivers of the global economy, taking special interest in guiding the orderly development of such cities in the global south. Therefore, understanding how acoustic factors may or may not promote resilience will be critical for achieving goals of sustainability. <br/><br/>Duke University doctoral candidate, Joella Bitter, supervised by Dr. Louise Meintjes, will undertake 13 months of ethnographic research in order to investigate linkages between noise complaints, urban sound knowledge and practice, and municipal planning in a context of rapid urbanization. The research will take place in Gulu, Uganda, one of the 14 aspiring secondary cities receiving support from World Bank-funded urban infrastructural development programs. Since urbanization occurs not only as a result of these official development efforts, but also through the daily activities of urban residents, the research methods will be focused on participant-observation research with planning experts, audio producers, and transport mechanics, audio recording and mapping of Gulu's urban soundscape, and group listening sessions to discuss raw and edited soundscape recordings. By focusing on both technical and vernacular evaluations of sound across these groups, this research engages the social practices that inform and facilitate the trajectory of urbanization and promotes dialogue between residents, cultural leaders, and policy makers. This research therefore provides tools with which to practically rethink city planning in Africa and beyond."

This technology is expected to provide significant improvement in urban air quality and combat ozone at the source. The educational plan will simultaneously advance scientific discovery and increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pipeline, as well as equip engineering students at Kansas State University (KSU) with skillsets for innovative and successful careers in nanotechnology.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to integrate nanotechnology and heterogeneous catalysis to fabricate well-tailored and multifunctional CNT-based composites for environmental remediation. The PI will test the broad hypothesis that photocatalytic activity and photoresponse of CNT-supported TiO2 nanocomposites (CNT/TiO2) are enhanced by the properties of CNTs and resulting interfacial charge transfer properties. The research goal will be achieved by pursuing the following specific tasks: 1) scalable synthesis of highly uniform CNTs [metallic single-walled CNTs (m-SWCNTs), semiconducting SWCNTs (s-SWCNTs), and multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs)] using an industrial waste gas from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis as a feedstock; 2) controlled CNT functionalization and coupling of CNTs and TiO2 using UV light and a green solvent (H2O2); 3) elucidation of the coupling mechanisms between CNTs and TiO2; and 4) evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of CNT/TiO2 in the oxidation of NOx under various environmental and material variables. This study will illuminate the coupling mechanisms between TiO2 and CNTs and establish structure-property-function relationships. The work is a novel means for maximizing charge-separation efficiency of TiO2 and extending its photoresponse to the visible-light region. The resulting s-SWCNT/TiO2 photocatalyst will provide a transformative pathway for the synthesis of visible-light-active, low-cost, efficient, and large-area CNT-based/TiO2 coatings for the photocatalytic oxidation of NOx. Creation of a scalable and controlled CVD synthesis approach for s-SWCNTs and m-SWCNTs that are orders-of-magnitude higher than conventional post-purification methods will be transformative, as it is a necessary first step for scalable synthesis of well-tailored SWCNT/TiO2 photocatalysts. The use of UV/H2O2 for CNT functionalization during TiO2 deposition will ensure that electrons are freely shuttled along the CNTs; this approach differs from conventional approaches, which largely involve the use of aggressive acid treatment that imparts significant defects on CNTs. The resulting structure-property-function correlations of CNT/TiO2 photocatalysts will substantially improve understanding of the coupling mechanisms and lay a solid foundation for the adoption of the nanocomposites in a number of photocatalytic applications including water splitting, air purification, CO2 reduction, water purification, and microbial inactivation. The international exchange program will benefit both research and education at KSU, as US students will gain valuable global perspective--a critical skill for an engineer in the 21st century."

Prior research suggests that natural variability in the oxytocin system affects neural systems involved in social cognition. This proposal examines whether more efficient oxytocin utilization increases sensitivity to social information. Increased sensitivity may confer an advantage when social information is relevant but may be disadvantageous in other contexts. Findings from this project are expected to provide new information about how people who differ in the way their neural systems are sensitized by this hormone respond to social information.  The results will be broadly applicable to multiple disciplines spanning molecular, neural, and behavioral investigations, and may inspire new research in these disciplines. The experiments conducted are expected to provide valuable research opportunities and unique training combining molecular genetics and functional neuroimaging for students interested in psychology, cognitive science, and neurosciences. <br/><br/>Oxytocin receptors (OXTR) allow the body to respond to oxytocin, but its expression differs between people. These receptors are under epigenetic control, specifically through DNA methylation, which is at least in part responsible for these individual differences. OXTR methylation has been associated with brain activity supporting social cognition and with various social phenotypes in both healthy and disordered populations. Combing this reliable, endogenous epigenetic marker with functional magnetic imaging and behavioral testing, this proposal tests the hypothesis that the endogenous oxytocin system influences the degree to which an individual is sensitive to social information. Its main aims are (1) to test whether variability in OXTR methylation is associated with differential engagement of perceptual and attentional systems during social information processing; (2) to evaluate whether individuals low in OXTR methylation depend on prefrontal brain systems to suppress irrelevant social information; and (3) to assess whether the relationship between OXTR methylation and neural systems supporting attention to social information predicts self-reported sociality and independently rated social skill."

A goal of the plastics and agricultural industries is the design of biodegradable plastic mulch films that can be tilled into the soil, where degradation is on the order of years. Biodegradable plastics are designed to disintegrate, with the help of microorganisms, into carbon dioxide, water, and methane. However, the process inherently requires plastic fragments ranging from macroscopic to molecular level to be formed en route to mineralization. The goal of this project is the assessment of effects of these plastic fragments in soil ecosystems which is largely unknown.<br/><br/>The PIs aims to: 1) produce and characterize pure polymer films using polymers relevant to those used in agricultural mulches, describe their degradation products, and optimize methods for measuring and quantifying degradation products in soil and aqueous media. 2) use aflatoxin, a common and economically important natural toxin found in agricultural soils, in a proof-of-principle study to ask whether natural toxins have potential to adsorb and accumulate on fragments of biodegradable plastics in soil. The fungus that produces aflatoxin, Aspergillus flavus, is a frequent and avid colonizer of starch-based biodegradable plastics, and, 3) query whether the fungus is attracted to the starch polymers or the biodegradable plastic polymers, or both. The PIs will assess global gene expression of A. flavus during growth on biodegradable plastics because, besides aflatoxin, it produces other secondary metabolites that are potentially toxic in the soil food web. The ability to analyze in situ polymer degradation will allow realistic modeling of the fate of biodegradable plastic mulch films in soil ecosystems. This study would represent the most thorough comparison of the degradation characteristics of commercially-relevant polymers in real soil under realistic conditions yet reported the literature. Understanding the interaction of Aspergillus flavus and aflatoxin with biodegradable polymers will aid in generating biodegradable plastic formulations used in agriculture and food packaging that are less likely to become contaminated with aflatoxin. Assessing genes expressed by Aspergillus flavus during growth on biodegradable polymers will reveal whether, and which of, the many hydrolytic enzymes produced by Aspergillus flavus are involved in polymer breakdown. In addition, altered expression of secondary metabolite genes would support further experiments to assess the potential for aflatoxin and other microbial metabolites to adsorb to biodegradable plastic mulch film fragments - sequestered from their natural roles, and concentrated onto particles that may enter the food web. Since the fall of 2011, ten WWU Biology and seven WWU Engineering undergraduate students have gained 1-2 years' research experience on the biodegradable plastics project. Of those, five students were coauthors on peer-reviewed publications. All of these students have gone on to research jobs in their field of interest, graduate programs, or medical school. Two undergraduate researchers trained on this grant would have the advantage to focus full-time on their projects because they will be paid stipends. They will receive training in interdisciplinary research methods, attend joint laboratory meetings, and present their data at a university-level conference (Scholars Week). The results from this work will be relevant to agroecosystem and human health. The ability to analyze in situ polymer degradation will allow realistic modeling of the fate of biodegradable plastic mulch films in soil ecosystems and pave the way for studies of fate and transport of polymer degradation products in soils."

The focus is on the Athabascan villages of Beaver and Artic where many elders who have lived a subsistence lifestyle reside. Studying Gwich'in forestry management in the Gwich'in language will provide an understanding of the human-environment interaction as a way to create more opportunities for co-management. This project will advance knowledge about forestry management for natural resources managers, and add to the growing body of regional work to promote Indigenous knowledge practice and sustainable management of natural resources. While this project incorporates ideas as well as approaches from current forestry and languages projects, it is also creating new information. This information will provide reliable/tested forestry practices for those interested in the incorporation of Indigenous Knowledge into natural resources management, and will be shared with other villages. The opportunity to establish a Gwich'in forestry practices approach is missing in co-management as well as adaptive management between Indigenous and non-Indigenous agencies. Using management as one of the focal points of this project, the project will document the endangered Gwich'in language in a manner that is not archival, but alive.  <br/><br/>This project represents the application of a newly developed model for research, the co-production of scientific knowledge, bringing established forestry management science research together with Gwich'in knowledge holders in order to produce a more contextualized and holistic understanding of the boreal forest. The study will be the first to document Gwich'in forestry practices in a collaborative social and linguistic science investigation. Considered an endangered language, Gwich'in elders who are both fluent speakers and have lived a subsistence lifestyle will be interviewed in the Gwich'in language as a means to communicate complex seasonal management practices of the boreal forests. For this study, language is the vehicle to understand the deep place-based relationship Gwich'in people have with the forests. The core research question centers not only on how Gwich'in people practice forestry management but also on how their relationship to the forests change or evolve seasonally. While this project will not exhaust the discussion, the intention is to accomplish three objectives: 1. Demonstrate the usefulness of Gwich'in forestry knowledge and practices, 2. Record Gwich'in in this context and, 3. Provide a way forward in the co-management of the Alaska's interior boreal forests. Given the objectives, the potential contributions and implications of this study span a number of natural resources co-management opportunities: fire suppression and arctic boreal encroachment, as well as environmental change preparation-adaptation-mitigation."

PULSE is a national network of current and former department chairs and administrators from a variety of institutional types. The PULSE Fellows seek to catalyze improvement in undergraduate life science education through promoting adoption of the recommendations in the Vision and Change Report (2011). This important report highlights that biology students are more successful when they learn underlying organizing concepts, rather than an accumulation of facts and information; when they develop important skills such as effective communication of ideas, designing experiments and interpreting data; when they learn in classrooms that engage them actively in the process of constructing their own understanding; and when they have the opportunity to participate in high impact practices such as undergraduate research or internships. Despite this wealth of data, most biology departments have not embraced this approach, but progress is being made. PULSE has already worked with over 180 institutions since 2013 and seeks to expand this number significantly over the next few years.<br/><br/>The next PULSE workshop will be held at HHMI Headquarters in Chevy Chase, MD and will include approximately 50 PULSE Fellows, invited experts in institutional change and effective teaching and learning, and several facilitators. The goal of this meeting is to ensure that PULSE's multiple programs are well coordinated for maximum effect and that they will be assessed appropriately to identify interventions most effective in catalyzing improvement in undergraduate education. The PULSE project seeks to promote department-wide change in educational practices. PULSE works with departmental faculty, including departmental leaders, to help them reach consensus about their vision. PULSE is also testing theories of change by assessing the long-term impact of its activities on changes in departmental pedagogies, curriculum, and co-curricular programs. By establishing which types of interventions are most effective at motivating sustained change, the project will enhance understanding of change strategies that advance the goal of better teaching and learning in life sciences and across STEM. PULSE's agenda will be measurably promoted by an in-person meeting of Fellows to coordinate their activities, to plan for transition to a financially self-sustaining organization, and to further integrate newer Fellows into the organization's programs. With the goal of tipping the balance in biology departments toward adoption of best educational practices, PULSE's programs have the potential to accelerate the reform of undergraduate biology education nationwide.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences.

It will impact climate, energy, air and water quality and livability. This will be achieved through more effective and efficient management of the urban forest by municipalities, and through more and better organized citizen participation. Trees are a valuable asset for a community. Their benefits include: a reduction in energy use; improvement in air and water quality; increased carbon capture and storage; increased property values; and an improvement in individual and community well-being. To ensure maximum benefit and minimum cost, street trees need to be managed efficiently. In order to do this, municipalities need up-to-date inventories of trees. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to automatically generate inventories of street trees from aerial and street-view imagery using cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning techniques. The inventory contains each tree's GPS location, its species, trunk diameter and an estimate of its health. The inventory is updated every time a new aerial or street-view image becomes available. Both tree detection and tree species classification are unprecedented applications based on combining the learning capabilities of deep convolutional networks, 3D geometry, and large annotated datasets that are collected by a combination of experts and crowdsourcing. This innovation makes it possible to maintain an always up-to-date, accurate, complete, US-wide street tree inventory at a fraction of the current cost."

Two of the challenges facing such systems are locating data quickly and cost-efficiently, and enforcing cooperative node behaviors. Social network-based approaches seek to build social networks into data sharing systems in order to leverage the real-world friend properties of mutual trust and common interest. Although these approaches can significantly reduce cost and complexity compared to purely technical approaches, current methods only make use of a very superficial level of social network properties, and cannot support the broad goal of enabling all nodes to share data freely and efficiently. This project addresses these shortcomings through more fully leveraging social network properties, and coordinating social network-based approaches with technical approaches. Areas of investigation include infrastructures for data searching, cooperation enhancement mechanisms, and algorithms for data server selection. <br/><br/>Today, a multitude of large-scale distributed systems use the Internet to deliver a variety of data -- such as software and audio/video content -- to end users. These systems support many social, commercial, and cultural activities. Millions of dollars are spent on commercial servers to deliver this data. Peer-to-peer technology, in which user computers cooperate to share content between themselves, has potential for doing this cheaper and faster. However, wider use of peer-to-peer technology is held back by several limitations. One is that nodes may misbehave, selfishly receiving content but not contributing in return, or distributing corrupted or malicious content into the system, to be further spread by unsuspecting users. Another limitation is that locating content is difficult, due to the wide distribution of nodes and the lack of a central index. This project seeks to address these limitations by making use of information obtained from social networks. Potential benefits of the work include savings in the costs of infrastructure and energy consumption for data distribution. The project also provides educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and collaborates with other educational programs for under-represented student recruitment, and outreach to K-12 students."

A key component of this proposal is answering questions word-by-word: this forces both humans and computers to answer questions using information as efficiently as possible.  In addition to embedding these skills in question answering tasks, this proposal has an extensive outreach program to exhibit this technology in interactive question answering competitions for high school and college students.<br/><br/>This research is possible by a new representations of entities in a medium-dimensional embedding that encodes relationships between entities (e.g., the representation of ""Goodluck Jonathan"" and ""Nigeria"" encodes that the former is the leader of the latter) to enable the system to answer questions about Nigeria.

Yet translating algorithms and ideas into code is no easy task, and mistakes can be costly. A bug in a script can invalidate scientific results, and a bug in a file system can cause catastrophic loss of data. This project makes programming easier for systems programmers and scientists alike, through a novel approach to programming that automates domain-specific languages (DSLs) with solver-aided tools for program verification and synthesis. The intellectual merits are to advance knowledge in programming support for domain-specific verification and synthesis, in co-design of languages and tools, and in applying solver-aided programming to new domains. The project's broader significance and importance are to extend the reach of solver-aided programming by orders of magnitude and to thousands of programmers, facilitating new applications with societal, educational, and industrial impact.<br/><br/>The project's key idea is to make verification and synthesis tools, which are usually hand-crafted by computer science PhDs, as simple to build as DSLs, which are developed by a broad spectrum of programmers. The PI's prior work on solver-aided languages has demonstrated that this is possible, enabling a wide range of programmers, from professional developers to high-school students, to rapidly construct synthesis and verification tools for a variety of domains, from radiation therapy software to low-power computing to K-12 education. The resulting tools are based on reduction to Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving, and as such, rely on technology that is (1) fundamentally intractable and (2) requires years of experience and training to use effectively. The goal of this proposal is thus to address the central challenge of solver-aided programming: enabling non-experts to diagnose and optimize the performance of solver-aided tools. To achieve this goal, the project develops automatic techniques for (1) symbolic profiling to provide diagnostic information about the causes of scalability bottlenecks across the solver-aided stack; (2) symbolic optimization to mitigate the identified scalability bottlenecks via code refactoring, (meta)sketch mining, and combination of solving engines; and (3) applications to serve as new challenge problems for evaluating symbolic profiling and optimization, and as demos for attracting a diverse population of users, from computer architects to education experts."

The neural crest and cranial placodes are temporary structures in growing embryos that together build all the nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord, such as the nerves that control the gut, the sense organs enabling our senses of smell, hearing and balance, and also the eye lenses, much of the skull, some cells of the teeth, and all skin pigment cells. The conference sessions will discuss the evolutionary origins of these essential structures, and how they work during development to form these different types of cells and organs. The NC&CP GRC is held in a setting that allows scientists at all levels to discuss problems and advances in studying these embryo structures.  The program will also allow opportunities to mentor young scientists of all backgrounds, including an informal forum to discuss the professional growth and challenges women face in science, and a Graduate Research Seminar organized and run by junior scientists. This seminar enables junior researchers to present their data in an informal, peer-group setting, so they gain confidence and camaraderie, and includes a faculty-led Career Mentorship Panel discussion, ""The Different Faces of Academic Research.""  A diverse set of speakers has been assembled, with 19 further talks, selected from submitted abstracts, to be presented by women, under-represented minorities, and junior researchers.<br/><br/>The Neural Crest and Cranial Placodes Gordon Research Conference (NC&CP GRC) uniquely considers two distinct embryonic cell types, the neural crest and the cranial placodes, that have traditionally been studied separately. These embryonic structures together contribute to a wide variety of cell types during development, including the entire peripheral nervous system, sense organs, pigment cells, the craniofacial skeleton, and teeth. Neural crest and cranial placodes are derived from adjacent domains within the early ectoderm and their initial patterning is influenced by coordinated signals. They provide integrated, experimentally tractable systems for investigating a broad array of fundamental questions in cell, developmental, evolutionary, and systems biology. Study of neural crest cells has pioneered the understanding of fundamental properties of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions as well as cell migration, and has been instrumental in defining general stem cell properties across numerous tissue populations. The use of systems biology methods to construct the gene regulatory networks that control vertebrate development has been pioneered in the study of neural crest and cranial placodes. The emergence and diversification of the neural crest and cranial placodes is thought to have been critical for vertebrate evolution. This conference will bring together a diverse group of scientists in a collegial atmosphere to foster substantive discussions and promote collaboration. It will accelerate the exchange of information across different model systems, include an evolutionary perspective, promote technological innovations, and advance understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms governing the formation, cellular behavior, and differentiation of these two critical embryonic populations."

This is a particularly relevant problem as batteries perform multiple tasks in each application (e.g. driving, recharging, grid services, etc.) which can contribute to its aging differently. Furthermore, batteries not only perform multiple tasks in a single application, but migrate to a second application as a second life battery. This CAREER proposal aims to understand battery aging dynamics as context-dependent and to provide a unified theory and modeling that can link context events and lives with cell and module aging events. This will benefit all battery applications and the emerging battery repurposing sector by providing tangible methods to improve battery testing, estimation and management. As educational components, this project will propose new hands-on distributed laboratory capabilities for undergraduate and graduate students to explore battery technologies in the context of grid and vehicle applications. Outreach includes hosting female Hispanic students through the Michigan College and University Partnership, and also participating in the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineering mentoring and conferences.<br/><br/>Batteries are subjected to highly uncertain scenarios depending on their context, present cell to module and pack variations due to its space and function distribution and different monitoring capabilities at different scales. This CAREER proposal will consider that these conditions are comparable to ecological systems, such as fishery, forestry, etc. and that battery lifetime and aging should tackle the multi-scale and multi-life problem under ecological approaches and methods. For this, testing methods will include low-cost large-scale distributed testing that will experimentally probe individuals and populations of batteries across context variations and different lives. Data from these tests will be used to develop probabilistic reasoning networks to link causality for battery aging and will provide the ability to establish monitoring and data needs across lives. To formulate the battery aging and life modeling, the proposal will focus on studying intraspecific trait variations (variations inside a species) that arise from battery aging. For this purpose, populations of batteries will be identified through the establishment of a patch hierarchy to identify the structure and functional distribution of intraspecific trait per patch at the individual, sub-population and population level. The intraspecific traits will be modeled for each patch using individual-based, mixed models and integral projection models that are used in ecological systems to model population variations. These approaches will provide a probabilistic model across the population. However, as battery populations are monitored at different scales (pack and cells sparsely depending on the technology), the models will consider incomplete data availability and develop scaling ladders. These ladders will scale the intraspecific trait models from individuals to populations and vice versa to adapt to different data availability and mixed approaches. These models will be implemented in battery management systems to learn the traits models from scavenged data. Trait filters will also be formulated and deployed to identify and model internal and external factors that will determine the trait variations for each life. The models and ecology-based theory obtained will be experimentally validated through the large-scale population testing and real electric vehicle and grid-scale battery deployments."

Because iron is both necessary and harmful, the amount, location and form of iron within an animal must be tightly controlled. In humans and other mammals, the physiological processes that provide the right amount of iron at the right times are partially understood. However, in insects and other invertebrate animals, these processes have not yet been discovered. The goal of this research project is to understand how iron is transported from one cell to another in insects using the fruit fly as a model system. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. Knowledge gained from this research will provide a framework for future studies of iron transport in blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes, which must cope with a seemingly toxic amount of iron when they ingest a blood meal. A potential outcome of this project is the discovery of a more evolutionarily ancient iron transport mechanism that functions not only in insects but also in other invertebrate animals. In addition, information learned from this research may provide insight into the less-understood mechanisms of iron transport in humans. Finally, because insect management strategies rely on information about insect biology, the results of this project may contribute to the development of a new insect control strategy. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to understand the physiological mechanisms of iron transport in insects. Four models that describe possible mechanisms of iron transport into cells will be tested using Drosophila melanogaster as the model insect species.

Seaweeds represent an important resource with a wide range of uses in the food, cosmetic, and fertilizer industries. They are also attracting increasing attention as a source for biofuels that do not compete with terrestrial plants for food production. The project utilizes advanced high resolution synchrotron radiation methods to define the precise locations and chemical states of iron, iodine and boron in two important seaweeds and uses this information to assist in determining the biological importance of interactions between them. This work also provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in a wide range of important techniques.  In addition, since San Diego State University has a high minority population (10th largest grantor of minority bachelor's degrees in the USA), this research project is thus expected to favorably impact minority training in the sciences. Outreach activities are also in progress.<br/><br/>While in the cytoplasm many metalloproteins are present as a complicated mixture not easily amenable to simple analysis without prior potentially destructive, and certainly disruptive, isolation and purification.  Many other metalloproteins are stored, sequestered or localized in discrete locations within the cell/organelles and are also difficult to isolate and study. As the resolution and flux density of synchrotron radiation (SR) increases, it may be possible to pinpoint such systems and analyze and characterize them directly in situ without need for isolation or purification. Thus, one goal of this research is to see what the limits are for SR methods for visualizing the chemical state, localization and potential interactions of trace elements as applied to biological samples given the increasing capabilities of 3rd generation synchrotrons where significant progress (both in terms of brilliance and resolution) has been evident. The project is using utilizing advanced high resolution (micron to submicron) SR methods, i.e. microprobe, 3D tomography, IR/Raman, XANES and EXAFS to define the precise locations and chemical states of iron, iodine and boron in two model marine macroalgae (Ectocarpus siliculosis, Macrocystis pyrifera).

In the face of uncertainty, decision makers cannot observe probabilities directly and must instead base their choices on subjective beliefs. These beliefs are often expressed as subjective probability judgments (SPJs), and their quality is constrained by the knowledge of the individuals who hold them. Consequently, decision making under uncertainty requires that decision makers account for the quality of the judgments at their disposal. In many of the areas that concern us the most (e.g., health, safety, and the protection of the environment), however, decisions often hinge on the likelihood of single events such as the success of a surgery, the growth of a mutual fund, or the melting of the polar ice caps. As a result, evaluating SPJs is either impractical or impossible in many areas of decision making. To circumvent this issue, research on judgment under uncertainty has often been forced to evaluate SPJs relative to (a) laboratory situations in which base rates or relative frequencies are known; (b) sets of judgments for which probability theory demands some qualitative ordering or relationship; or (c) the observed outcomes of uncertain events. Thus, while informative, the extensive body of research on judgment under uncertainty is often of little use to real-world decision makers when attempting to identify their best course of action, ex ante. This dissertation develops a method for assessing the quality of SPJs when benchmarks (e.g., base rates, outcomes) are unknown. <br/><br/>Specifically, the present research develops a method for measuring the degree to which an individual's SPJs tend to agree with the optimized, aggregate ""wisdom of the crowds"", also known as credibility. To do this, we will conduct several probability forecasting tournaments and regress each individual's SPJs on optimized aggregates, calculated using methods developed by the Good Judgment Project. The estimated parameters of these models are indices of an individual's bias; expertise; and acuity (measured as the standard error of the regression) in subjective probability judgment. This work improves upon previous methods for assessing uncertainty in at least two ways. First, the credibility framework developed here can be used to evaluate SPJs when normative benchmarks (e.g., base rates, outcomes, repeated measurements) are unavailable or unknown. Second, preliminary evidence suggests that modeling judgments in this way can provide decision makers with an empirical method for correcting ""errors"" and ""biases"" in subjective probability judgment. Additionally, because predictions in domains such as military intelligence, climate science, and epidemiology tend be highly uncertain and errors prohibitively costly, decision makers in these domains may benefit from even marginal gains in their ability to evaluate SPJs. The present research facilitates this evaluation by providing straightforward measures of a source's quality, independent of empirical outcomes. In doing so, this research improves the quality and evaluability of decision making across a wide variety of domains."

To reshore jobs, improve operations, and recruit, retain, and retrain skilled workers, companies are increasingly using robotics technology. Ideally, robots will not replace humans but team with them to improve productivity. However, most industrial robots are poorly integrated into human workflow, causing expensive work stoppage problems ($1.7M per hour), worker stress, and talent loss.  The research goal of this project is to address this problem by designing novel methods to improve human-robot workflow and productivity in assembly manufacturing through the use of an intelligent material delivery system (IMDS), which will closely integrate with and support the manual work process. This project will investigate innovative, multi-disciplinary approaches to this research area, dramatically advancing the state-of-the art in smart manufacturing and human-centered robotics. <br/><br/>The research team will make the following contributions to human-centered smart service systems: 1) Revolutionize the use of robotics in assembly manufacturing processes to closely support skilled human workers, enabling them to focus on tasks they value (their trade) as opposed to tasks that distract from their talent (material movement). 2) Dramatically improve the productivity and flexibility of factories through nimble, real-time scheduling of an IMDS system that dynamically incorporates real-time models of human workflow. 3) Deeply explore the socio-technical implications of having an IMDS system in the workplace, in terms of human workers' cognition, fatigue, affect, and job satisfaction. The project's approach serves as a direct contrast to industry state-of-the-art, which relies on strict bifurcation of human and robot work, and rigid delivery schedules that fail to take local trim-line variations into account. By closely integrating an IMDS into the manual work process and understanding worker and material status, the project will readily enable flexibility and reconfigurability of a human workforce, an absolute necessity in made-to-order, small-batch manufacturing settings. <br/><br/>This project will help the US manufacturing sector dramatically improve their operations by using automation to directly support a talented, skilled workforce. It has the potential to impact all major US manufacturing sectors, including automotive, construction, healthcare, energy, and goods. It will help US companies reshore operations, as well as create new opportunities for US worker STEM skill acquisition.

The material system under study is expected to overcome several issues associated with copper interconnects. This material system will make it possible to fabricate nanoscale interconnects that possess low electrical resistance and high mechanical strength to provide a robust next generation of nano-interconnects. Utilizing advanced micro/nanofabrication processes, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will be grown inside through-silicon vias (TSVs) and a copper matrix will be added to enhance the density, strength and conductivity of the CNTs.  Electrical resistance of individual vias and daisy-chained vias will be measured and an analytical approach will be used to determine the preferred path of current and obtain insights on interface resistance of copper and CNT bundles. Mechanical strength will be investigated through bend tests and thermal expansion of wafers containing TSVs while the electrical resistance of TSVs will be monitored for resistance variation for failure detection. Finite element simulation will be used to verify and calibrate the experiments. Mechanical and thermo-mechanical fatigue durability will be examined. <br/><br/>Interconnects are an essential component of any electronic system. In particular, TSVs are key interconnects necessary for fabrication of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs). Therefore, advancements in the area of interconnects will enhance three dimensional (3D) integration of complex electronic devices. If successful, this research will result in a new material system that is capable of resolving several performance and reliability issues that exist with copper interconnects today, such as high resistivity at very small dimensions and electromigration. The research conducted in this study will lead to new directions taken in the manufacturing and fabrication of micro/nanoelectronic devices and systems by facilitating miniaturization of sub-systems and providing a path for a high-yield, high-volume manufacturing process.  Outreach activities include a college workshop for K-12 students, the recruitment of women and minorities into the research program in collaboration with the University of Alabama's LSAMP Program, and participation in an REU Site."

During courtship, the unusually colorful male Habronattus jumping spiders engage in elaborate dances that showcase movements, colors, and patterns to prospective mates. Although females react to these displays by changing where they face, we know almost nothing about where females look during courtship, or how male displays function to manipulate female gaze. To understand how these displays have evolved to capture and retain female visual attention, this research program will use newly available eye tracking technology and digital tools to examine interactions between male displays and female gaze in the Fiery Haired Jumping Spider, Habronattus pyrrithrix. The research team will then expand their work to 20 additional Habronattus species to understand broader patterns of display evolution. This research program will allow us to better understand how animals communicate through complex visual displays and how evolution shapes complex signals. In addition, the scientific team will use insights from their research to enrich educational collaborations with community partners. These partnerships include the development and implementation of curricula for regional public schools, as well as biomimicry-themed ""superhero summer camps"" and afterschool programming in collaboration with Assemble, a Pittsburgh-based non-profit organization which focuses on teaching inner-city youth about science by integrating art into science education.<br/><br/>One widespread feature of visual systems is distinct regionalization of visual competency across the visual field, including regions of heightened motion sensitivity, spatial acuity and/or color vision. Animals compensate for this regionalization with movements of the head or eyes that aim specialized retinal regions at areas of interest within the visual scene. These gaze movements determine what animals see when they interact with visual stimuli. However, despite the fundamental importance of gaze to animal vision, we know almost nothing about how animals use their gaze to evaluate communicatory displays. We know even less about how visual displays have evolved to effectively capture, retain or manipulate the gaze of signal receivers. This research will build upon current understandings of the coevolution of visual signals and visual systems by evaluating the evolutionary relevance of gaze-display dynamics for diversification of male courtship displays in Habronattus spiders. The research will employ gaze-tracking, video playbacks, and digital and physical manipulations of male displays to reveal basic properties of gaze-display interactions in the species Habronattus pyrrithrix. Leveraging insights derived from these in-depth studies, the research will use comparative approaches to test broader hypotheses regarding the evolution of gaze-display interactions across the genus Habronattus."

Global society requires citizens and a workforce that are literate in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), but many U.S. students remain ill prepared in these areas. At the same time, the children who fill U.S. classrooms increasingly speak a non-English home language, with the highest concentration in the early grades. Many young children are also at risk for lack of school readiness in language, literacy, mathematics, and science due to family background factors. Educational efforts to offset early risk factors can be successful, with clear links between high quality early learning experiences and later academic outcomes. SciMath-DLL will help teachers provide effective mathematics and science learning experiences for their students. Early educational support is critical to assure that all students, regardless of socioeconomic or linguistic background, learn the STEM content required to become science and mathematics literate. Converging lines of research suggest that participation in sustained mathematics and science learning activities could enhance the school readiness of preschool dual language learners. Positive effects of combining science inquiry with supports for English-language learning have been identified for older students. For preschoolers, sustained science and math learning opportunities enhance language and pre-literacy skills for children learning one language. Mathematics skills and science knowledge also predict later mathematics, science, and reading achievement. What has not been studied is the extent to which rich science and mathematics experiences in preschool lead to better mathematics and science readiness and improved language skills for preschool DLLs. Because the preschool teaching force is not prepared to support STEM learning or to provide effective supports for DLLs, professional development to improve knowledge and practice in these areas is required before children's learning outcomes can be improved.<br/><br/>SciMath-DLL is an innovative preschool professional development (PD) model that integrates supports for DLLs with high quality science and mathematics instructional offerings. It engages teachers with workshops, classroom-based coaching, and professional learning communities. Development and research activities incorporate cycles of design-expert review-enactment- analysis-redesign; collaboration between researcher-educator teams at all project stages; use of multiple kinds of data and data sources to establish claims; and more traditional, experimental methodologies. Based on initial evidence of promise, the SciMath-DLL project will expand PD offerings to include web-based materials, making the PD more flexible for use in a range of educational settings and training circumstances. An efficacy study will be completed to examine the potential of the SciMath-DLL resources, model, and tools to generate positive effects on teacher attitudes, knowledge, and practice for early mathematics and science and on children's readiness in these domains in settings that serve children learning two languages. By creating a suite of tools that can be used under differing educational circumstances to improve professional knowledge, skill, and practice around STEM, the project increases the number of teachers who are prepared to support children as STEM learners and, thus, the number of children who can be supported as STEM learners."

While there have been many initiatives to increase the representation of underrepresented minority faculty, systematic efforts have not been designed to address the completion of doctoral degrees amongst this population. Data show that students, particularly underrepresented students, are leaving before obtaining a degree because of the long, arduous, and uncertain road to graduation. These data also suggest that individuals, graduate schools, and society would benefit from efforts to reduce time-to-degree and degree completion rates. Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to offer a practical and timely experience particularly for underrepresented doctoral students in engineering (African American, Native American, Pacific Island and Hispanic American) to address issues germane to shortening time-to-degree and degree completion rates. The specific aims are to: 1) conduct research to understand the motivational factors that promote and detract from degree progress and 2) to develop and offer the Dissertation Institute (Institute) to provide underrepresented doctoral students in engineering with motivating, helpful strategies for avoiding pitfalls that prolong completion times, particularly those at the dissertation proposal preparation and dissertation completion stages. Current efforts to support underrepresented doctoral students have tended to be local opportunities within specific programs or universities. This project is different from existing efforts because it will systematically examine and positively impact the motivational factors that promote dissertation completion across multiple sites to consider and incorporate contextually relevant factors such that the Institute is transferable across contexts and not limited to local implementation. This transferability is critical to developing a sustainable future program to support underrepresented students. This project addresses strategic goals of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and critical needs of the nation related to enhanced global competitiveness and an improved national economy.<br/><br/>This project is grounded in the expectancy-value theory of motivation and will result in two sets of outcomes: research outcomes and direct benefits to participants. Using quantitative and qualitative research methods, the research outcomes will include: 1) contextually relevant and nationally representative research-based data we can use to inform the Institute's design regarding the success beliefs and values that contribute to and detract from students' dissertation success, 2) measures of Institute effectiveness in terms of participant's increased beliefs about succeeding in and the value of completing a dissertation, and 3) a list of variables to which academics should pay attention when designing transferable versions of the Institute. To achieve the outcomes of our study, we have designed a multi-method, multi-phased study. We will examine and draw on stakeholder needs to develop an Institute that is consistent with literature suggestions and effective practices but also contextually relevant for participants. Finally, we will comparatively analyze the data across sites to allow us to identify the key elements on which we should focus in considering transferability of the Institute to additional sites and/or through online means. The research will directly impact approximately 170 underrepresented doctoral students and will contribute to the long-term sustainability of other Institute models. In addition to improving basic writing habits and skills, Institute participants will gain practical strategies for: 1) distinguishing between behaviors that foster or hinder success, 2) increasing engagement in positive behaviors and eliminating destructive behaviors, 3) developing plans to maneuver through the dissertation phase from selecting a topic to completing the dissertation, and 4) establishing realistic program completion goals and plans for implementing those goals. As a result of participation, students will gain specific skills in synthesizing and evaluating findings from the literature to aid in developing a dissertation proposal or for writing a dissertation. They will learn how to identify helpful, credible resources (people, physical and online) and how to use them effectively. Participants will also learn about developing and writing conference papers and publishable manuscripts from the dissertation, an important part of being ready for future employment. In combination, the project outcomes will have immediate impacts on participants while setting the stage for longer-term benefits."

Due to their expressive power, in recent years regular expressions have been adopted in pattern-sets used for these applications in both industry and academia. Existing high-performance regular expression matching engines are based on finite automata, and are implemented using either logic- or memory-based designs. The former allow peak performance on single packet flows with relatively simple logic, but are not scalable to large numbers of flows; the latter offer scalability in the number of flows at the cost of algorithmic and design complexity. Despite the rich body of work in the area, providing worst-case guarantees is still challenging in the presence of complex regular expressions that include repetitions of wildcards and large character sets. Moreover, existing solutions assume that packets are inspected in-order and after data decompression. <br/><br/>This project will develop a language abstraction, data structures, and algorithms for line rate deep packet inspection. In particular, the project will consider open problems in regular expression-based deep packet inspection, namely: (i) handling of complex patterns containing repetitions of wildcards and large character sets, and (ii) inspection of out-of-order packets and compressed traffic. A language-based approach to deep packet inspection will be introduced in order to handle the regular expressions? complexity.

The PI will leverage the MU Undergraduate Research Program to involve undergraduate students in the proposed work, which will allow students to work at the intersection of three domains: algorithm and data structure design, system architecture and networking applications. The results of this research will be disseminated through publications and presentations, and by releasing open-source software modules on the PI?s Lab website."

This project exploits a novel optimization framework to efficiently design and implement resilient analog/RF systems. The framework is based on recent results optimization theory, and is expected to find the optimal design both efficiently (i.e., with low computational cost) and robustly (e.g., with guaranteed global optimum). The project would apply this technique to optimize resilient analog/RF systems that are composed of tunable analog/RF circuits, on-chip sensors and on-chip controllers. Hence, the proposed framework offers a novel infrastructure for analog/RF design enabling radical improvements."

In addition, decision makers are often required to consider multiple and conflicting performance criteria when faced with such problems.  Despite their ubiquity and wide-ranging impact, risk-averse optimization problems that involve multiple criteria, discrete decisions and recourse actions are not well studied. The goal of this project is to bridge this gap by developing novel models and effective methods that will enhance our knowledge base, and enable the solution of more realistic and general risk-averse multicriteria optimization problems. In particular, the problems that will be studied are prevalent in homeland security and humanitarian relief applications. By developing models and effective methods for such problems, this project will improve our ability to prepare for and respond to national emergencies.<br/><br/>This project involves three major thrusts that will advance the development of models and methods for risk-averse multicriteria optimization. First, in the realm of single-stage optimization, a novel model for risk-averse multiobjective optimization is proposed, where the relative importance of the multiple criteria is ambiguous. To this end, a new robust multivariate risk measure with desirable theoretical properties must be defined. In this project, the problem of optimizing such a risk measure will be formulated as a concave minimization problem for which effective solution methods will be developed. Second, a rigorous study of the fundamental non-convex polyhedral substructures arising in the cut generation problems for optimization under multivariate risk will be conducted. Third, two-stage optimization problems under multivariate risk will be formulated to allow recourse decisions. For these problems, decomposition algorithms that involve successive linear approximations of the second-stage problems will be devised."

One way they do this is by observing what happens when counter-rotating beams of protons collide. The characteristics of the debris produced in the collisions can reveal the basic physics of fundamental particles and the forces between them. Highly sophisticated particle detectors and analysis methods are required to measure these characteristics. NSF provides funding to US researchers to conduct research in experimental high energy physics using the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world?s premier laboratory for this research. In addition to directly supporting research activities, NSF will provide, via this award, funding to twenty-nine US universities to maintain the operation of US-supplied components of the CMS detector and its supporting software and computing systems, carry out technical planning and development that will enable future enhancements to CMS?s detection capabilities, and promote science education and outreach. The Large Hadron Collider is located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva Switzerland.<br/><br/>US participation in CMS will stimulate the development of a scientific and technically educated workforce, advancing the multidisciplinary application of technology, and the popularization and dissemination of science to the general public. The award will support activities that provide opportunities to develop and maintain complex detector apparatus, custom analog and digital electronics and software systems for data management, data processing and technical analysis. Technical professionals are required to perform many of these tasks, increasing the expertise of the US work force. The operation of existing detector components, design of upgrade components, and related research activities create opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration among university physics personnel, university personnel in engineering departments, and physics department technical personnel as  physicists, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and computer scientists work with post-docs and students. Similarly, physics personnel will work closely with computing professionals at their home institutions and at national laboratories to support the various software and computing activities.<br/>Technical part: This award supports the development and operation of the instrumentation and analysis tools that are essential to studying debris from proton-proton collisions. These tools are essential for answering basic, foundational questions, such as ?What is the origin of mass of the elementary particles?? The Higgs Boson discovery, a physical manifestation of the mechanism that generates elementary particle masses, led to the 2013 Physics Nobel Prize that was awarded to Peter Higgs and Francois Englert. Is that the end of the story, or are there other, as-of-yet undiscovered, contributions to this process?  Other fundamental questions, equally important, may have answers that depend, at least in part, on the physics observed through the continued operation and analysis of data obtained from the LHC. ?What is the dark matter that accounts for 25% of the mass of the universe? Can dark matter be produced and observed at the LHC? Can evidence of extra dimensions predicted in some models be found at LHC energies? Are there particles with exotic properties, unlike any forms of matter observed so far, whose existence is predicted by some theories that extend the standard model of elementary particles??

As a concrete example one can consider the trajectory of a ball on an ideal table. The table is frictionless and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.   A classical mathematical problem is to study the trajectories of a ball when the sides of the table form a polygon - not necessarily a rectangle.  There can be different types of trajectories.  Some trajectories can be periodic and some can be dense on the table.  This simple problem is notoriously difficult.  It is very difficult to solve the problem for a particular table, unless it is of a special shape; for example, a rectangle or an equilateral triangle.   This leads to the study of families of tables that have similarities.  You could for instance, study the family of tables with five sides.  Taking the family of tables as a new space it is possible to define a new flow on this space.  This point of view turns out to have important consequences.  For example, we may now be able to say what happens on ""most"" tables.

Second, by installing these code inspectors in real scientific code bases, the investigators study their behavior in uncertain environments. This phase includes two research activities: (i) prioritizing code segments based on quantitative impact scores and matching segments to inspector motifs; and (ii) finding the optimal code inspector implementations and patching the code with them so as to optimize the overall result variance.

They have novel materials properties and promising applications.  Here, a new concept of ink for 3D printing, termed ""active ink"", is introduced.  Even a small fraction of active self-propelled particles in a fluid results in a dramatic reduction of viscosity, enhancing ink transport through the nozzle and increasing printing speed.  This project will facilitate the design and manufacture of new materials, significantly shortening the path from prototype to product.  This research will also enable a highly multidisciplinary training and education of students and postdocs who will learn theoretical techniques in applied mathematics and computations, as well as experimental techniques employed in chemistry and nanofabrication.  Apart from the development of new 3D printing technology, the work will lead to novel mathematical models and efficient computational algorithms.<br/><br/>A drastic reduction of effective viscosity and increase of self-diffusivity of the active ink due to the presence of synthetic self-propelled particles will be studied.  The reduction of the effective viscosity will enhance ink transport through the nozzle.  The increase of the effective self-diffusivity will enable faster polymerization resulting in resolution enhancement and more accurate 3D feature design.  In addition, due to their fundamentally different response to applied shear flow, the use of active particles may lead to the design of composite materials with novel distributions of particles.  The functionalization of active particles also will allow tuning the properties of the hardened polymer.  New mathematical models will be developed and analyzed both numerically and analytically.  Their predictions will be experimentally verified.  The continuum partial differential equation model based on kinetic theory will be analyzed asymptotically and numerically.  A key challenge here is to find stationary flow solutions by employing methods from fixed-point and topological degree theory.  In simulations of particle-based models, the challenge is to accurately capture the dynamics of the reaction that occurs as the active rods move.  A difficulty in simulations of the continuum model is incorporating the molecular-scale reactions into a mesoscale approach.  By addressing these challenges, the utility and applicability of these computational methods will be significantly expanded, allowing them to be used for simulating a broad range of multi-component, dynamical systems."

Recently the PI has found a way to construct motives with exceptional Galois groups using automorphic forms and the geometric Langlands correspondence.  This idea will be systematically developed in the following years and will have applications to the classical inverse Galois problem.  The PI will also use moduli spaces of Hitchin type to study representations of rational Cherednik algebras, enumeration of Galois representations, and global analogs of Lusztig's character sheaves.<br/><br/>In mathematics, it is a general rule that the most interesting symmetries should arise geometrically.  For example, the ancient classification of Platonic solids is seen nowadays as an instance of finding all 'finite symmetries' in three-dimensional space.  With the revolution of algebraic geometry in the second half of the 20th century, we now have powerful geometric tools available to solve classical and new problems in number theory and group theory. The PI will use these geometric tools to attack problems in the Langlands program.  In the 70s, Langlands made a series of conjectures which links arithmetic invariants (e.g., solutions to Diophantine equations) to analytic invariants (e.g., modular forms).  The predictions that Langlands made, if proved, will be extremely powerful in solving classical problems (including the Fermat Problem which was solved in this way).  Through this project, the PI hopes to shed light on some problems in the Langlands program and to discover more symmetries that appear in geometry."

Most students do not have sufficient opportunities to learn the QR skills needed for personal and professional success, and this disadvantage is particularly acute among students from underrepresented minority populations. In response to this need, two Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), Hostos Community College and Lehman College will implement a professional development (PD) project, Numeracy Infusion for College Educators (NICE), for 24 faculty in those two institutions along with Bronx Community College faculty (also an HSI). The project will build on prior work in which faculty members learned how to infuse QR into courses ranging from biology, chemistry, and mathematics, to African and African-American studies, history, and political science.<br/><br/>Over the course of the project, faculty volunteers will participate either in an intensive 10-week summer program or in a 10-month program offered during the academic year. The NICE project will teach faculty how to (a) apply QR within the context of their subject areas, (b) articulate QR learning goals and objectives, (c) incorporate best practices for teaching QR, (d) adapt and implement strategies for infusing QR into course instruction, and (e) assess the effectiveness of QR initiatives. The same progressive teaching methods that have proven effective in undergraduate QR instruction will be used to teach faculty within the NICE program; specifically, faculty will engage in active and collaborative learning using real-world data. Toward establishing an adaptable model for faculty PD in QR that offers a comparison between an extended academic year experience and a more intense summer-only experience, the project team will focus on three key research questions: (1) How does the NICE program enhance the QR teaching abilities of faculty? (2) How does the NICE program impact faculty efforts to infuse QR into their course instruction?; and (3) How does faculty participation in NICE translate into real QR learning gains among CUNY students?"

To tackle this challenge, this research aims to bridge the gap between policy makers and regulators and system designers by making privacy laws and regulations understandable and actionable by software professionals. Specifically, this research designs and develops a deck of privacy ideation cards based on US privacy laws and regulations. The privacy ideation cards produced by this research can potentially transform how privacy-relevant aspects are handled in real-world software solutions built by industry and inform how students are taught these issues in undergraduate software curricula.<br/><br/>A critical contribution of this research is a deck of ideation cards to facilitate the design, development, and deployment of systems that take into account relevant US privacy laws and regulations at every step of the system building process. The cards are designed based on input from legal scholars and experts in the domain of US privacy laws. The design is geared toward promoting an understanding of privacy regulation by software professionals as well as students. This research involves applying the cards to the design of real-world solutions in industry as well as at a university (in a software project course). These applications enhance the knowledge of how privacy-related ideation techniques can be effectively employed in professional software development as well as software education. The findings facilitate the design and development of systems that comply with privacy laws and regulations and are sensitive to the privacy needs of their users, thus promoting and extending the Privacy by Design approach."

The underlying motivation for the Institute is to attract more students into graduate work in the Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, and facilitate their transition into research work at a time when demand for human resources with data analytic skills easily exceeds the supply.  The RUSIS@UNR program will prepare students to compete globally in a vibrant world where data-driven decisions are becoming more prominent in all human endeavors.  While the program has been successful in motivating and enticing students to pursue graduate careers in the statistical sciences, it also provides the necessary tools for students to join the workforce in a wide range of professional positions.  From academic jobs, to jobs in the pharmaceutical companies, private industry, government agencies and national laboratories, professional sports as data analysts, and climate scientists, the job outlook for statisticians and data scientists is excellent. <br/> <br/>The RUSIS@UNR objectives will be accomplished through the following mechanisms: (1) Mentoring and research supervision, of 15 selected underrepresented minority undergraduate students and students with no easy access to a career experience at their institution, through an intensive core course in probability and statistics. In addition, topics in stochastic processes, and statistical inference, with special emphasis on areas of current interest will be discussed; (2) Engaging the students in research projects from areas of current interest.  Statistical thinking is ubiquitous in every aspect of modern life. Data Mining, Big Data, Data Analytics, Knowledge Discovery are terms that have been coined in the past to denote essentially the same thing: activities related to the extraction of information from data to advance science, technology, and society.  Statistics provides the tools (from concepts and methods to algorithms to operational software) needed to extract valid and reliable information from large data sets of diverse origin, and provides the methodologies to validate the models and quantify the inherent uncertainty.  The students will engage in projects selected from (a) areas of genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, gene annotation, brain imaging, that rely to a very high degree on large and high-dimensional data sets, (b) environmental sciences, geophysics (including climate studies) astrophysics, cosmology, that regularly collect terabytes of high-dimensional data containing essential information about our World, and rely on knowledge extraction using tools inherent in statistical techniques, and (c) autonomous systems (e.g. autonomous cars) that make use of statistical techniques such as pattern recognition, statistical learning, and dimension reduction methodologies.   In the last few years, there have been several national initiatives that require new statistical tools and theories, as well as an increased production of modernly trained statisticians.  Prominent among these initiatives are: The brain initiative, the smart power grid initiative, big data and data analytics, climate change, and precision medicine; (3) Students will present their results at national meetings and they will be mentored in the preparation and presentation of their talks.  Short courses in LaTeX, and software used for research purposes (Mathematica, MatLab, R) will be taught; (4) Visits to scientific facilities (e.g., Desert Research Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) will be organized.  The progress of students for seven years (expected time for them to finish graduate school) after their participation will be monitored and annual evaluation of the program by the participating students and an external advisory committee will take place."

Anthropologists have long studied to the study of the role of religion in political life and have noted how leaders frequently appropriate rituals and symbolism to create a sense of legitimacy, political solidarity, and to constitute power. The Aztecs, for example employed ritual sacrifice as a means of supporting conquest and legitimizing their own rule. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, religion continued to be one of the varied strategies of domination used by colonizers, along with violence, coercion, and negotiation. Such processes are not unique to the past but may also be found in the modern world, particularly in situations of religious fundamentalism. How do leaders use religion to recruit new followers? What strategies work and which ones do not? If one can better understand these tactics, it will be possible to shed light on how these processes both shaped the past and play out today. Archaeology is uniquely suited to study the long-term influences of religion on political life as it is the only discipline that allows us to look at change over long periods of time. This research is also important because it will provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to gain training and experience in both archaeological excavation and laboratory analysis. The researchers will likewise work closely with community members to enhance knowledge of local history and archaeology and to promote science and learning among adults and youth.<br/><br/>Although it is known that religion played an important role in both Aztec and later Spanish domination, there is still little understanding of how and when elites appropriated and manipulated popular cosmologies, how provincial elites related to the religion of the capital, and how ordinary people responded to religious change. In order to better understand these processes, the investigators will conduct archaeological research at the pre-Hispanic regional center of Xaltocan, in the Basin of Mexico.  The case-study of Xaltocan is particularly important since researchers are able to examine change spanning its 1,100-year history from the site?s initial founding as a small community, its growth into an important political center, and its eventual conquest by the Aztec Empire, and finally, the Spanish Empire. The research team will excavate ritual sites dating to the pre-Hispanic through colonial periods, including a possible pre-Hispanic temple, using rigorous scientific methodologies including ground penetrating radar (GPR), large-scale horizontal excavation, chemical analysis of living surfaces, and the analysis of micro-remains. These interdisciplinary datasets will permit examining long-term change in ritual practice and they will provide a better understanding of the strategies of intermediate elites, such as those of conquered towns like Xaltocan. This project will contribute to the literature on intermediate elites in ways that should be of interest to scholars in Aztec studies, anthropology, and religious studies."

Such professions include hazardous cargo trucking, heavy machinery operation, security and defense, air traffic control, etc. Indeed, technology for acquiring rich biosensor data streams that capture brain function, e.g., electroencephalography, are becoming increasingly portable and noninvasive. These developments present an opportunity for implementing not only real-time monitoring, but also providing pre-emptive alerts (e.g., smart phone displays), which can be used to indicate degradation in physiological states. This research has direct applications in biomedical settings - for instance, epilepsy, is one of the most common neurological disorders afflicting over 50 million people worldwide, including 3 million people in the U.S. In about 25 percent of these patients, epileptic seizures are not controlled using available medications. Being able to detect (or predict) the onset of epileptic seizures would significantly enhance the patient's quality of life. In a proof-of-concept study, the novel analytical approaches by the research team detected the onset of epileptic seizures within 2.5 seconds. In contrast, existing approaches have a detection delay exceeding 7 seconds. From a broader perspective, the findings of this research can transform the status quo in real-time monitoring of neurophysiological function. The multidisciplinary research team will strive to provide state-of-the-art research and training opportunities for a diverse group of students that bridges the gap from engineering to the life and brain sciences. <br/><br/>The research team will develop a sensor data fusion approach based on graph theoretic topological mapping to combine data acquired from multiple biosensors for neurophysiological change point detection. Unlike existing approaches, which rely on complex signal pre-processing, the graph theoretic approach eschews these computationally demanding steps and is therefore more viable in a practical setting. The research team will exploit this framework using a data library of high-resolution neurophysiological recordings acquired from end users in realistic settings that induce shifts in global functional states (e.g., acute stress, cognitive exhaustion, and fatigue and so on). The research team will integrate automated decision-making approaches in the overall schema to synthesize the information and provide easily interpretable feedback to the end user (e.g., displays on a smart device). Furthermore, the PIs will customize biosensors to accommodate the patient's lifestyle."

This project will address this problem by creation of GraphPack, a comprehensive unified graph library with a coherent user interface and support for multiple state-of-the-art compute platforms. This work will have broad impacts in scientific and engineering application areas, larger social and economic areas depending on graph analytics, and in education. GraphPack will improve the ease of use and broaden the applicability of graph algorithms. Application areas include such diverse areas as knowledge discovery, genomics, proteomics, electronic design automation, forest management, Internet routing, power grid management, and many more.<br/><br/>GraphPack will be a reliable and comprehensive toolkit applicable across a wide variety of problems and architectures that will unleash the capabilities of the community by making the current state of the art readily available.

These abstractions will be incorporated as abstract concepts, and selected concrete efficient implementations will be provided. While genericity is an important goal, GraphPack will also provide a simplified user interface for graph algorithms for the situations where simplicity is more important than fully tuned performance. GraphPack will also provide a GraphBLAS interface based on the recent efforts to provide a standardized set of graph operations based on the concepts of linear algebra. By providing multiple interfaces with efficient parallel implementations, GraphPack will enable a wide variety of applications to take advantage of high-performance graph algorithms."

This new theoretical approach is able to directly quantify ecosystem sensitivity to changes in forcings, and how nonlinear feedback patterns can help predict possible ecosystem transition thresholds. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed work will create and widely disseminate a set of tools and data products that will allow ecologists across the USA to apply process network theory and information theoretic approaches to analyze ecosystem-scale environmental observatory data. This conceptual approach will be a valuable contribution to the ""data analysis toolbox"" being used by environmental observatories to explain ecological change and its impact on human societies for which these ecosystems represent vital life support. Graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar will be trained in the creation and application of these advanced quantitative methods in ecology and in the synthetic analysis of multi-scalar ecosystem data. The products of the theory-based models will form a critical analytical bridge between raw data collection and the environmental understanding necessary for informed resource management and policy-making in a future driven by historically unprecedented and nonlinear climate change impacts."

The mutant library will allow for the isolation and study of mutants in nearly all genes required for photosynthesis in green algae and plants. Furthermore, the library will also yield mutants in many highly conserved plant genes with putative roles in protein maturation and degradation, signaling, small molecule transport, redox regulation, lipid metabolism, and trace metal homeostasis. More broadly, half of the most widely conserved green plant genes remain completely uncharacterized. This resource will yield mutants in nearly all of these genes, and the study of these mutants will likely reveal entirely new pathways whose critical functions in plant biology are still not appreciated. This resource will also enable breakthroughs in other fundamental processes, including the green algal carbon concentrating mechanism, phototaxis, and the assembly and function of eukaryotic flagella.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Photosynthetic organisms provide energy, oxygen and organic building blocks for nearly all of the life on Earth. Plants are the origin of most of our food and many of our basic materials, and have important potential as a source of renewable energy and industrial chemicals. This mutant resource will lead to advances in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of plant biology, which will enable future increases in crop yields, the development of next-generation biofuels, and more informed policy decisions as human activities increasingly impact our environment. This resource will dramatically expand our knowledge of green algae, which will facilitate efforts to engineer these organisms for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins and renewable fuels, and for bioremediation.

The processors and architectures that enable this technology demand a large amount of energy, requiring sizable batteries. The ultimate objective of this CAREER research is to create programmable architectures which require no battery and can rely on energy harvesting techniques. To achieve this objective, we seek to reduce power consumption of the processing units by more than two orders of magnitude.  This power reduction is accomplished through novel, transformative methodologies to compose and configure programmable, ultra low power, granular decision-making architectures. New algorithms, tightly coupled with signal processing for power reduction in communication blocks are investigated. Research methods to activate and deactivate sensors with the granular decision making architecture attempts to further reduce the power consumption. The methodologies are validated and refined using two clinical case studies.<br/><br/>This project has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of health monitoring practice and medical research, empowering numerous applications that are not currently feasible. Growing demand for health care monitoring applications requires students, engineers and health care professionals to design, develop, deploy and operate wearable systems. This project provides a multidisciplinary platform to realize the educational objectives of developing wearable computers, involving high school students and teachers as well as undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach programs are offered through short courses and lectures to local undergraduate societies (SWE, Honors and IEEE), K-12 students, health-care professionals, and local industries."

It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.<br/><br/>Working together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability.

Intensification of crop agriculture is a global phenomenon that is rapidly shifting land use as populations and incomes increase. These agricultural changes have important implications for water use and quality, but land use changes are rarely associated with changes in water governance and management. This project will (1) identify how impacts from land conversion, cropland expansion and agricultural intensification interact to affect regional evapotranspiration, rainfall generation, river flooding, water quality and stream habitat and the thresholds of change that will endanger agricultural production, livelihoods and infrastructure, and (2) what mechanisms of governance and communication are best suited to facilitate effective and efficient water management. Farmers, ranchers, families, municipal officials and businesses will be engaged to assess what mechanisms can influence water security assessments and manage tradeoffs. This project will contribute toward an improved understanding of how shifts in land use impacts water use and governance and how engagement and management can impact freshwater sustainability in regions with rapidly changing land use."

Due to the rich social organization of bees, the overall performance and health of a bee colony depends both on a successful division of labor among the bees and on adequate reaction to the environment, which involves complex behavioral patterns and biological mechanisms. Much remains to be discovered on these matters as research is currently limited by our ability to effectively collect and analyze individual's behavior at large scale, out of the laboratory. The technology developed in this project will enable biologists to study the individual behavior of thousands of bees over extended periods of time. It builds on innovative algorithms and software to analyze big data collected from colonies in the field. Study of behavioral patterns at such scale will provide unique information to advance knowledge on biological processes such as circadian rhythms that influence bee behavior in addition to playing an important role in animals and humans. The models developed will help better understand factors involved in colony collapse disorder, thus guiding future research on threats to such an important pollinator. This work will be performed through the tight collaboration of a multi-disciplinary team of researchers to combine the latest advances in computer science and data science with expertise in biology.  It will provide the opportunity to train students from underrepresented minority on research at the intersection of these fields and to reach more than 600 undergraduate students, high school students, and the general public about how the Big Data approach can contribute to current scientific and ecological challenges.<br/><br/>The project will develop a platform for the high-throughput analysis of individual insect behaviors and gain new insights into the role of individual variations of behavior on bee colony performance. Joint video and sensor data acquisition will monitor marked individuals at multiple colonies over large continuous periods, generating the first datasets of bee activities of this kind on such a scale. Algorithms and software will be developed to take advantage of a High Performance Computing facility to perform the analysis of these massive datasets. Semi-supervised machine learning will leverage the large amount of data available to facilitate the creation of new detectors for parameters such as pollen carrying bees or fanning behavior, currently annotated manually. Predictive models and functional data analysis methods will be developed to find patterns in individual behavior based on multiple parameters and over large temporal scales. These advances are expected to help uncover mechanisms of individual variations previously unobservable. They will enable the first large scale biological study on the circadian rhythms of the bee based on the variations in behavior of individuals in multiple activities instead of reasoning on single activities or averages.

Because they usually possess elevated privileges and have skills, knowledge, resources, access and motives regarding internal systems and data, insiders can easily circumvent security countermeasures, steal valuable data, and cause damage. Perimeter and host-based countermeasures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software are ineffective in preventing and detecting insider threats.  Despite the availability of abundant anecdotal information regarding insider threats, research relying on field data to advance understanding of such threats is still lacking.  This proposal presents a theoretically driven approach to investigate the risk of insider threat within financial institutions. It will utilize large scale field data from two financial institutions to provide comparison and improve the generalizability of results.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will use criminology theories and extend them to the domain of insider threat.  It will use both objective log data from the enterprise single sign-on (eSSO) systems and subjective data through surveys and focus groups to understand perceptual characteristics of applications as well as perceptions of employees regarding attractiveness of targets. Thus, this research will be among the first that takes both the technical and human aspects into consideration in investigating victimization risk and attack proneness associated with information assets within financial institutions.  In essence, the proposed study will utilize multi methods and multi-source data to establish how information resources can be better protected from misuse and abuse of access privileges. The study will initiate a new perspective for analyzing existing behavioral log data to improve the practice of risk management, which may have a transformative impact in terms of mitigating risks from different user groups and informing interventions to deal with the insider threat problem. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: This multi-disciplinary collaborative project will deepen understanding of insider threat behavior in the context of financial institutions.  A PhD student will be funded at each university and the research will result in a few Masters' independent studies in this area as well. The findings of this proposal will be disseminated among the law enforcement task forces, as well as banking organizations. The channels to be employed include workshops with the local InfraGuard program in collaboration with the regional FBI office. The outcomes of the proposal will not only provide an applied understanding of insider threat, but also important implications for risk management applications.  It is important to note that the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board identified the banking and finance sector as one of the critical infrastructures to be secured.  This proposal will help in this regard by having an impact on public policy with respect to regulations for financial institutions. The potential reduction in financial crime as a result would have significant societal benefits."

The authors also consider the consequences for those collective efforts for educational inequality. While prior research largely views PTOs as inconsequential based on their small contributions to school finances, more than 90 percent of parents of elementary school children report attending a PTO meeting. The collective action that parents undertake via PTOs often contributes to the definition of school cultures and shapes the distribution of learning opportunities within schools. Since PTO participation rates, as well as access to the financial, organizational, and social capital resources that PTOs generate, vary substantially across racial/ethnic and socio-economic groups; PTOs may simultaneously benefit some students and play a significant role in the reproduction of inequality across and within schools. To make sense of parental collective actions and their consequences, the authors develop three theoretically-informed hypotheses about how PTOs operated in schools:  PTOs as generators of resources, PTOs as social capital, and PTOs as mechanisms for opportunity hoarding.<br/><br/>The analyses test these hypotheses by addressing the following research questions: How do parent-teacher organizations affect elementary school practices as well as student behavioral and academic outcomes? To what extent do parent-teacher organizations contribute to educational inequality both between and within schools? To do so, the authors construct an unprecedented data archive describing elementary school parent-teacher organizations. Working with the Urban Institute's National Center for Charitable Statistics' database of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filings for U.S. non-profit organizations, the authors have extract data describing parent-teacher organizations affiliated with U.S. public schools between 2005 and 2012 and link these records with (1) school-level data from the National Center of Education Statistics? nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and (2) student-level data from all North Carolina public elementary schools. This work, coupled with qualitative research designed to validate IRS measures of parents? collective action, will significantly contribute to the field of Sociology as well as educational practice by shedding light on how these organizations form and operate."

Until recently, such communication has been mostly handled by wireless technologies operating in narrow spectrum bands. However, such technologies fall short of addressing public safety requirements, such as deep situational awareness features that necessitate video streaming capabilities. This research proposes the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) along with cellular technologies within a novel and transformative framework that will serve as the pillar of next generation PSC systems. Reaping the benefits of the proposed architecture requires addressing several technical challenges including: 1) potentially damaged network infrastructure, as in the aftermath of an earthquake, causing severe connectivity problems; 2) dynamically varying interference between aerial and ground base stations as well as user equipment, hindering broadband throughput; 3) seamless connectivity problems, in the form of handover failures, exacerbated by dynamic interference and infrastructure mobility. <br/><br/>For addressing these challenges, the proposed research will lay down an interdisciplinary research agenda that combines broadband wireless networks, UAV communications, software defined radios, reinforcement learning, and stochastic geometry, into an integrated and synergistic framework. The project will introduce several innovations that involve self organizing interference and mobility management techniques to achieve ubiquitous broadband connectivity for PSC networks. A comprehensive hardware/software PSC testbed with powerful UAV and radio equipment will be developed to validate, evaluate, and improve the proposed solutions. The theoretical and experimental outcomes will break new ground in PSC systems by enabling real-time wireless multimedia and deep situational awareness capabilities in mission-critical PSC scenarios. Close industrial collaboration will reinforce the proposed testbed, prototyping, and educational efforts, and allow training of undergraduate/graduate students in industrial labs. Outreach activities to local high-schools will attract underrepresented minorities, particularly Hispanics, into STEM areas and the field of wireless networks."

Melting ice from the last retreat, from 19,000 to 9,000 years ago, raised sea levels by 8 meters or more, but the extents of previous retreats are less well known.  The main goal of this project is to understand how Antarctic ice retreats: fast or slow, stepped or steady, and which parts of the ice sheet are most prone to retreat. Antarctica loses ice by two main processes: melting of the underside of floating ice shelves and calving of icebergs. Icebergs themselves are ephemeral, but they carry mineral grains and rock fragments that have been scoured from Antarctic bedrock. As the icebergs drift and melt, this 'iceberg-rafted debris' falls to the sea-bed and is steadily buried in marine sediments to form a record of iceberg activity and ice sheet retreat. The investigators will read this record of iceberg-rafted debris to find when and where Antarctic ice destabilized in the past. This information can help to predict how Antarctic ice will behave in a warming climate. <br/><br/>The study area is the Weddell Sea embayment, in the Atlantic sector of Antarctica. Principal sources of icebergs are the nearby Antarctic Peninsula and Weddell Sea embayment, where ice streams drain about a quarter of Antarctic ice. The provenance of the iceberg-rafted debris (IRD), and the icebergs that carried it, will be found by matching the geochemical fingerprint (such as characteristic argon isotope ages) of individual mineral grains in the IRD to that of the corresponding source area. In more detail, the project will: <br/><br/>1. Define the geochemical fingerprints of the source areas of the glacially-eroded material using samples from each major ice stream entering the Weddell Sea.  Existing data indicates that the hinterland of the Weddell embayment is made up of geochemically distinguishable source areas, making it possible to apply geochemical provenance techniques to determine the origin of Antarctica icebergs. Few samples of onshore tills are available from this area, so this project includes fieldwork to collect till samples to characterize detritus supplied by the Recovery and Foundation ice streams. <br/><br/>2. Document the stratigraphic changes in provenance of iceberg-rafted debris (IRD) and glacially-eroded material in two deep water sediment cores in the NW Weddell Sea. Icebergs calved from ice streams in the embayment are carried by the Weddell Gyre and deposit IRD as they pass over the core sites. The provenance information identifies which groups of ice streams were actively eroding and exporting detritus to the ocean (via iceberg rafting and bottom currents), and the stratigraphy of the cores shows the relative sequence of ice stream activity through time. A further dimension is added by determining the time lag between fine sediment erosion and deposition, using a new method of uranium-series isotope measurements in fine grained material.  <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/><br/> The behavior of the Antarctic ice sheets and ice streams is a critical topic for climate change and future sea level rise. The goal of this proposal is to constrain ice sheet response to changing climate in the Weddell Sea during the three most recent glacial terminations, as analogues for potential future warming. The project will also examine possible contributions to Meltwater Pulse 1A, and test the relative stability of the ice streams draining East and West Antarctica. Much of the West Antarctic ice may have melted during the Eemian (130 to 114 Ka), so it may be an analogue for predicting future ice drawdown over the coming centuries. <br/><br/>Geochemical provenance fingerprinting of glacially eroded detritus provides a novel way to reconstruct the location and relative timing of glacial retreat during these terminations in the Weddell Sea embayment. The two major objectives of the project are to: <br/><br/>1. Define the provenance source areas by characterizing Ar, U-Pb, and Nd isotopic signatures, and heavy mineral and Fe-Ti oxide compositions of detrital minerals from each major ice stream entering the Weddell Sea, using onshore tills and existing sediment cores from the Ronne and Filchner Ice Shelves. Pilot data demonstrate that detritus originating from the east and west sides of the Weddell Sea embayment can be clearly distinguished, and published data indicates that the hinterland of the embayment is made up of geochemically distinguishable source areas. Few samples of onshore tills are available from this area, so this project includes fieldwork to collect till to characterize detritus supplied by the Recovery and Foundation ice streams. <br/><br/>2.

In addition, many herbivores are pests that eat agricultural plants or compete with livestock for food in rangelands.  Past research has focused on three factors that might control herbivore communities: 1) the total amount of plant material available for them to eat, 2) the number of different types of plants available for them to eat, and 3) how much nitrogen and phosphorus (two important nutrients known to be important to herbivore growth) is available in plant material. However, knowing these three things about a particular location has not proved to be enough information to allow scientists to accurately predict how many and what type of herbivores will be present. Recent research has suggested the possibility that other micronutrients such as calcium, potassium, and sodium may help explain how herbivore communities are structured. In the past, scientists thought that these other nutrients were common enough in all plants that they would not affect herbivores. This research will test the hypothesis that some of these micronutrients help to determine the identity and densities of herbivore communities. If this hypothesis is supported, it will suggest novel explanations for what controls herbivore abundance and species composition, which may be helpful for agricultural applications.<br/><br/>Soil micronutrients may benefit or harm herbivores directly (by affecting plant food quality) or indirectly (by altering plant community composition). Preliminary data from a coastal tallgrass prairie in Texas showed that foliar micronutrients were better predictors of herbivore community structure than were plant biomass, diversity or macronutrients, and that soil micronutrient concentration affected feeding of grasshoppers when host plant identity was held constant. This project will support a large, multi-factorial field experiment in a coastal tallgrass prairie located south of Houston that will rigorously test the importance of micronutrients in mediating herbivore abundance and diversity, and determine if the importance of micronutrients 1) depends on macronutrients and 2) varies among herbivore feeding modes and guilds. Complementary mesocosm and laboratory experiments will test potential mechanisms of micronutrient effects; that is, whether micronutrients affect herbivores directly or indirectly. This study will be the first to manipulate macro- and micronutrients in concert for understanding insect community structure, and will do so in the field at an unprecedented scale."

An example of such a problem is calculating the density of the Earth from measurements of the local gravitational field.  Only rarely can such inverse problems be solved analytically, and in general numerical approximations are required to find solutions. In this research project, the investigators aim to introduce a novel iterative algorithm for solving inverse problems, develop its theoretical and computational properties, and establish its performance in applications.  It is anticipated that the new algorithm will be adaptable to a range of problems currently under investigation in applied and numerical mathematics, for example in solving a sparse system of linear equations, currently of great interest in areas including tomography, archaeology, astrophysics, and other sciences.<br/><br/>This research project explores a novel iterative algorithm for the solution of a class inverse problems that includes Fredholm integral equations of the first kind, Laplace transform inversion, mixing distribution estimation in statistics, and solving sparse systems of linear equations. The investigators plan to (i) introduce a novel iterative algorithm for solving inverse problems of these types, and perhaps others, (ii) develop its theoretical and computational properties, and (iii) establish its performance in applications. A motivation for the research is the statistical problem of estimating a mixing density in a nonparametric mixture model. To date, there are no general algorithms that produce globally consistent estimators of the mixing density, in the sense of almost sure convergence with respect to a strong metric; only weak convergence results are available. An important feature of the algorithm under development is that, if it is initialized at a smooth density function, then the estimator is necessarily also a smooth density function. Other algorithms designed by numerical analysts for solving these inverse problems do not have this closure property. The form of the novel iterative algorithm, along with the fact that it yields smooth density estimators, suggests that this open problem can be solved; the investigators aim to establish a general global consistency result and demonstrate rates of convergence."

From a Bayesian perspective, it is imperative in these problems that the prior distribution be chosen to sit in a good position. Information about where is a good starting position can come from the data. There is a potential danger with this basic strategy, namely, that a double use of data might cause the model to track the data too closely, resulting on over fitting. To avoid this, the PIs introduce a regularization technique that suitably re-weights the likelihood, preventing the model from learning too quickly. This general ""double empirical Bayes"" strategy, where the prior is centered on the data and the likelihood is re-weighted, will be applied to several important and challenging high-dimensional problems, including estimation of sparse high-dimensional precision matrices, which is relevant to estimation of large complex networks. <br/><br/>In this project, the PIs will develop this new double empirical Bayes framework for inference on high-dimensional parameters with a relatively low ""complexity"" or ""effective dimension"". For example, in function estimation problems, posited smoothness on the function is a constraint on its complexity. The first step of the double empirical Bayes strategy is to use a prior, indexed by the complexity of the parameter, centered at a complexity-specific estimate of the parameter based on data. To prevent the posterior from tracking the data too closely, the second step is to re-weight the likelihood to be combined with the data-dependent prior. The result is a sort of posterior distribution on the parameter space, and the PIs will provide general conditions for this posterior to concentrate around the truth at optimal rates. An additional advantage of this new approach is that the complexity-specific priors, for suitable centering, can be taken of relatively simple form, which facilitates computation. The PIs will investigate the double empirical Bayes analysis of several important high-dimensional inference problems, including density and function estimation, variable selection problems in non-linear models, and estimation of sparse precision matrices. Software will be developed for each application."

In a typical lithographic process, a silicon wafer is coated with a radiation-sensitive polymer film (""resist"") and exposed to a pattern of light. Radiation triggers a reaction that generates the latent chemical image, and patterns are developed by selectively washing away the exposed (or un-exposed) material. Industrial applications require high-throughput processes, so the resists must be highly sensitive to radiation. This is achieved with a process termed ""chemical amplification"". Chemically-amplified (CA) resists have two principal components: (i) a lipophilic polymer with acid-labile protecting groups; and (ii) a low concentration of photoacid generator (PAG). Exposing the resist to radiation generates a strong acid-counterion catalyst, and heating at moderate temperature  promotes the acid-catalyzed decomposition of protecting groups along the polymer backbone. This deprotection reaction changes the polymer polarity for development in an aqueous base. CA systems are highly efficient because each photon absorbed by the resist generates approximately 0.3-2 acids (depending on the photon energy), and each catalyst cleaves hundreds of bonds so a low radiation dose is ""amplified"" through chemistry. However, the excellent sensitivity of CA resists comes at a price, because acid diffusion during reaction will limit the pattern resolution of CA resists. While CA resists have been studied for more than 40 years, there are no quantitative models that predict the spatial extent-of-reaction with nanoscale resolution. This poses an increasingly important roadblock for the semiconductor industry, as current research and development efforts are targeting sub-10 nm feature sizes.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The aim of this research program is to identify the fundamental physics and chemistry that produce anomalous catalyst transport and catalyst deactivation.  The PI hypothesizes that (i) anomalous catalyst transport is induced by dynamic heterogeneities in the glassy polymer films; and (ii) catalyst loss is a signature of acid-catalyzed side reactions. A series of experiments are planned that will reveal these effects. The knowledge acquired through this research will be developed into a predictive lithography tool that can accelerate materials development and process optimization. The spatial extent-of-reaction in CA resists cannot be directly measured with experiments, so experimental investigation needs to be coupled to models that predict composition at nanometer length scales. The intellectual merit of this research is the development of an efficient, quantitative, and spatially-resolved reaction-diffusion model for CA resists that is applicable in a wide range of processing conditions with parameters determined by experimental investigation. To achieve this goal, the study will employ a minimal set of variables to be determined through optimization while incorporating the underlying physics and chemistry of the glassy polymer matrix and acid catalyst. The framework developed through this research will offer a means to investigate processing conditions and formulations that have yet to be realized in laboratory experimentation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/><br/>The outcomes of this research program may immediately impact materials design and process development for next-generation lithography, as predictive models reduce or eliminate the need for iterative experimentation. After establishing the applicability of the anomalous transport model over a wide range of conditions, detailed descriptions of the method will be available to the general public via publications and presentations, furthering the development of lithography simulation that remains a bottleneck in industrial applications. The students engaged by this program will receive training in polymer physics and chemistry, computational methods, and designing experimental procedures. The PI has a record of engaging high school students and undergraduate students in laboratory research, and also participates in community outreach through NSF-funded K-12 camps at the University of Houston. Outcomes of this program will be incorporated into the PI's graduate course ""Chemical Processing for Microelectronics."""

The PI's goal in this project is to increase real-time access in the classroom to mathematical material for low vision students (who are visually impaired but not blind), which is currently mostly lacking as these students must primarily rely on assistive technology and human note takers to provide access to course materials after the class meeting.  The PI's approach is to bring together expertise in computer science, mathematics, and accessibility to provide a useful and usable solution to this problem for the iPad.  Called AccessMath, the prototype application will provide zoom-able camera views as well as a view of notes written at the whiteboard (captured by a Mimio), which may be altered through magnification and contrast adjustment features.   The system will support consulting and searching course content during lecture, including textbooks, handouts, notes written at the whiteboard, and audio in video (e.g., to find the word ""eigenvalue"" in recorded lectures for the course).  A novel note-taking facility will be employed, where notes are represented on note ""cards"" that can be attached to a specific location in the current view (e.g., at a spot in the whiteboard view), then manually moved, resized, rotated, stacked, and ""flicked"" out of view, providing a natural means for interacting informally with notes created during lecture.  Notes are created as blank cards, or as cards containing views of whiteboard data, video excerpts, or existing notes.  Notes are also used in constructing search queries.  Linear algebra (in particular matrices) is the pilot scope for the project, due to the many challenges in conveying a matrix, individual items within the matrix, following derivations, and the scale of the matrix needed when completing non-trivial problems.  AccessMath users will have a single iPad which connects to a server providing video feeds and recognition and retrieval services.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  AccessMath will assist low-vision students with mathematical instruction in and out of class, at the high school and university levels, by providing immediate access to lecture materials, including searches for mathematical content in whiteboard notes, handouts, textbooks, and lecture videos (through word spotting in audio).  The system will afford student ownership in note taking and customizing access, which will be significantly better than current solutions, and will reduce or eliminate the extent to which visually impaired students fall behind their sighted peers in the classroom setting.  The project will also advance the state-of-the-art in recognition and retrieval for mathematical notation, and will create a novel note-taking model using the metaphor of photos on a tabletop, which should be applicable to domains other than mathematics."

If successful, higher adoption of electrified vehicles is foreseeable in the near future to revolutionize the future transportation systems so that environmental challenges can be addressed for conserving energy and cutting back on carbon emissions and pollution. This research will also have significant impact on other applications such as aircraft electric systems, military portable devices, and aerospace battery applications, where lithium ion batteries are used for energy storage. These impacts will result in economic and social benefit and help the U.S. stay competitive globally. The theory and methodology will be integrated into education through modifications in related courses in order to engage graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project studies the uncertainty management and proactive maintenance of lithium ion batteries in electrified vehicles. The scope of the proposed work is to: i) increase accuracy of a baseline battery model; ii) develop an intelligent uncertainty management system; and iii) facilitate proactive maintenance decisions for lithium ion batteries. The investigators will address four issues including: i) characterization of battery model uncertainty under various battery operating conditions; ii) quantification of various uncertainties and their coupling effects in the battery system; iii) prediction of battery remaining useful life (RUL) under various battery operating conditions; and iv) validation of the proposed approaches on an electrified vehicle. Traditionally, researchers employ electrochemical models to improve battery model accuracy. However, a full order electrochemical model is not feasible for the battery management system (BMS) in electrified vehicles, and a significant level of model simplification must be established to meet the computational efficiency requirement which will cause unwanted model error. The first contribution of the research project will be to study an effective model uncertainty characterization approach to improve model prediction accuracy of a low-fidelity model (i.e., an equivalent circuit model) so that its accuracy is comparable to that of a high fidelity model (i.e., an electrochemical model) but with much higher computational efficiency. The second contribution of the project will be to develop an intelligent uncertainty management system for more effective battery performance estimation so that battery safety can be improved and lifetime risk minimized. Finally, the challenge of battery proactive maintenance stems from the complexity of battery devices. Even the best models cannot predict the complex degradation and failure mechanisms. As a result, accurate prediction of the battery RUL based on the underlying degradation theory is almost impossible. The third contribution of the research will be to study proactive maintenance decisions for batteries through accurate RUL prediction using innovative data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) technologies."

At the core of decision-making in such large and dynamic teams is team cognition, which in emergency response can be viewed as the responders' ability to form a ""common operating picture."" The goal of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to examine the relationship of cognition to individual and team performance in IMTs. While it is difficult to study actual IMTs at work, high-fidelity simulation facilities place responders in exercises that replicate real-world emergency events. This research leverages one such facility, the Emergency Operations Training Center (EOTC) operated by the Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service (TEEX), a world leader in emergency responder training, to study IMTs without the need to collect data during actual incidents (which would be both impractical and undesirable given the urgency of real events). Based on observations and recordings, the researchers will conduct a qualitative analysis of team communication and build social networks representing interactions among team members, which collectively form cognition in the team, according to recent findings. The researchers will break the team's work into its constituent elements and examine how each element makes use of key technologies. Because the work involves performance-oriented interventions, it will lead to improved responder training and thus will contribute to reduced loss of life and property during catastrophic events. The EOTC will be able to use research findings to guide redesign of software and training tools. As leaders in emergency management, EOTC instructors and staff are in regular communication with policymakers, enabling them to translate research outcomes into actionable information to improve the U.S. National Preparedness Guidelines, the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and state and local equivalents.<br/><br/>This research seeks to characterize the influence of interactions among humans, teams, and technologies on individual and team performance in high-pressure, time-constrained environments such as emergency response. In these situations, the IMT supports first responders from a centralized incident command post (ICP). The IMT solves complex safety-critical problems under high time pressure and ubiquitous information flow, so the team's ability to receive, process, and share information is essential to successful outcomes. Building on the view that team cognition is inseparable into individual cognition, the research focuses on the team as a singular entity, termed the ""aggregate team artifact."" Unlike traditional human-machine interaction (HMI) studies, this research examines two new complementary concepts: human-team interaction (HTI) and team-machine interaction (TMI). While HTI focuses on individuals' interactions with the aggregate team artifact, TMI applies HMI methods to the team entity's interactions with tools and technologies. The researchers will conduct a focused study to explore and validate HTI and TMI. During exercises involving actual emergency responders in high-fidelity ICP simulations, the work of the Planning subteam will be recorded and transcribed. Beginning with grounded theory analysis of transcripts, the researchers will categorize HTI and TMI content, build team communication networks to devise metrics of HTI, adapt task analysis techniques to assess TMI, and relate metrics of HTI and TMI to individual and team performance. This work will make fundamental contributions to human factors (HTI and TMI to complement HMI), social and organizational psychology (team cognition in real-world high-pressure settings), and systems engineering (characterization of teams as complex systems). By providing a proof-of-concept for HTI and TMI, this exploratory study will serve as an initial step toward the creation of an integrated predictive model for emergency response."

Using mathematical approaches coupled with laboratory experiments, this study will illustrate the basic principles of cellular aging and shed new light on how dietary restriction extends lifespan. Using a novel mathematical model that demonstrates how aging in yeast cells emerges and what genes and their interactions are involved, the close-connection between cellular aging and the robustness of the gene interactions involved will be examined.  Given the lack of adequate methods to evaluate changes in genes and their interactions involved in cellular aging, this novel mathematical approach for data analysis could transform what we know about how cells age.  Coupled to this research, the educational component of the project will provide cross-disciplinary training to minority students and cultivate their interests in quantitative biology through integrating research with teaching, a student Chapter for the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, tutorial workshops, and broad dissemination of educational materials.  Additionally, a new Systems Biology course will contribute to a new Bioinformatics and Systems Biology minor at Spelman College.

In summary, this project will provide training to minority undergraduates in mathematics, computing, and systems biology at a historically black college for women.<br/><br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project will focus on aging from the perspective of gene networks through an integrated research and teaching approach.  Cellular aging will be addressed using the budding yeast, a single-cell organism as a model system. The current knowledge on cellular aging lacks coherence, and a major logical gap exists between molecular pathways of aging and population characteristics of aging.  Hundreds of yeast genes are known to influence lifespan, but paradoxically, not a single gene can be claimed as a direct cause of aging. Different and even opposite pathways have been observed when experiments are performed in different ways. Despite the complexity of aging, the lifespan of many species can be extended by dietary restriction. This seemingly complicated picture and the evolutionarily conserved lifespan extension effect of dietary restriction will be addressed by the core idea of the study, that cellular aging is an emergent property of stochastic gene networks.  A probabilistic gene network model for cellular aging will be used to illustrate the conserved lifespan extension mechanism of dietary restriction in the model organism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and study how the organization and dynamics of the yeast gene networks will influence the aging process. The first objective is to test a hypothesis that dietary restriction extends lifespan by improving reliability of gene interaction through analyzing lifespan data of hundreds of yeast mutants.   The second objective is to further develop the theoretical foundation of the network model for cellular aging."

Mathematically the concept of curvature plays the central role. Partial differential equations (PDEs) arise naturally from many fundamental questions in Differential Geometry, notably in understanding a geometric space in terms of its curvature or finding an optimal geometric structure on a given space. The PI will focus on two important examples: minimal submanifolds and geometric flows. Minimal submanifolds are subspaces that locally minimize area (or volume). They have been studied since the work of Euler and Lagrange, yielding many applications to geometry and other related fields such as low-dimensional topology and general relativity. Moreover, they are important models for many interesting non-linear phenomena in nature and a variety of ideas developed in their study have turned out to be key in the calculus of variations, geometric PDEs, and mathematical physics. A geometric flow, on the other hand, is a process of deforming a given geometry through a parabolic system of PDEs coming from curvature. A prominent example is the flow by the Ricci curvature, or Ricci flow, which has had seminal consequences to the geometrization of three-dimensional spaces by the work of Hamilton and Perelman. <br/><br/>One of the tenets of this research project is that the existence of minimal submanifolds of certain topological and Morse index type can impose restrictions on the curvature of the ambient manifold, and vice-versa. The PI will investigate several questions relating the Morse index and the topology of minimal submanifolds in presence of positive curvature. Another aspect is the singularity formation phenomena in geometric flows, with a focus on the profiles of singularities and their rigidity and stability properties."

The CLT's main conclusion is that aggregated data follows the so-called Gaussian law, also known as the normal or ""bell"" curve. But scientists in many fields from seismology to computer science to quantitative finance are finding that their data series have long-range correlations, which means that the CLT may or may not be a valid way of looking at how such data aggregates. The PI's work on correlated data sequences, and related questions, would show that the Gaussian-law behavior afforded by the CLT persists up to very long correlation lengths, with some quantitative differences with the standard CLT, such as an increase in how spread out averages tend to get. For instance, one of the PI's theoretical conjectures is that if correlation is long enough, it would take too much data in practice to be able to observe a CLT-type aggregation. The PI will study the effect of even longer-range correlations, showing that instead of bell-curve behavior, data could involve much higher levels of uncertainty (a.k.a. heavy tails), with an extremely slow rate of aggregation. This could be of some significance when applied to financial risk in the housing market: tools could be developed for sellers of institutional mortgage insurance products for highly correlated mortgages; they would help avoid errors in risk calculations, such as those made by the American International Group (AIG) in the years preceding the world financial crisis of 2008, which resulted in a taxpayer-funded bailout upwards of $ 180 billion. The PI also plans to study the implications of long-range correlations in so-called spin models which are useful in the physics of random media, where, unlike the example of mortgage-based financial derivatives, long-range correlations and heavy tails could have little or no influence on the average large-scale behavior. The PI's Ph.D. students will take part in both theoretical and applied aspects of the research, working with the PI to prove theorems and test their results in practice using numerics. Involving students in fundamental research with real-world applications will broadly disseminate scientific understanding. The PI systematically encourages students from underrepresented groups to join the research program.<br/><br/>   The PI proposes a three-year research program in stochastic analysis, with two groups of topics. First, the complexity of asymptotic laws for variations of Gaussian processes with long-range correlations will be evidenced by searching for conditions implying normal, non-normal, and conditionally normal limits in general situations, including sharp convergence rates. Second, the PI will analyze densities, tails, and convex functionals, spin systems, and hitting probabilities, for general Malliavin-differentiable non-Gaussian processes and fields. A main set of tools is the new use of the Malliavin calculus for quantitative estimates of various distances between laws of random variables on Wiener space. This includes the PI's formula for the density of general random variables on Wiener space, proved with I. Nourdin in 2009. Another tool is the PI's comparison of convex functionals for random vectors and fields on Wiener space, proved in 2013 with I. Nourdin and G. Peccati. Yet another is the first sharp estimates of distances to the normal law on Wiener space, proved in 2012 and 2013 by Bierme, Bonami, Nourdin, and Peccati. The PI will forego power-scale model assumptions such as self-similarity and/or stationarity whenever possible, using instead assumptions which are intrinsic to general covariance structures. One of the consequence of the work will be to show that well-known behaviors in so-called critical cases for power variations can be artefacts of the chosen model classes. Another will be to find out the extend of the so-called Sherrington-Kirkpatrick universality class for spin systems in random media, and to determine behaviors when heavy tails and long-range correlations cause spin systems to exit this class. A third consequence should be to understand the critical cases for hitting probabilities of fractional Brownian motion."

Currently, many wastewater treatment plants are discharging treated wastewater containing significant amounts of nutrients, such as nitrogen, ammonium, and phosphate ions, directly into the water system, posing significant threats to the environment.  Large-scale algae production represents one of the most promising and attractive solutions for simultaneous wastewater treatment and biofuel production. The critical bottleneck is low algae productivity and high biofuel production cost.<br/><br/>The previous work of this research team has successfully developed an algae membrane bioreactor (A-MBR) technology for high-density algae production which doubles the productivity in an indoor bench-scale environment. The goal of this project is to explore advanced cyber-physical sensing, modeling, control, and optimization methods and co-design of the A-MBR system to bring the new algae production technology into the field. The specific goal is to increase the algal biomass productivity in current practice by three times in the field environment while minimizing land, capital, and operating costs. Specifically, the project will (1) adapt the A-MBR design to address unique new challenges for algae cultivation in field environments, (2) develop a multi-modality sensor network for real-time in-situ monitoring of key environmental variables for algae growth, (3) develop data-driven knowledge-based kinetic models for algae growth and automated methods for model calibration and verification using the real-time sensor network data, and (4) deploy the proposed CPS system and technologies in the field for performance evaluations and demonstrate its potentials.<br/><br/>This project will demonstrate a new pathway toward green and sustainable algae cultivation and biofuel production using wastewater, addressing two important challenging issues faced by our nation and the world: wastewater treatment and renewable energy. It will provide unique and exciting opportunities for mentoring graduate students with interdisciplinary training opportunities, involving K-12 students, women and minority students. With web-based access and control, this project will convert the bench-scale and pilot scale algae cultivation systems into an exciting interactive online learning platform to educate undergraduate and high-school students about cyber-physical system design, process control, and renewable biofuel production."

The focus of this project is on the coordination of these elements via ubiquitous sensing, communications, computation, and control, with an emphasis on the electric grid. The project integrates ideas from economics and behavioral science into frameworks grounded in control theory and power systems. Our central construct is that of a ?resource cluster,? a collection of distributed resources (ex: solar PV, storage, deferrable loads) that can be coordinated to efficiently and reliably offer services (ex: power delivery) in the face of uncertainty (ex: PV output, consumer behavior). Three topic areas form the core of the project: (a) the theoretical foundations for the ?cluster manager? concept and complementary tools to characterize the capabilities of a resource cluster; (b) centralized resource coordination strategies that span multiple time scales via innovations in stochastic optimal control theory; and (c) decentralized coordination strategies based on cluster manager incentives and built upon foundations of non-cooperative dynamic game theory.<br/><br/>These innovations will improve the operation of infrastructure systems via a cyber-physical-social approach to the problem of resource allocation in complex infrastructures. By transforming the role of humans from passive resource recipients to active participants in the electric power system, the project will facilitate energy security for the nation, and climate change mitigation. The project will also engage K-12 students through lab-visits and lectures; address the undergraduate demand for power systems training through curricular innovations at the intersection of cyber-systems engineering and physical power systems; and equip graduate students with the multi-disciplinary training in power systems, communications, control, optimization and economics to become leaders in innovation."

Unlike<br/>single genome sequencing, assembly of a metagenome is intractable and<br/>is in large part, an unsolved mystery.  Moreover, the advent of high<br/>throughput sequencing is fueling rapid generation of enormous<br/>metagenomic datasets. There is no available sequenced genome for a<br/>majority of the species. There is a need to determine the number of species in<br/>a metagenomic dataset as well as the abundance of each of these<br/>species.  The key steps (Assembly and Clustering) in the metagenomics<br/>analysis algorithms are compute-intensive, while the sheer amount of<br/>data the algorithms operate on is staggering.  The most promising way<br/>to tackle the computational challenges is to build special purpose<br/>hardware, dedicated solely to suitable algorithms.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop a range of flexible,<br/>affordable, parallel, fast hardware-accelerated bioinformatics<br/>solutions, using GPGPU, FPGA, and ASIC, for metagenomic analytics to provide an alternative to<br/>expensive computer clusters. Specifically,  hardware solutions for<br/>metagenomic clustering and assembly will be developed. Several<br/>acceleration methodologies, including parallel software mapping and<br/>special hardware design, are proposed to explore the parallelism<br/>inside the applications and to improve the data access bandwidth in<br/>the hardware running bioinformatics applications. The ideas proposed<br/>in this work will be evaluated in a multi-pronged manner using a<br/>combination of simulation, emulation and prototyping efforts. Further,<br/>the PIs will use a combination of commercial tools, collaborator<br/>resources and  existing internal tools. The research will be <br/>conducted in collaboration with  industrial partners. Through close<br/>collaboration with several industry partners,  direct transfer of many<br/>ideas to industry is enabled. The outcome of this research will,<br/>therefore, have a direct impact on future bioinformatics application<br/>solutions. This project will involve graduate and undergraduate<br/>students in all aspects of the research. The PIs will actively<br/>integrate the research results from this project into the graduate and<br/>undergraduate curricula, and develop new interdisciplinary courses on<br/>bioinformatics and computer architecture to train the next generation<br/>work-force. Finally, the tools and techniques developed in this<br/>research will be made available through   web-sites for use by other<br/>educators, researchers, and industry practitioners."

This property is a consequence of a particular interaction between electrons, which causes the electrons to organize themselves into a collective state that renders them immune to scattering. In nanoscale samples, the nature of this collective state is fragile and can be manipulated by controlling the physical properties of the samples and their environment. Using custom developed fabrication and measurement techniques with unprecedented capabilities, this project aims to design, manipulate and investigate collective quantum states of electrons in superconducting nanowires.  While serving to train students on cutting edge nanofabrication and low-temperature measurement techniques, the research is focused on creating a model system for a fundamental study of collective quantum states of electrons that will bring about the possibilities of applications in novel logic, sensing and quantum computing technologies.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The project aims to tailor and tune the texture of the superconducting order parameter by controlling the texture, the underlying potentials and the boundary conditions. The research team has developed a dynamic stencil deposition and controlled etching techniques, which are used to achieve precise control over the size and physical texture of the nanowires, while graphene and topological insulator materials provide a tunable electrostatic environment and a spin texture, respectively. The tunability of this model system provides exciting opportunities to address unanswered questions, but also to create new quantum states of matter that have not been studied or even considered before, possibly bringing about a paradigm shift in the study of quantum phase transitions. The main goal is to create and control new quantum states, contribute to fundamental understanding of quantum matter, and harness the quantum degrees of freedom for a host of possible applications."
