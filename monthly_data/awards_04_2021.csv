Such photo-electrocatalytic reactions are of relevance to many important energy-storage and industry processes. Dr. Qiu?s laboratory will utilize gold nanoparticle (Au NP) electrodes to harvest solar energy to influence the subsequent electrocatalysis. Dr. Qiu will probe changes at the electrocatalyst surface structure that occur during these reactions. This research has broader impact both scientifically and societally. Scientifically, it is expected to advance the understanding of plasmon-mediated electrocatalysis with the long-term goal to develop optical materials and technologies that are expected to drive forward the progress for clean energy production. Societally, this project will provide valuable instruction and inspiration for the next generation of scientists to pursue renewable energy research. The project will provide students, including those from underrepresented groups, with technical skills to enter the workforce or graduate school with the competencies that are required to address the challenges associated with renewable energy production. Dr. Qiu and her students will also develop short videos on electrochemistry topics in Spanish to help disseminate research in this area to a broader audience.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Jingjing Qiu of San Francisco State University will work to develop a fundamental understanding of the interface between plasmonic Au NP electrodes and electrocatalysts in the plasmon-mediated oxygen-evolving reaction (OER) with the long-term goal  of developing new optical methods to precisely tune the activity of electrocatalysts. (Photo)electrochemical characterization, in operando electrochemical surface enhanced Raman scattering (EC-SERS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) simulations will be applied to decouple the multi-effects of surface plasmons in enhancing the activity of electrocatalysts using the OER as a representative model reaction. The project involves the following specific objectives: (i) to determine the impact of plasmon excitation of Au NP electrodes interfaced with double layer hydroxide electrocatalysts on the OER, (ii) to decouple the contributions of the photothermal and electronic effects (?hot? holes) of Au NP electrodes on electrocatalysts in the OER, (iii) to measure the dynamic surface morphology of the electrocatalysts at the Au NP electrode interface and their surface chemical information, and (iv) to compute the electronic structures of the transition metal hydroxide electrocatalysts at the Au metal surfaces. This work has the potential to shed light on the mechanisms of plasmon excitation in the OER process and to provide new insights for other types of electrocatalytic oxidation reactions. A better understanding of the mechanistic basis for plasmonic effects would provide an important foundation for the development of new technologies increase the efficiency of the OER process, a key step in the all-important water-splitting reaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Heterogeneous catalysts accelerate the conversion of chemical species to valuable products, and they underpin a host of technologically important chemical processes, ranging from production of plastics to generation of electricity in fuel cells.  These catalysts are often composed of metal nanoparticles, the surfaces of which break and form chemical bonds in molecules to produce valuable products.  Fundamental models of how these molecular transformations occur have been developed for many chemical reactions and have greatly enhanced both the understanding of these transformations and the design of new catalytic materials.  However, these models often make significant approximations in their descriptions of the relevant molecular processes, including the assumption that reacting molecules and products are randomly distributed across the catalyst surfaces and do not interact with one another.  The development of improved theoretical descriptions that correct these approximations and explicitly describe how the reactions change when molecules interact strongly with one another, is, in turn, the central focus of this project.  The improved models will lead to more accurate descriptions of heterogeneous catalytic processes and may ultimately facilitate the design of improved catalysts. For broader impacts, the new capability and software will be made available to the catalysis community. Outreach and education efforts will focus on high school students at a very early stage in their academic path, to encourage the pursuit of STEM studies. PI will make a focused effort to engage students from diverse and under-represented groups. This activity will be a continuation of a successful effort by the PI, whereby the students are paired with the PI and graduate students to pursue tailored research projects.<br/><br/>Mean field theories of surface kinetics permit crucial information about heterogeneous catalytic processes, including the overall reaction rates, effective activation barriers, and reaction orders, to be predicted from a combined knowledge of the elementary reaction steps occurring on a catalyst surface and the rate constants of these elementary steps. In spite of the power of these theories, however, the mean field approximation begins to break down under conditions of strong interactions between surface adsorbates, and there is a need to develop surface kinetic modeling techniques that directly incorporate non-mean field effects while, at the same time, preserving the powerful physical and mechanistic insights that emerge naturally from deterministic mean field descriptions.  In this work, analytical or semi-analytical corrections to mean field expressions for equilibrium constants and rate constants of elementary reactions will be developed on square planar and hexagonal catalyst surfaces.  These expressions, which will be based on the Bethe-Peierls approximation to the Cluster Variation Method, will be used to identify mathematical and conceptual principles that describe when non-mean field effects will significantly impact surface catalysis.  The resulting formalisms, which will deterministically treat non-mean field effects while preserving the powerful mechanistic insights that can be obtained from mean field microkinetic analyses, will be benchmarked on two classic surface reaction chemistries, the direct and H2-assisted decomposition of NO and the synthesis or decomposition of ammonia from N2 and H2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Grotjahn and Andrew L. Cooksy of San Diego State University are performing research aimed at determining the best catalysts for new reactions that can be used to make organic compounds of interest for a variety of applications, including pharmaceuticals, materials, and biology. To accomplish this, many catalysts that contain a metal and a larger non-metal portion (ligand) will be made and tested, to determine what combinations of metals and ligands will yield the best performing catalysts. In addition, fundamental studies of how the catalysts operate on the molecular level will be performed. This grant will support the training of several young investigators in the field of catalysis. Because catalysis accounts for a third of global GDP and a majority of chemical products and chemical processes, the discovery of new or improved catalysts for organic reactions and new mechanisms has great practical importance, contributing to economic development and recovery. As in the previous grant period, practical catalysts will be developed and improved. Also, to broaden public understanding of catalysis, the PIs and the graduate students will introduce the concept into an existing and highly successful high school outreach program.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Douglas B. Grotjahn and Andrew L. Cooksy of San Diego State University will employ design principles of Nature?s enzymes, particularly hydrogen bonding and proton transfer, to accelerate (often by more than 1000-fold) organometallic catalysis and reactions by new mechanisms. Ligands containing proton-donating or hydrogen-bonding groups will be synthesized and combined with a variety of metal precursors to form their metal derivatives for catalysis. Interactions of these pendant groups with nonpolar and polar reactants, intermediates, or transition states are expected to create faster catalysts. The focus will be mostly on waste-free addition or isomerization reactions, with several goals: (1) integrate the use of computer-based molecular predictions before and after catalyst discovery; (2) build and apply a toolbox of alkene isomerization catalysts; (3) use ligands to enable X-H activation; and (4) develop catalysts for addition reactions. The project will include significant one-on-one training in modern techniques of organic and organometallic chemistry, including NMR spectroscopy, catalysis screening, and computation. The proposed research will add new mechanistic insight to our picture of bifunctional catalysis, using complementary experimental and computational studies to allow the design of better catalysts and chemical processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Soft robots are typically designed and controlled through a painstaking trial-and-error process involving several prototypes. This project seeks to automate this design and control process using a real-time physics-engine. The simulation addresses several key challenges in simulation of robots: (1) large structural deformation, (2) nontrivial coupling with hydrodynamic forces, and (3) preponderance of contact and collision. Model reduction is necessary to cast a complex robot into the simulation framework. Machine learning (ML) provides an exceptional set of tools to reduce complex structures into a model without compromising accuracy. The fast simulation tool, based on physics and ML, will be used to build a control framework for a bacteria-inspired soft robot.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is formulation of fast and efficient physics-based simulation, assisted by machine learning, for autonomous control of soft robots. Using this framework, a macroscale bacteria-inspired robot will be designed and controlled. This robot will use buckling in flagellum (thin flexible tail) to control its swimming direction. This is expected to be the simplest autonomous soft robot with a single scalar control input. Two key challenges to be tackled in the project are: (1) computational efficiency so that the simulation can be used for optimization, and (2) physical accuracy and robustness of the models so that model-based control can be employed on the real robotic systems. Towards this goal, machine learning-assisted modeling of complex systems in a discrete differential geometry-based simulation framework is planned. Neural network-based models for the structure of the robot and the hydrodynamics will be developed. These models are expected to be as fast as simplified heuristic models and as accurate as physics-based fine-grained models. This simulation tool will be used to develop a model-based control framework for the bacteria-inspired robot for untethered autonomous operation. This robot can help us gain insight into bacterial locomotion, e.g., role of instability in bacterial propulsion. From a robotics perspective, the robot has only one control input with minuscule number of moving parts. The design of the robot makes it amenable for miniaturization to sub-millimeter scale with potential biomedical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the minute scale where such phenomena occur, however, the information carriers, such as atoms, are fragile and highly susceptible to noise. In order to build scalable and reliable quantum systems, one needs to mitigate noise through error-correction techniques. A quantum error correcting code (QECC) encodes data in a larger mathematical space so that the redundancy can be use to detect and correct errors. For quantum computation, one needs to regularly do such error correction, which tries to preserve data as it is, while also performing active computation to process the data, which keeps altering it. In order to be fault-tolerant, such a quantum computer needs to find ways of carefully balancing computation and decoding (error correction) while keeping resource requirements at a minimum. This is a very challenging task, and this project develops methods to study modern QECCs that are optimized for the dynamics between encoded computation and decoding using techniques from classical error-correction theory. The team will also nurture young talent in these areas and inspire underrepresented groups to join the growing quantum workforce.<br/><br/>The celebrated threshold theorem of QEC established that quantum information can be protected indefinitely as long as each hardware component meets a fidelity threshold that is a function of the specific QECC. This project will provide a concrete understanding of desirable code structure, motivated by practical constraints, and hence address both thresholds and computational overhead as a function of this structure. Specifically, the intellectual contributions of the proposed research plan can be summarized as follows: (1) Recent results of investigators have produced systematic methods to synthesize logical operations on stabilizer codes. The team of researchers will begin by applying such methods to quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes in order to understand their utility for logical computation. (2) The team will explore strategies such as concatenation and lifting algebraic protographs to combine the best aspects of QLDPC codes and algebraic codes such as quantum Reed-Muller codes. (3) For QEC, it has been observed that iterative decoders with symmetric message updates fail on QLDPC codes due to cycles and ""quantum"" trapping sets related to error degeneracy. The team will leverage their classical expertise to develop single-shot algorithms based on message-passing with noisy syndromes, understand the effect of non-linear message updates, and analyze error floors. (4) The investigators will also determine how the desirable graph structure for such methods interplay with realizing logical operations on these hybrid QECCs. Finally, the team will combine these insights with other promising approaches such as measurement-based quantum computation, which will make the results apply across a wide array of technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern coral reef science encompasses broad scientific fields, including biology, geology, chemistry, and physics, necessitating a cross-disciplinary effort to understand these complex ecosystems and how they will respond to local and global anthropogenic change. Our goal is to inspire the next generation of scientists to bridge diverse scientific disciplines to gain a transdisciplinary understanding of coral reef ecosystems. To reach this goal, we will offer a series of three Advanced Science Institutes (ASI) in Australia that will foster the collaborative environment necessary to address the existing and emergent needs of the coral reef scientific and conservation communities. We will model these graduate-level courses after approaches developed for Earth Systems science, which combine traditional disciplines to build a holistic understanding of Earth as a complex and adaptive system. By incorporating a team of domestic and international experts from various disciplines in coral reef science, these ASIs will help to address the current shortage in transdisciplinary researchers equipped to deal with the complex problems facing coral reefs and other marine ecosystems. Training through these ASIs will address specific and measurable societal needs by improving the quality of STEM education for U.S.-based, marine science graduate students, ultimately enhancing the science and technology available to inform public environmental policy. A key priority will be to recruit U.S.-based graduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups (women, persons with disabilities, and minorities) to promote diversity and equity in STEM research fields. By meeting these goals, we will increase the competitiveness of American STEM education programs in the international market, foster international partnerships in research and education between the U.S. and Australia, and enhance the American workforce in STEM industry, agency, and academia.<br/><br/>Given the unprecedented pressure from climate change and other anthropogenic stressors that coral reefs and the communities that depend on them face, proactive management and novel techniques at the margins of terrestrial and marine ecosystems are urgently needed to counteract the degradation of these ecosystems. As a response to the shortage of broadly trained, transdisciplinary coral reef scientists, these ASI workshops in far-north Queensland, Australia will develop a systems-based approach to target student training in a range of disciplines related to coral reef science and conservation. Students will have the unique opportunity to interact with experts in a range of fields, including, but not limited to, ecology, biogeochemistry, physiology, animal behavior, molecular biology, and environmental social science. Students will first learn about socio-ecological resilience and anthropogenic impacts on natural systems at the School for Field Studies (SFS), Centre for Rainforest Studies (CRS) in the Atherton Tablelands (7 days), the only place in the world where land and ocean-based UNESCO World Heritage Sites meet (Daintree Rainforest and Great Barrier Reef). The group will then travel to the Lizard Island Research Station (LIRS), a state-of-the-art, island-based research facility in the northern Great Barrier Reef (14 days), where students will learn from and be guided through independent research projects by a diverse group of American and Australian coral reef scientists. Through lectures, class work, field immersions, and independent projects, these ASIs will engage students in hands-on research that fosters a transdisciplinary understanding of coral reef ecosystems. This pioneering program will teach students how holistic approaches are critical to addressing human impacts on ecosystems while preparing them to address the next big-picture scientific problems. The international location will provide students with valuable networking and professional development, broadening the students´ career opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the minute scale where such phenomena occur, however, the information carriers, such as atoms, are fragile and highly susceptible to noise. In order to build scalable and reliable quantum systems, one needs to mitigate noise through error-correction techniques. A quantum error correcting code (QECC) encodes data in a larger mathematical space so that the redundancy can be use to detect and correct errors. For quantum computation, one needs to regularly do such error correction, which tries to preserve data as it is, while also performing active computation to process the data, which keeps altering it. In order to be fault-tolerant, such a quantum computer needs to find ways of carefully balancing computation and decoding (error correction) while keeping resource requirements at a minimum. This is a very challenging task, and this project develops methods to study modern QECCs that are optimized for the dynamics between encoded computation and decoding using techniques from classical error-correction theory. The team will also nurture young talent in these areas and inspire underrepresented groups to join the growing quantum workforce.<br/><br/>The celebrated threshold theorem of QEC established that quantum information can be protected indefinitely as long as each hardware component meets a fidelity threshold that is a function of the specific QECC. This project will provide a concrete understanding of desirable code structure, motivated by practical constraints, and hence address both thresholds and computational overhead as a function of this structure. Specifically, the intellectual contributions of the proposed research plan can be summarized as follows: (1) Recent results of investigators have produced systematic methods to synthesize logical operations on stabilizer codes. The team of researchers will begin by applying such methods to quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes in order to understand their utility for logical computation. (2) The team will explore strategies such as concatenation and lifting algebraic protographs to combine the best aspects of QLDPC codes and algebraic codes such as quantum Reed-Muller codes. (3) For QEC, it has been observed that iterative decoders with symmetric message updates fail on QLDPC codes due to cycles and ""quantum"" trapping sets related to error degeneracy. The team will leverage their classical expertise to develop single-shot algorithms based on message-passing with noisy syndromes, understand the effect of non-linear message updates, and analyze error floors. (4) The investigators will also determine how the desirable graph structure for such methods interplay with realizing logical operations on these hybrid QECCs. Finally, the team will combine these insights with other promising approaches such as measurement-based quantum computation, which will make the results apply across a wide array of technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lack of source code for most commercial software makes it necessary to analyze and defend software binaries. However, unlike source code, binaries are devoid of rich semantic information that is crucial for security. Traditional binary analysis and reverse engineering approaches are limited by factors such as obfuscation, choice of compiler and compilation flags, availability of debug information, and underlying instruction set architecture. This project bridges the semantic gap in binary analysis by leveraging the interface between a binary and its environment. Such interactions are mandated by the Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification. The project is based on the insight that ABI adherence confers certain properties to a binary that form a strong basis for reverse engineering. Because ABI adherence is necessary for interoperability, relying on ABI cues for reverse engineering offers an unprecedented level of robustness that is impervious to obfuscation and compilation environment (e.g., optimization). <br/><br/>This project utilizes two independent yet complementary mechanisms that leverage language ABIs to vastly improve the state of the art in binary analysis and code-reuse attack detection. It employs a combination of static and dynamic binary analysis approaches in order to derive high-level design information (e.g., object-oriented language class diagrams) from binaries. Such information is central to solving problems in decompilation, software specialization, software similarity detection, etc. While the project evaluates binaries that adhere to Itanium and Microsoft?s MSVC ABIs, the discovered techniques will be applicable to more modern languages such as Rust. Additionally, this project leverages System V ABI, the most popular C language ABI to derive integrity policies for binaries that run on UN*X (unix like) operating systems, and addresses modern code-reuse attacks that operate within the confines of a  statically recovered control-flow graph.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support this revolution, further technological advances are required to address ever-growing security and privacy concerns, including combating attempts by adversarial entities at tampering with communications. Despite recent advances in network security, such as public-key cryptography and various security protocols, the current design of security solutions is often governed by the assumption that an adversary is present at all times. In practice, this assumption may waste resources: even though adversaries may appear at any moment, they are not present for a majority of the time. This project explores authentication as an efficient, low-complexity approach to the security of communication systems. Authenticated communication requires transmitting a message from one location to another, so that whenever the receiver accepts a message, it can guarantee the message has not been corrupted. The hallmark of this approach is that it does not require any pre-shared secret knowledge between users, and it incurs little extra cost when an adversary is not present while providing an immediate alarm signal when one is. This research aims to foster interdisciplinary cooperation across engineering and mathematics, and will actively engage both undergraduate and graduate students across institutions.<br/><br/>The project addresses information- and coding-theoretic questions related to both fundamental performance limits and principles of optimal authentication code design, along with the application of authentication to emerging areas such as computing and machine learning. First, new fundamental limits for authentication in point-to-point communication systems are being derived, building on the research team?s preliminary work. This includes the study of Gaussian models as well as myopic channels, where the adversary sees a noisy version of the transmitted signal and may use this knowledge to inform its strategy. Next, the project is studying canonical networks by considering a novel objective of partial correction, which allows a receiver to decode a fraction of the transmitted messages, even if it must reject the remainder. These theoretical findings will also be translated into practical coding schemes for authentication. In particular, new code constructions are being developed by incorporating a controlled amount of non-linearity into existing linear coding schemes. Finally, authentication is being interpreted in and applied to the context of emerging applications such as distributed computing and dataset integrity in supervised learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major challenge in realizing the benefits of persistent memory is ensuring that software can survive system crashes without corrupting data that is stored in persistent memory.  Simply directly testing persistent-memory software is not feasible: exposing persistency bugs requires a combination of a precisely timed power failure or crash and the correct cache state.  The project?s novelties are (1) the development of a new approach to model-checking persistent-memory programs that can find persistency bugs and scale to real world code, (2) the development of formal correctness models that can ensure that code correctly persists data structures, (3) the development of a tool that can identify persistency bugs in real world code, and (4) the development of a tool that can automatically generate the necessary instructions to persist data.  The project?s impacts are that it is creating tools that help industry build reliable software that takes advantage of emerging persistent memory technologies.<br/><br/>This project develops appropriate notions of correctness for persistent-memory programs borrowing ideas from work in concurrent data structures.  These notions are sufficiently strong to ensure that persistent-memory programs correctly flush data from caches to persistent memory.  The project develops a model checker that includes an automated analysis to check persistent-memory programs with respect to these correctness notions.  This analysis can help developers both find silent bugs in persistent-memory programs and to localize a bug to a specific region of code.

You are on a conference call with speakers from multiple countries with different native languages. Even though everyone is speaking the same language, misunderstandings often happen. Given that the common language is often not the native language for all speakers, the different accents may lead to communication issues. Many people assume that these misunderstandings happen because speakers hear sounds quite similarly to native speakers but have difficulty producing the speech sounds like a native speaker (i.e., their speech is ?accented?), perhaps due to ingrained motor habits and/or less experience producing the sounds. But another possibility is that nonnative speakers produce some sounds differently from most native speakers because they actually hear those sounds differently. This research project seeks to understand how a particular speaker?s perception of speech sounds (such as the vowel sound in ?ship? vs. ?shape?) is related to that speaker?s production of the sounds. This is a particularly relevant question for second-language speakers, who often have difficulties with both perception and production. It also has ramifications for native listeners, who often have difficulties comprehending speech from second-language speakers or speakers of less-familiar dialects or with less-familiar accents. Better communication among speakers of a common language who have different language backgrounds and accents would benefit instructional contexts with international students, medical care settings, and extension of American businesses into new markets. <br/><br/>This project uses a novel research paradigm to test subtle aspects of how people perceive their own speech. Speakers for whom English is their first (or only) language and speakers who learned English as a second language will be recorded naming a set of pictures. Each participant will then hear their own or someone else?s recording, which they will need to identify. For example, they may hear their own (or someone else?s) recording of ?ship? and must select the intended word from one of four pictures: ship, shape, log, and lock. If perception is a source of communication difficulties, speakers of English as a second language should be relatively better at understanding their own speech (more accurate and faster at choosing the intended word) than the speech of others because it will match their mental representations.

In this project, Professor Hayton will develop several new applications of metal sulfides, including nitric oxide delivery, catalytic sulfur-atom transfer for organic synthesis, and quantum computing.  This research will provide excellent training to undergraduate and graduate students in the synthesis and characterization of air-sensitive metal complexes, preparing them for careers in academia, industry, and the national laboratory system.  In addition, Professor Hayton will develop a student-led virtual seminar series to introduce students to cutting-edge nanoscience.  This series will allow undergraduate students, in particular, to network with researchers from other institutions and meet potential employers. <br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Synthesis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Trevor Hayton of the University of California Santa Barbara will perform a wide-ranging investigation into metal sulfide reactivity related to a diverse set of topics, including bioinorganic chemistry, organic synthesis, and nanoscience.  In particular, his laboratory will explore the reactions metal sulfides with nitric oxide in an effort to understand the NO/H2S ?crosstalk? process, a suite of reactions between NO and sulfide/hydrosulfide in biological systems that is thought to play an important role in cell signaling and the immune response.  Additionally, they will explore the ability of the monothiopercarbonate fragment (i.e., the SOC(O)O-dianion) to function as a S-atom transfer reagent. This species is predicted to be a thermodynamically more powerful S-atom source than elemental sulfur, yet should feature good kinetic stability. Finally, they will synthesize and isolate a series of nickel sulfide atomically-precise nanoclusters (APNCs) of varying size.  This series of clusters is designed to uncover how paramagnetism emerges in transition metal nanoclusters.

Biodegradable TPEs are promising recyclable and sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact. They have the potential to be used as protective coatings for cell phones, artificial muscles for soft robotics, and polymer electrolytes for batteries. However, few of these applications have been effectively realized due to the limited understanding of TPEs' synthesis-structure-property relation. This research project aims to understand and quantify the link between synthesis, microstructure, and mechanical property of TPEs, with the help of multi-scale computational modeling, data science (machine learning), and experimental validation. With tailored mechanical properties, these biodegradable and environmentally friendly polymers can be widely used to enable an array of novel structural and device applications, alleviating the plastic pollution crisis. The project includes an education and outreach plan to train diverse groups of next-generation engineers through a variety of avenues: production of educational movies for the general public and K-12 students, engineering education for K-12 students through Pre-Engineering and Explore Engineering Programs, and providing research experience for undergraduate and graduate students, especially the underrepresented groups, through internships at industries and national labs.<br/> <br/>The research objective of this project is to formulate a machine-learned coarse-grained model for TPEs with thermodynamic consistency, temperature transferability, and representability. TPEs are segmented copolymers composed of hard segments and soft segments, forming a two-phase microstructure. Thus, the machine-learned coarse-grained model can be used to understand microphase separation and its contribution to mechanical behaviors of TPEs, leading to the well-defined synthesis-structure-property relation. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) establish the machine-learned coarse-grained model for TPEs through deep neural networks and an active learning scheme; 2) integrate coarse-grained molecular simulations and constitutive modeling to achieve a meaningful structure-property relation of TPEs; 3) explore a novel class of sequence-defined TPEs with tailored microstructures and mechanical properties. The fundamental understanding of the synthesis-structure-property relationship will highlight a clear design path for experimentalists to utilize biodegradable TPEs for a broad range of applications, e.g., sound and vibration damping materials, shape-memory materials, and adaptive solar control materials. This computational framework can be readily adapted and generalized to many other polymeric materials for understanding their structure-property relations, such as fatigue-resistant hydrogels and protein-mimetic polymers, with phase-separated microstructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to reconstruct variations in the spatial and seasonal distribution of precipitation in the western U.S. during the LIG during which global temperature are comparable to low-end 21st century projections. The project will include the application of novel methods (calcium and triple oxygen isotopes) on stalagmites from Lake Shasta Caverns (northern California) and Titan Cave (northern Wyoming), and will provide new chronological data and novel measurements (carbonate clumped and triple oxygen isotopes) at four lake sites in the northeast Great Basin (Bear Lake, Utah/Idaho and Bonneville Basin, Utah/Nevada), and southwest Great Basin/Mojave Desert (Lake Manix and Owens Lake, California). The anticipated results of this project are past records of changes in temperature, rainfall amount and moisture source and seasonality. These new past climate records will be integrated into a regional proxy-data network used to benchmark climate model simulations of the Last Interglacial period (127 ka).<br/><br/>The paleoclimate modeling intercomparison (PMIP4) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) efforts of the climate modeling community include Tier 1 LIG (127ka) simulations as a benchmarking target for models with similar CO2 levels, different orbital configuration, unchanged topography and higher sea level. The validation of hydroclimate-relevant variables at a regional scale using climate models requires robustly dated and spatially distributed paleoclimate observations in order to place the LIG water cycle in the western U.S. in the context of geologic and future climate change. Yet, few quantitative estimates of paleoclimate exist for this interval, which offers geochronologic challenges too as it is beyond the limit of radiocarbon age control. This project seeks to improve our understanding of LIG climate in the western U.S. by providing: 1) new observations from speleothem records, 2) new U-Th dating of existing lake cores, and 3) the application of novel semi-quantitative proxies for temperature, precipitation and humidity to speleothems and lake sediments. Through the development of new high-resolution proxy time-series from speleothems and lake sediments, we will provide new insight into the behavior of the North American Monsoon during a past warm period and reconstruct hydroclimatic response to abrupt climatic events during the penultimate deglaciation (Termination II) and Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS5). The research uses existing lake cores recovered and archived by previous NSF- and USGS-funded continental drilling projects, and recently collected speleothems known to span much of MIS5 and the LIG.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include quantifying regional hydroclimate changes during past warm periods and benchmarking of climate model simulations for the last interglacial. Other Broader Impacts include translating the project research outcomes via a workshop (paleo to policy) convening water resource managers, government agencies (e.g., USGS), climate and weather risk assessment and projection companies and early career paleoclimate researchers from across the U.S. This workshop will emphasize on the information that terrestrial past climate records (lake sediments, tree rings, speleothems) can provide in terms of hydroclimate data beyond the instrumental records needed by policy makers to assess climate variability and extreme events such as drought and floods. The researchers will produce a white paper, policy briefs for water resource managers and a presentation at an education and outreach session at a scientific meeting (American Geophysical Union). The project will provide scientific training, mentorship and professional development for two graduate students and one postdoctoral researcher. Through joint field trips and collaborations, these students and postdoc will have opportunities to develop interdisciplinary expertise in climate archives, novel proxy systems, geochronology and model-proxy comparison. In addition, the researchers will recruit undergraduate students to complete summer internships related to the project. The undergraduate students will be recruited through (1) the Earth Horizons program and partnership between Vanderbilt University and Tennessee State University, a Historically Black University (HBCU); (2) the Leadership Alliance program at Brown University funded through NSF-REU-EPSCOR.

The overarching goal of the project is to identify cultural strengths that support early science learning opportunities among Spanish-speaking children from immigrant Latin American communities, a population that is traditionally underrepresented in STEM educational and career pursuits. Building on a growing interest in the ways stories can promote early engagement in and understanding of science, this project will investigate the role of oral and written stories as culturally relevant and potentially powerful tools for making scientific ideas and inquiry practices meaningful and accessible for young Latinx children. Findings will reveal ways that family storytelling practices can provide accessible entry points for Latinx children's early science learning, and recommend methods that parents and educators can use to foster learning about scientific practices that can, in turn, increase interest and participation in science education and fields. <br/><br/>The project will advance knowledge on the socio-cultural and familial experience of Latinx children that can contribute to their early science learning and skills. The project team will examine the oral story and reading practices of 330 Latinx families with 3- to 5-year-old children recruited from three geographic locations in the United States: New York, Chicago, and San Jose. Combining interviews and observations, the project team will investigate: (1) how conversations about science and nature occur in Latinx children's daily lives, and (2) whether and to what extent narrative and expository books, family personal narratives, and adivinanzas (riddles) engender family conversations about scientific ideas and science practices. Across- and within-site comparisons will allow the project team to consider the immediate ecology and broader factors that shape Latinx families? science-related views and practices. Although developmental science has long acknowledged that early learning is culturally situated, most research on early STEM is still informed by mainstream experiences that largely exclude the lived experiences of children from groups underrepresented in STEM, especially those who speak languages other than English. The proposed work will advance understanding of stories as cultural resources to support early science engagement and learning among Latinx children and inform the development of high quality, equitable informal and formal science educational opportunities for young children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Catalytic hydrofunctionalization reactions provide an environmentally friendly method to convert widely available chemical feedstocks into synthetic intermediates that can easily be converted into value-added products with uses in pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and the commodity chemical industry. The project aims to uncover new catalysts that are easily produced from naturally abundant and inexpensive precursors, particularly taking advantage of Earth-abundant metals such as manganese, iron, and cobalt. This project is directly contributing to the rigorous training of both graduate students and undergraduate researchers in preparation for their careers as scientific researchers.  In efforts to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in chemistry, Professor Thomas serves as the faculty advisor to the student organization for women in chemistry at Ohio State (Females of Chemistry Uniting Scientists, FOCUS), is an active member of the NOBCChE (National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers) Collaborative, and will be launching a new summer undergraduate program in the Ohio State Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry specifically focused on providing research opportunities for underrepresented minority students (CoNQUER, Collaborative NOBCChE Quintessential Undergraduate Experience in Research).  <br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Christine Thomas at Ohio State University is studying the design of new multidentate ligand frameworks in an effort to promote metal-ligand cooperativity with Earth-abundant first row transition metals (e.g., iron, cobalt, manganese).  The project aims to uncover more sustainable catalytic methods by using metal-ligand cooperative processes as a strategy to make and break chemical bonds without relying on two-electron redox cycles that are often inaccessible to first row metals. Ligand design is at the heart of this project, and the Thomas group is evaluating several different approaches in this regard.  A tridentate PPP-based pincer ligand featuring an N-heterocyclic phosphide fragment has been shown to actively participate in metal-ligand cooperative reactions in which sigma bonds are cleaved across the metal-phosphide linkage, and ongoing studies focus on the expansion of established stoichiometric reactions and their incorporation into catalytic cycles for the hydroboration, hydrogenation, and hydrosilylation of unsaturated substrates.  In addition, Thomas?s research team is exploring a new tetradentate PNNP-based ligand that contains two amide donors as potential sites for metal-ligand cooperativity. The coordination of this ligand to Fe, Co, and Mn and the stoichiometric reactivity of the resulting (PNNP)M compounds towards the activation of substrates such as hydrogen, silanes, and boranes across the two metal-amide bonds is under investigation, with the ultimate goal of incorporating these fundamental reaction steps into catalytic hydrofunctionalization reactions. Lastly, a newly discovered metal-templated procedure for the elimination and substitution of phosphine substituents will be leveraged to synthesize an expanded family of ligands, including tetradentate ligand derivatives that feature both phosphide and amide donors as potential reactive sites, PPP- and PNNP-based ligands with more electron-rich alkyl substituents, and tridentate and tetradentate ligands with P-chiral functionalities for use in asymmetric catalysis. The new synthetic method will provide researchers in the field with a new economical and straightforward method to synthesize large families of multidentate ligand derivatives including P-chiral variants without the need for expensive precursors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems are fundamental across the sciences, but the mathematics underlying their study is very difficult, many important questions remain open, and new ideas are needed.  A main theme of this project is to use a geometric approach to bring fresh insight to this field.  Recently, the PI and collaborators used techniques from symplectic geometry to settle a longstanding question about certain dynamical systems. They showed that a particular dynamical system would take an infinite amount of energy to produce and used this to establish a new dichotomy in the set of systems: the finite-energy ones, and the rest.  This dichotomy will enable a deeper understanding of the classification of dynamical systems and should allow for the resolution of several questions that have attracted wide interest.  This project involves further research in this direction.  One goal of the project is to find a further dichotomy for the finite-energy systems.  By bringing a geometric approach to bear on questions about dynamical systems that have resisted solution by other methods, the project aims to showcase the power of these kinds of techniques.  At the same time, an idea at the heart of the approach comes from studying when one symplectic shape can be deformed into a subset of another, and research in these directions should deepen our understanding of symplectic geometry.  The project also has a substantial education component.  The PI has previously worked to broaden participation in mathematics, foster equity, and support educational efforts in the field through prison education, research training in geometry at the high school and undergraduate levels, and course design.  The project supports this work and related activities.     <br/><br/>This project involves a series of research investigations touching on the related fields of symplectic dynamics, symplectic embeddings, and continuous symplectic geometry.

The project aims to further develop this theory and solve several longstanding questions; for example, to prove an analogue of the Simplicity Conjecture in higher genus.

Their eruptions imperil local communities as well as domestic and international air traffic. Such arcs are also of scientific interest because they are the geological setting in which new continental crust forms. Our understanding of the subterranean plumbing of volcanoes has recently evolved. From the simple picture of a single magma chamber, the image of a complex system of interconnected chambers at all levels in the Earth?s crust has emerged. Investigating these deep structures in detail is critical to better understand volcanoes and their associated hazards. However, such investigation has been challenging because of technical limitations. Here the researchers use a new method. In collaboration with the Alaska Volcano Observatory, they use seismic records of earthquakes occurring around the globe. By analyzing the whole shape of recorded waveforms ? instead of just the arrival times - they image the 3D magmatic structure underneath volcanoes. They reveal important features, e.g., the orientation of crystals in solidified magma and of melt-filled cracks in the adjacent rocks. New observations show complex subterranean structures that appear concentric around volcanoes, detected at all depth levels of the crust. The project helps improving hazard assessment for local communities, infrastructures as well as air traffic routes.  It fosters outreach to K-12 science teachers, and to the public through the Museum of the Aleutians in Unalaska with, notably, a local television broadcast. It also promotes training for undergraduate students via programs geared towards groups underrepresented in Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>Island arcs are of interest in tectonics as sites of continental crust production. Volcanoes in the Aleutians and Alaska offer an excellent cross section of types of arc volcanism. This project leverages recent updates to existing monitoring networks at Alaskan volcanoes. It tests a new approach for passive source imaging of magmatic systems under arc volcanoes through all crustal depths. The proposed work is to develop a new waveform-based method for detailed imaging and characterization of volcanic structures into the deep crust.  It uses sparse numbers of broadband stations, complementing more expensive active source experiments and dense deployments. The approach also uses large arrivals in teleseismic receiver functions from the vicinity of arc volcanoes that are dominated by a periodic backazimuthal component (polarity reversals with azimuth of incidence). The positions of the polarity reversals fall on azimuths that are concentric to the volcanic edifice. The observed arrivals imply dipping contrasts between isotropic layers and/or anisotropic fabric centered on the volcano to at least midcrustal depths. Recent station upgrades to monitoring networks by the Alaska Volcano Observatory more than double the number of volcanoes available for study.  A modeling effort will help distinguish between several endmember models of transcrustal magmatic structure that have been proposed to explain results from other methods such as petrology, tomography, geodesy, magnetotellurics, and seismicity relocations. These endmember models include dipping interfaces to high- or low-velocity crustal bodies, dipping faults above magma chambers, and dip in dike and sill complexes. The added constraints offered by the proposed method will allow higher resolution magmatic structures throughout the crust than currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One goal of this research is to develop a meaningful understanding of the structures and fluxional behavior of these complexes and, likewise an understanding of the mechanisms through which these complexes undergo electrophilic deauration (loss of gold). In doing so, these activities will provide mechanistic insight that will serve the ever growing global community of researchers working toward (1) the development of new and more efficient gold(I) catalyzed transformations and (2) elucidation of the mechanisms of gold(I)-catalyzed transformations. The proposed research activities are fully integrated into the scientific education and training of the graduate and undergraduate student researchers, including students from ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Graduate students are encouraged to augment their graduate research and educational experience through participation in educational activities offered through the Duke University Graduate School.

Specifically, it is designed to advance understanding about how students' sense of belonging develops in undergraduate learning experiences outside of the traditional classroom. The project will focus on residential undergraduate field courses, a pivotal learning experience in STEM disciplines such as ecology, geology, and geography. A sense of belonging plays an important role in students' mental health and well-being, academic achievement and motivation, and institution-level retention.  It is also pivotal for the persistence of students from communities that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The overarching goal of the project is to build the capacity of geosciences and biology faculty to support the development of students' sense of belonging.  In this way, it can help to improve the inclusivity of courses that are a critical pathway for thousands of undergraduate students in field-based STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This project has the potential for broad reach and impact on student engagement and learning in multiple STEM disciplines and is likely to have a positive impact on the inclusivity of undergraduate field education.  It may be especially important for students from communities that have been historically excluded from field-based STEM disciplines, whose persistence is strongly linked to sense of belonging in the scientific community. The project focuses on advancing understanding about how students' sense of belonging develops in residential field experiences and builds capacity for faculty from geosciences and biology to support the growth of students' sense of belonging. The following objectives will guide the project study: 1) Identify factors that contribute to and hinder the development of students' sense of belonging during residential geosciences and biology undergraduate field courses; 2) Characterize the design and implementation of geosciences and biology undergraduate field courses, specifically what practices faculty are using and what challenges and needs exist for the development of students' sense of belonging during undergraduate field courses; 3) Create  an empirically-based framework of how students' sense of belonging develops during residential  undergraduate field courses; 4) Facilitate a Community of Practice that uses and contributes to promising practices for the design and assessment of inclusive field courses that support the development of students' sense of belonging; and 5) Articulate a suite of promising practices that have the potential to promote the development of students' sense of belonging during a range of formats of undergraduate field courses and for students from different backgrounds. Using innovative and robust mixed methods research approaches, this work will contribute to the wider body of evidence-based, student-centered practices in undergraduate STEM education. The work has the potential to provide a deep and impactful contribution to the fields of discipline-based education research (particularly in geosciences and biology), higher education, education and social psychology, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Constraints related to chemical composition and geographical distribution of both the feedstocks and products require the development of innovative catalytic strategies that can take advantage of these new resources. Motivated by the continuous growth of cost-competitive renewable electric power, the use of electrochemical strategies to enable the activation of hydrocarbon resources provides a unique opportunity to reduce the environmental impact and cost of chemical manufacturing by avoiding the high pressures and temperatures synonymous with thermally driven chemical transformations. Furthermore, the electrochemical approach is more resistant to major disruption events that pose resilience and safety threats in traditional chemical manufacturing supply chains. Therefore, the development of electrically driven chemical reaction strategies in this research program has significant transformative potential. Direct electrochemical catalytic upgrading of hydrocarbon resources, however, currently is limited by both slow reaction rates and poor selectivity to desired products. This study will advance the development of catalytic resonance, whereby the energetics of a catalyst is modulated in time to maximize the reaction rate and selectivity towards the desired product. This study will integrate concepts of sustainable chemical transformation, renewable energy sources, and catalytic kinetics into an educational plan that will engage students both at UMass and the surrounding area. The impact of outreach efforts will be expanded by developing educational online content, using simple and effective teaching techniques to communicate the fundamental science behind energy related applications.<br/><br/>This study will focus on developing a fundamental understanding of catalytic resonance for the electrochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons into value-added oxygenates. While renewable and cost-effective energy to drive the electrochemical reactions is readily available, the rate of catalytic turnover associated with the electrochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, alkenes) limits the approach. Metal catalysts that do exhibit appreciable electrocatalytic activity are plagued by the lack of selectivity to partial oxidation products due to the over-oxidation of hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide as an undesirable product. Under steady-state conditions, the challenges to catalytic activity and selectivity share a similar origin: balancing the necessary adsorbate coverages, kinetic driving force, and the combination of faradaic and non-faradaic elementary steps involved in the catalytic cycle. Controlled energetic oscillations of the catalytic working electrode decouples the rate-determining factors, allowing for their independent tuning by accessing non-equilibrium states that cannot be sustained under static conditions. While this study will focus on hydrocarbon oxidation, the work will develop the understanding and capabilities needed for extending the concept of catalytic resonance to other important chemical transformations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research has shown that the use of pictorial examples during the presentation of design problems can support the learning of engineering principles and design constraints. But it can also bias designers and engineering design students toward replicating the examples they were shown, even in the presence of explicit instructions not to do so, rather than seeking innovative alternative solutions. This phenomenon is known as design fixation?the tendency to adhere to elements of prior ideas or solutions to a problem. Design fixation is a significant barrier to the generation of new design ideas and creative problem solving. Intriguingly, preliminary research on engineering education has suggested there is a disciplinary difference in the tendency to show design fixation to pictorial examples, such that industrial designers are markedly less likely to fixate than are mechanical engineers. The goal of this project, a collaboration between cognitive neuroscience researchers at Drexel University and design scientists at the University of North Carolina, is to focus on this difference as a means of understanding the cognitive and neural processes underlying design fixation. The driving hypothesis is that, as a result of their training, mechanical engineering students are more likely to fixate because they are less apt to draw on abstract principles. The studies will involve a combination of behavioral and brain imaging studies of first year and fourth year undergraduate students in different design disciplines. The results of this project will have the potential to generalize across much of STEM education by informing the development of curricula to ward off design fixation. This award is made by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>Drawing on the research literature in cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, engineering education, and design science, this project will examine the premise that there are differences between undergraduate industrial design and mechanical engineering students in their tendencies to show design fixation and that these differences are arise from instruction that emphasizes the of abstraction (rule-based) learning in the former discipline and exemplar-based learning in the latter. The project will examine whether differences between students during concept building, captured by both behavioral and neural measures, can predict design fixation patterns. The researchers will collect multimodal data from first year and senior industrial design and mechanical engineering students on a design fixation task and a control design task. They will quantify design fixation behaviorally through (a) the coding of sketches according to an established design categorization scheme, and (b) the coding of verbal protocols with the established Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) ontology for design. The FBS ontology segmentation and coding of verbal protocols will then be used in a novel attempt to analyze neural responses during the design fixation and control tasks. The behavioral and neural differences in learning tendencies ? rule-based and exemplar based ? between students in the two disciplines will then be used to predict behavioral and neural differences in design fixation. Ultimately, the investigators aim to put forth a mechanistic account of design fixation, grounded in cognitive neuroscience and design theory and practice, that will inform the development of instructional interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transition-metal photocatalysts are crucial components in organic synthesis and in systems for the conversion of solar energy into electricity and/or chemical fuels.  Professor Wagenknecht aims to use complexes of earth-abundant elements to replace precious metal photocatalysts.  Transition-metal phosphors are essential components of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).  The development of phosphors for OLEDs in Professor Wagenknecht?s group involves a set of complexes designed to enhance blue emission, which remains a technical challenge.  These complexes also show promise for the development of single-component white OLEDs (WOLEDs). Students involved in the proposed activities will be trained in methods directly related to device chemistry and the conversion of solar energy to stored chemical energy.  This will result in the development of a STEM workforce prepared to solve problems of serious social significance.  Students in the Professor Wagenknecht?s laboratory are also active in after-hours tutoring programs and/or providing chemistry demonstrations to local elementary and middle schools.  They are also active in outreach to high school students and high school teachers.   <br/><br/>Recent reports demonstrate that complexes of earth-abundant metals with ligand-to-metal charge transfer excited states represent a new class of possible photocatalysts.

New alkynyl-titanocenes with rigid structures and/or with Cu(I) coordinated between the alkynes are proposed to have higher stability and longer excited-state lifetimes and will be compared to those without such modification.  This could lead to a stronger understanding of the photophysical principles necessary to design first-row  transition-metal sensitizers.  Professor Wagenknecht?s group has developed a titanocene precursor with carboxylate anchoring groups so that a range of titanocenes can be prepared and appended to titanium dioxide to investigate their possible use as sensitizers in DSSCs and investigate principles of charge injection.  The Pt-alkynyl complexes proposed are being prepared to mechanistically investigate the role of the trifluoropropynyl ligand in blue-shifting emission while maintaining high phosphorescence quantum yields.

As an example, saline fluids inside the Earth in the upper mantle may play an important role in connecting subduction zones at depth and volcanism at the surface. How this happens is still mysterious. One reason for this is that there are no experimental data for how such fluids interact chemically with upper mantle rocks, even though saline fluids are preserved in diamonds and rocks from the deep Earth. The proposed research seeks to understand the role of chloride in saline fluids. For example, the potential for chloride to transport metals under upper mantle conditions is highly intriguing. How important is this process? What are the impacts on changing the upper mantle through time, the generation of melts, the long-term stability of continental roots, and the types of volcanism at the surface of Earth? Answering these questions will help unravel the reasons for the special features of Earth and its near-surface environment that contribute to Earth's habitability as well as helping to provide a basis for the prediction of the potential habitability of other planets. This is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation?s Directorate of Geosciences (NSF-GEO) and the Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) in accord with the language in the Memorandum of Understanding between the NSF and the BSF. This Agreement allows a single collaborative proposal, involving US and Israeli investigators, to be submitted and peer-reviewed by NSF. Upon successful results of the NSF merit review and recommendation by the cognizant NSF Program of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own country.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the composition and evolution of saline fluids in the upper mantle. A unique combination of experimental, thermodynamic modeling, and observational studies are proposed to examine the origins and roles of Cl-rich fluids in diamond formation and mantle metasomatism. The Israeli participants bring two vital areas of expertise to the project, namely the experimental expertise needed to measure the solubilities of mantle rocks in chloride solutions and the expertise in analyzing fluid inclusions in diamonds. These two areas of expertise are buttressed by the resources provided in the experimental laboratory for high pressure-temperature rock solubilities and the analytical laboratory for fluid inclusion analysis. Theoretical analysis of the experimental solubilities and published single mineral solubilities will be integrated with data from lower temperature and pressure experimental and spectroscopic studies to expand the calibration of metal-chloride complexes in the Deep Earth Water (DEW) model.

One example, the US Geological Survey?s Landsat Earth observation program, collects about a terabyte of data daily, and their 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) is working toward generating the first-ever high-detail elevation dataset for the entire country, which is scheduled to be completed by 2023. While these ?big data? projects present many opportunities, it is currently very difficult to extract actionable information from them in an efficient manner that supports scientific research and informed decision making. While recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning show great promise in analyzing such data, there is a need to further research and develop these techniques for application to digital mapping tasks, such as detecting landslides, monitoring resource extraction, and documenting landscape change. This research will develop state-of-the-art ?deep learning?-based techniques to derive valuable information on human modifications to the landscape using geospatial data, including elevation models and historic maps, to fundamentally advance geomorphic mapping science. In addition to supporting and training graduate students at West Virginia University, the work will engage future high school STEM teachers, in-service teachers, and high school students by developing training and instructional materials that will help enable the next generation of data scientists, geospatial professionals, and coders.<br/><br/>This project will advance the application of geospatial data analytics and advanced computational methods to extract high spatial resolution information from geospatial data over wide regions to further understanding of natural landscapes and anthropogenic landscape change. It specifically explores semantic and instance segmentation deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are able to model spatial context information, for extracting geomorphic features and historic mining from geospatial data, including historic topographic maps, light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, and additional terrain representations (i.e., hillshades and other topographic derivatives). Ultimately, this project will contribute to operationalizing deep learning for geomorphic mapping using the increasing abundance of quality digital terrain data with the eventual goal of generating accurate datasets at regional to global extents that will allow for documentation, quantification, and modeling of geomorphic hazards and natural and anthropogenic landscape change.

However, new sampling and emerging environmental genetic approaches, such as environmental DNA (eDNA), offer great promise for studying biodiversity in challenging ecosystems. Environmental DNA is DNA that is left in the environment by the organisms that live there. With modern techniques it is possible to isolate and sequence this DNA to identify, monitor, and study the organisms living in many different habitats. This project will harness traditional, eDNA, and genomic approaches to identify patterns and drivers of biodiversity within and among cave groundwater habitats in the central and eastern United States. In addition, this project will explore how aquatic cave organisms have responded to changes to their habitats that are associated with human impacts on groundwater both spatially and over time. Best practices for employing eDNA and its integration with genomic approaches in the study of aquatic cave ecosystems will be developed. Research will directly involve K-12 students and educators, undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and community scientists, with an emphasis on groups that are grossly underrepresented in caving and science through several educational and outreach programs, including a student-focused community-science initiative for aquatic cave biodiversity monitoring, grades 3?5 educational summer camps, an undergraduate student research and training program, and teacher workshops. Finally, this project will support the development of an online data portal for groundwater and cave biodiversity data and resources for future research and support conservation and management efforts.<br/><br/>This project will harness a large, existing specimen and tissue collection and integrate traditional and eDNA sampling with genomic approaches, such as ultraconserved elements and restriction site-associated DNA sequencing, to compare levels of species and genetic diversity at different scales within and among three diverse karst biogeographic regions in the central and eastern United States to better understand spatial patterns and the underlying processes that shape them. In addition, the effects of human impacts in land use on spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity in groundwater populations and communities will be examined using population genomic approaches. Finally, the integration of eDNA with genomic approaches will be studied to explore the application of eDNA in providing insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of groundwater species and communities using time-series analysis of sediment cores in caves. Groundwater ecosystems are particularly attractive for such studies, as the lack of UV radiation, stable temperatures, and generally low microbial activity in groundwater habitats may promote long-term eDNA persistence.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Systematics and Biodiversity Science program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many trace metals, which are by definition present in very low amounts, are essential for life and thus considered nutrients for phytoplankton growth. Other elements can be useful for tracing other ocean processes, and some (such as lead) are important because they are pollutants. This project will address three main objectives: 1) to measure the dissolved concentrations and size partitioning of micronutrients iron, manganese, zinc, copper, cadmium, nickel, and pollutant lead in seawater from Tahiti towards Antarctica and then back northeast to South America; 2) to analyze the isotope ratios - the relative abundance of different forms of the same chemical element - of iron, zinc, cadmium, nickel, and copper in seawater, suspended particles, aerosols, and porewaters from this section, as isotopes provide diagnostic insights into sources, sinks, and metal transformations beyond what is provided by concentration measurements alone; and 3) to use ocean models to constrain the rates of ocean processes and effects of ocean circulation on trace metal and isotope distributions. This project spans three US labs, and four graduate students and several undergraduate students will participate. It will also provide ultrafiltered samples and data to several other collaborating groups as a service.<br/><br/><br/>The U.S. GEOTRACES GP17-OCE expedition, planned for late 2021 or 2022, aims to determine the distribution of trace elements and isotopes along a transect spanning regions of global importance to nutrient and carbon cycling, crossing the South Pacific Gyre, the iron-limited waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, Pacific Deep Waters with hydrothermal inputs, and waters near the Chilean margin. The South Pacific Gyre and Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean are climate-critical regions for the transfer of heat, carbon, and nutrients within the global ocean, and they are a region where phytoplankton growth is typically limited by low concentrations of iron (Fe) in the surface ocean. The investigators will use a variety of analytical approaches, along with analyses made by other project collaborators, to address four major objectives related to dissolved micronutrient biogeochemistry in this region: 1) What are the relative fluxes of dissolved metals from dust, sediments, and Antarctic continental inputs to surface waters of the South Pacific gyre and ACC waters? 2) What fluxes of trace metals, especially Fe, are delivered by Pacific Deep Water to the Southern Ocean for upwelling to the surface waters? Are these fluxes hydrothermal or benthic in origin? Are dissolved metals supplied by the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge to the abyssal Southern Ocean? 3) How do micronutrient metal uptake stoichiometries change across gradients of primary production, community composition, and nutrient limitation from the gyre to ACC waters? How are these affected by metal speciation? 4) How do pre-formed biological signatures in surface waters, combined with regeneration and scavenging along the transport path, influence the regional and global distribution of TEIs?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanographenes are flat sheets of carbon atoms that mimic small sections of graphene. The optoelectronic properties of nanographenes make them attractive materials in applications such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells. The Chalifoux research group?s efforts to develop new ways to make these molecules are supporting the design of next-generation devices. Dr. Chalifoux and his team of students are converting modifiable chemical building blocks to nanographenes under mild conditions and monitoring how specific changes in the building blocks tune the characteristics of the nanographenes, including their three-dimensional shape and optical properties. These activities are also supporting the engagement of high school students in chemical research to encourage their engagement in science and to support their progression towards successful science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers.<br/><br/>Wesley Chalifoux and his research team are advancing the use of alkyne benzannulation as a mild and versatile strategy for preparing nanographenes with tunable optical properties. The use of high-energy alkyne-containing precursors allows for the use of mild benzannulation conditions that support expanded functional group tolerance and provide access to a variety of nanographene structures that cannot be achieved using other methods. The Chalifoux group will apply this strategy to the synthesis of highly contorted and chiral nanographene molecular scaffolds that exhibit circularly polarized light characteristics and can be envisioned in variety of chiroptic applications such as liquid crystal displays, chiral sensing, holographic displays, three-dimensional displays, and other information technologies. The development of new C-H functionalization strategies will also be explored in combination with benzannulation to provide new and potentially facile routes to larger nanographenes that exhibit significant red shifts in the absorption and emission spectra.

Working in the Magdalena River basin, Colombia, students will learn cutting-edge field, remote sensing, and computational tools, develop critical and systems thinking, and complete team-based research projects. Students will work with instructors from University of Montana, University of Colorado, and Colombia, taking advantage of long-term research sites in the Magdalena River basin and broad expertise.

There is a strong disconnect, however, between where research and teaching about fluvial processes is concentrated, and where stresses on river systems such as new dam construction and associated impacts on humans and biodiversity are more recently evolving, such as in the Andes. Moreover, innovative and interdisciplinary approaches are needed to address challenges such as those surrounding river systems and to prepare students for the 21st century workforce. To address these challenges, we propose Rivers of the Andes Field Training (RAFT), a course to be taught in Colombia that will provide field-based training in river sciences. Course content will focus on hydrology and fluvial geomorphology, especially river mechanics, floods, and sediment regimes, and complementary content in tropical fish ecology and basin-scale, cumulative-impact and decision-support analysis.  RAFT will use the Magdalena River and its tributaries as a field site to illustrate broader content about river processes and Andean rivers. The course will augment field training with classroom teaching about fluvial processes and observational, measurement and modeling approaches for understanding river processes. RAFT will provide a transformative experience for graduate student participants by combining innovative approaches and technologies with evidence-based best practices to not only advance knowledge of river sciences and associated tools, but also to promote critical and systems thinking and observational, interdisciplinary, and teamwork skills. RAFT will include international and multicultural experience, interdisciplinary teaching on cutting-edge process knowledge and tools, training in cross-scale and systems thinking, team-based projects, and practice in science communication.

It is considered a hallmark feature of the human mind, but metacognition is also susceptible to error. Adult humans and children often mistakenly assume they have learned material better than they really have, or they mistakenly trust that they can remember something that they will likely forget. Metacognition emerges fairly slowly in human development and is not fully evident until the age of six years (or even older). Young students who are learning new facts and skills and those in the workforce who are training in new techniques need to be able to engage in metacognitive control and monitoring. Decision makers in business and politics must know how to deal with ?known unknowns? by recognizing potential errors in their thinking and adjusting behavior to reduce uncertainty. Understanding how younger and older children engage in metacognition similarly or differently can provide insights into normal developmental paths for this important skill. It is also deeply debated as to whether species other than humans can think about their own thinking. If they can do this, it would inform issues of animal welfare, ethics, and a reconsideration of whether metacognition critically relies on language or other uniquely human cognitive capacities. Understanding whether non-verbal species can perform metacognitive tasks will provide insights into the essential or perhaps non-essential role of language, culture, and formal education in metacognitive abilities. These efforts can inform new approaches to improve study habits in students and improve self-guided routines for those learning skills such as visual classification (for example, ?is that a tumor in this x-ray, or not, or is it too hard to tell and I need to look for other information??). These studies will also refine animal models of metacognition, introduce new tests of metacognitive control in children, and illustrate the strengths or weaknesses of metacognition in children and monkeys. The data will inform efforts to train metacognitive strategies in groups that show an impairment in this ability such as those struggling to learn new information because they cannot gauge their own uncertainty (e.g., students) and those who feel overconfident in situations where they truly do not know enough to stop studying or learning (e.g., trainees in new professions).<br/><br/>This project presents computer tasks to preschool and early elementary school children, human adults, capuchin monkeys, and rhesus monkeys. Individuals perform primary goals such as remembering information or judging picture sizes or colors while also considering how well they are doing at those tasks. Some tasks assess how these groups use internal feelings such as fluency (for example, how easily a memory comes to mind) to monitor their cognition. Some tasks assess whether individuals can anticipate future memory problems and commit themselves to re-study material when they are at risk of forgetting. Other tasks assess whether individuals can use strategies to make difficult-to-remember information easier to remember or to selectively eliminate hard-to-remember material from a test so that they can perform better overall. These techniques are designed to track two important aspects of metacognition. One is the ability to monitor cognition for potential moments of uncertainty and difficulty. For example, this happens when someone knows they cannot answer a question because the right answer is not retrievable in memory, or they simply do not know the answer. An equally important but less well understood aspect involves the control strategies that are engaged when one must overcome uncertainty or difficulty. These include strategies to seek more information before choosing or deciding, to study material longer to learn it better, or even to recruit help from others when unsure. Ultimately, monitoring and control of cognition are essential to a well-educated and well-trained population. As part of this project to assess monitoring and control of cognition, the investigators will be training and mentoring a new generation of scientists to engage in research with children and nonhuman animals, and the results of this project will be shared with the public through traditional and social media outlets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of the project is to identify cultural strengths that support early science learning opportunities among Spanish-speaking children from immigrant Latin American communities, a population that is traditionally underrepresented in STEM educational and career pursuits. Building on a growing interest in the ways stories can promote early engagement in and understanding of science, this project will investigate the role of oral and written stories as culturally relevant and potentially powerful tools for making scientific ideas and inquiry practices meaningful and accessible for young Latinx children. Findings will reveal ways that family storytelling practices can provide accessible entry points for Latinx children's early science learning, and recommend methods that parents and educators can use to foster learning about scientific practices that can, in turn, increase interest and participation in science education and fields. <br/><br/>The project will advance knowledge on the socio-cultural and familial experience of Latinx children that can contribute to their early science learning and skills. The project team will examine the oral story and reading practices of 330 Latinx families with 3- to 5-year-old children recruited from three geographic locations in the United States: New York, Chicago, and San Jose. Combining interviews and observations, the project team will investigate: (1) how conversations about science and nature occur in Latinx children's daily lives, and (2) whether and to what extent narrative and expository books, family personal narratives, and adivinanzas (riddles) engender family conversations about scientific ideas and science practices. Across- and within-site comparisons will allow the project team to consider the immediate ecology and broader factors that shape Latinx families? science-related views and practices. Although developmental science has long acknowledged that early learning is culturally situated, most research on early STEM is still informed by mainstream experiences that largely exclude the lived experiences of children from groups underrepresented in STEM, especially those who speak languages other than English.

The most recent statewide data indicate a massive gap in availability of these trained biotechnicians, with an annual average production in Los Angeles county of only ~50 individuals. The largest demand is for quality control and manufacturing technicians. This project will help fill this demand by providing comprehensive training and internships in biomanufacturing, a process that uses cells (or parts of cells) to produce useful products such as proteins.  The biotechnology industry is one of the sectors that has been most resilient and least impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, people from the communities served by the college, including students who are Hispanic, have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

By accomplishing this goal, the project will provide a pipeline for students from high school to two-year college, and then to employment or transfer to a four-year biomanufacturing program. To create the program, three new courses will be developed, implemented, and evaluated. Complementing the coursework, the project will establish a student-centered Contract Manufacturing Organization that will provide internship opportunities for students in protein biomanufacturing. The protein (Taq polymerase) will be produced by student interns working in college laboratories, and provided at low cost to local high school and community college bioscience classrooms, as well as to national course-based undergraduate research experiences programs, including the DNA Learning Center?s DNA Barcoding experience and the Amgen Biotech Experience.

Any software that simplifies the computational gymnastics of analyzing data is welcomed, as it allows scientists to focus more of their attention on what they want to compute, rather than how, but there is usually a tension between ease of use and computational speed. Faster computation means more data analyzed, but error-free code matters most. Awkward Array is a software library that performs calculations on data that do not fit into neat rows. For instance, a fleet of undersea probes may each measure ocean temperatures at a different number of depths, but data analysis tools like Excel, Pandas, and SQL require measurements to be arranged in rectangular tables with the same number of columns in each row. The problem is more acute when variable numbers of measurements are nested within variable numbers of entities. Traditionally, scientists have either used slow scripting languages or unforgiving ""bare metal"" languages to perform calculations on these non-tabular datasets. Awkward Array generalizes array concepts so that the easy and fast expressions that once applied only to rectangular tables now apply to irregularly shaped data, allowing bare metal speed in a high-level scripting language. This project broadens the applicability of Awkward Array beyond the problem domain it was originally intended for, particle physics, to a wide variety of scientific fields, including oceanography, astronomy, genetics, chemistry, and health care. It also integrates the Awkward Array library with popular data science and machine learning tools and extends the implementation to GPUs for extremely fast processing of the same array idioms.<br/><br/>Scientists use NumPy-based tools, such as Pandas, to analyze large and regularly shaped data efficiently. Packing tables of numbers into contiguous arrays allows operations to be precompiled and fast; and expressing operations as concise commands with implicit loops makes them easier to read and quicker to type during data exploration. However, scientific data often has a complexity that does not fit well into tabular format. This forces scientists to write programs with explicit loops, which are slow in Python. But what about analysis of large and irregularly shaped data? Awkward Array is a generalization of NumPy; it is a Python library defining arrays of objects with arbitrary types and a suite of generic operations on them. Like NumPy arrays, Awkward Arrays are packed into contiguous buffers for efficiency, but unlike NumPy arrays, they can include variable-length lists, nested fields, missing values, and mixed types. Awkward Arrays use 10 times less memory than equivalent Python objects and are up to 100 times faster in computations. This project generalizes Awkward Array as a foundational library for science. It is a cross-disciplinary effort, extending Awkward Array to efficiently solve challenges faced by scientists in a variety of fields and data science in industry. The project members work with scientific collaborators to solve specific problems, adding features to Awkward Array if necessary, and industry collaborators at Anaconda and Nvidia update Python?s standard tools to recognize these new array types for CPU and GPU workloads.

Luckily, our motor systems usually operate seamlessly in concert with our perceptual and cognitive processes. Despite how they work together in the real world, these aspects of behavior have been largely studied separately in the laboratory. While that approach allows scientific rigor and has provided significant insights into each subsystem, it says little about their interaction, which may be fundamental to understanding human behavior. A better understanding of how the temporal aspects of perceptual, cognitive, and motor behaviors are interrelated also has the potential to advance technological innovations, e.g., in cognitive neural prosthetics, a novel human-computer interface for helping paralyzed patients and patients with amputations. Identifying the temporal interactions among cognitive, perceptual, and motor functions has other translational potential for developing new rehabilitation paradigms for populations with impaired motor and perceptual timing. <br/><br/>This research program aims to evaluate whether and how timing in perception and motor control involves shared mechanisms that ensure seamless integration and plastic co-modification. The experimental approach combines a motor skill, throwing a ball in an augmented reality environment, with a time perception task. Objective 1 explores how motor timing that emerges from discrete throwing actions modifies perceptual timing. Objective 2 extends this question to situations requiring rhythmic throwing actions. Objective 3 examines whether learned coupling of motor and perceptual timing persists in the longer term. Taken together, this quantitative approach to understanding the connections between perceptual and motor timing will contribute to developing a unified theory of timing control in real-world contexts. The female investigator team has also identified multiple outreach activities to foster and communicate the integration of scientific research and STEM education and to increase minority representation in the cognitive, perceptual, and motor sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This REU Site (1) engages students in independent, leading-edge biomaterials research projects conducted in multidisciplinary and collaborative laboratory environments; (2) provides mentoring opportunities and network-building experiences to excite participants about the societal impacts of careers available to them following graduate education; (3) prepares students to be effective communicators to public and scientific audiences, and (4) creates a welcoming and diverse training environment that promotes the inclusion of all participants. Complementing training in cutting-edge research techniques, students receive one-on-one mentoring from faculty advisors and graduate student mentors and participate in technical writing workshops and team-building activities. A signature element of the REU Site is its career mentoring initiative for doctoral-level industrial and academic career paths, further emphasizing the importance and benefits of graduate education in STEM disciplines. Students also give regular presentations about their research and deliver a formal presentation at a culminating, university-wide research symposium. The REU Site leadership especially encourages the participation of students with limited research opportunities, women, underrepresented minorities, and disabilities to expand their access to these career-enhancing opportunities. With the support of faculty and graduate student mentors and their peers, students develop and enhance their skills in essential areas such as networking, working in research teams, and communicating orally and technically in various formats. Best practices emerging from this REU Site are broadly disseminated via the web and educational publications to enable replication at other future REU sites.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Biomaterials are increasingly designed to be stimulus-responsive, where their properties can change in a controlled way in response to thermal, chemical, or mechanical stimuli in their environment. These interactions between materials and the biological environment, which occur at atomic, molecular, cellular, microscopic, and macroscopic levels, dictate biomaterials? performance both in vitro and in vivo. The research projects available to students advance knowledge of these fundamental interactions in areas that include: shape memory and stimulus-responsive polymers, nanoparticle drug delivery, the collective behavior of bacterial biofilms, cell-biomaterial interactions, stem-cell research, biocompatible soft robots, 3D printing of microfluidic devices, and computational modeling of biomaterials. These hypothesis-driven, multidisciplinary research projects draw upon the collective expertise of faculty, and in many cases, foster collaborative research across faculty laboratories, academic departments, and institutions. Faculty mentors are highly qualified to mentor undergraduate students in their laboratories; each has a vast array of modern facilities, equipment, and computational resources at their disposal for training these students in cutting-edge research using analytical and computational techniques. Students develop technical skills and expertise to appreciate the complexity of these interactive biomaterials and understand how to harness these materials for advanced technologies, preparing them to pursue advanced study for careers in various sectors and settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analyzing the vast amount of visual data is a challenge. Existing computer vision methods require fast computers that are beyond the computational capabilities of many edge devices. This project aims to improve the efficiency of computer vision methods so that they can run on battery-powered edge devices. Based on the visual data and complementary metadata (e.g., geographical location, local time), the project first extracts contextual information (such as a city street is expected to be busy at rush hour). The contextual information can help assist determine whether analysis results are correct. For example, a wild animal is not expected on a city street. Moreover, contextual information can improve efficiency.  Only certain pixels need to be analyzed (pixels on the road are useful for detecting cars, while pixels in the sky are not) and this can significantly reduce the amount of computation, thus enabling analysis on edge devices. This project constructs a cyberinfrastructure for three services: (1) understand contextual information to reduce the search space of analysis methods, (2) reduce computation by considering only necessary pixels, and (3) automate evaluation of analysis results based on the contextual information without human effort.<br/><br/>Understanding contextual information is achieved by using background segmentation, GPS-location-dependent logic, and image depth maps.  Background analysis leverages semantic segmentation and analysis over time to identify the background pixels and then generate inference rules via a background-implies-foreground relationship. If a pixel is consistently marked by the same semantic label across a long period of time, this pixel is classified as a background pixel. The background information can infer certain types of foreground objects. For example, if the background is city streets, the foreground objects can be vehicles or pedestrians; if a bison is detected, this is likely a mistake. This project processes only the foreground pixels by adding masks to the neural network layers. Masking convolution can substantially reduce the amount of computation with no loss of accuracy and no additional training is needed. Meanwhile, hierarchical neural networks can skip sections of a model based on context. For example, pixels in the sky only need to be processed by the hierarchy nodes that classify airplanes. The project provides an online service that can accept input data and analysis programs for automatic evaluation of the programs, without human created labels. The evaluation is based on the correlations of background and foreground objects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The notion of a graph is extremely general and expressive, as it can model arbitrarily complicated pairwise interactions among any collection of objects. This makes graphs important for essentially all aspects of human interests (ranging from, for example, social interactions, to science, internet search, engineering, and pure mathematics). This also makes the world of graphs immensely rich and complicated. It is therefore highly desirable to develop methodologies that could enhance one?s ability to understand and utilize graphs. This joint research project is devoted to further elucidate the geometric perspective of graphs, which provides deep and often unexpected insights on their structure. A graph induces a geometry on its nodes by defining its associated notion of distance to be the minimum number of hops along edges of the graph that is required to reach one node to another. One of the main questions that will be investigated is how the local structure of a graph, namely how it looks near each of its nodes, imposes restrictions on the behavior of its global properties. For example, if the graph does not contain short cycles (a phenomenon that is common in many cases of interest), then near each node one sees a tree. However if the graph is finite, then these local trees cannot maintain their tree-like growth indefinitely, that is, they must somehow eventually merge. It is remarkable how little is presently known about how having a local tree-like structure influences the global structure of a graph. This joint research project will tackle the abundance of longstanding mysteries about the global ramifications of being locally a tree. There is a wealth of further local-global geometric mysteries about graphs, such as fundamental questions about codes (existence and limitations thereof), which are subsets of a high-dimensional graph called the discrete cube in which all nonzero pairwise distances are large. Other issues that will be studied in this joint research project include finding algorithms to efficiently partition graphs, low-dimensional representations, representation of the graph distance as a superposition of much simpler distance functions, etc. This joint NSF-BSF project will provide an opportunity to enhance the interaction between U.S. and Israeli researchers who have been attacking such questions separately from different angles. It will address specific questions in these directions, and will also develop overarching methodologies to understand graphs through the lens of the global geometry that they induce.   <br/> <br/>The idea that geometry may provide deep and often unexpected insights in discrete mathematics has been immensely fruitful. Suffices it to mention how isoperimetric inequalities have evolved into sophisticated concepts such as expander graphs which play a fundamental role in areas ranging from group theory to theoretical computer science and many other topics in between. More specifically, this joint research project will investigate the global geometry of graphs. One of the main questions that will be investigated is to what extent a finite graph can look locally like an infinite regular tree.<br/>Such a finite graph clearly has no short cycles, i.e., it has a large girth. Also its diameter should be small. How large can the girth be? How small can the diameter be? Can a graph simultaneously have a large girth and a small diameter? To what extent can the metric on a large girth graph be approximated by a superposition of cut metrics or by a Euclidean metric? Arguably, the most important metric space for combinatorics is the discrete cube and its powers. Understanding the independence number of these graphs is a classical open question: The rate versus distance problem for binary codes. The best bounds that are presently available are nearly a half a century old. The most important codes both in theory in practice are linear codes. Strangely enough, no tighter upper bounds are known for linear codes. This joint research project will study a strengthening of Delsarte?s classical linear program that distinguishes linear from general codes. Major open questions on algorithmic graph partitioning will also be investigated in this joint research project, as well as fundamental issues in dimension reduction, spectral graph theory, and the search for a meaningful model of random metric spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Working in the Magdalena River basin, Colombia, students will learn cutting-edge field, remote sensing, and computational tools, develop critical and systems thinking, and complete team-based research projects. Students will work with instructors from University of Montana, University of Colorado, and Colombia, taking advantage of long-term research sites in the Magdalena River basin and broad expertise. The Rivers of the Andes Field Training course will recruit a diverse group of students that broadens participation in sciences, and course materials and lessons learned will be shared openly and widely. <br/><br/>River systems are under stress from climate change and growing demands for water, energy, and food. There is a strong disconnect, however, between where research and teaching about fluvial processes is concentrated, and where stresses on river systems such as new dam construction and associated impacts on humans and biodiversity are more recently evolving, such as in the Andes. Moreover, innovative and interdisciplinary approaches are needed to address challenges such as those surrounding river systems and to prepare students for the 21st century workforce. To address these challenges, we propose Rivers of the Andes Field Training (RAFT), a course to be taught in Colombia that will provide field-based training in river sciences. Course content will focus on hydrology and fluvial geomorphology, especially river mechanics, floods, and sediment regimes, and complementary content in tropical fish ecology and basin-scale, cumulative-impact and decision-support analysis. RAFT will use the Magdalena River and its tributaries as a field site to illustrate broader content about river processes and Andean rivers. The course will augment field training with classroom teaching about fluvial processes and observational, measurement and modeling approaches for understanding river processes. RAFT will provide a transformative experience for graduate student participants by combining innovative approaches and technologies with evidence-based best practices to not only advance knowledge of river sciences and associated tools, but also to promote critical and systems thinking and observational, interdisciplinary, and teamwork skills. RAFT will include international and multicultural experience, interdisciplinary teaching on cutting-edge process knowledge and tools, training in cross-scale and systems thinking, team-based projects, and practice in science communication.

It responds to continuing concerns about racial and social inequities in STEM fields that begin to emerge in the early childhood years. The overarching goal of the project is to identify cultural strengths that support early science learning opportunities among Spanish-speaking children from immigrant Latin American communities, a population that is traditionally underrepresented in STEM educational and career pursuits. Building on a growing interest in the ways stories can promote early engagement in and understanding of science, this project will investigate the role of oral and written stories as culturally relevant and potentially powerful tools for making scientific ideas and inquiry practices meaningful and accessible for young Latinx children. Findings will reveal ways that family storytelling practices can provide accessible entry points for Latinx children's early science learning, and recommend methods that parents and educators can use to foster learning about scientific practices that can, in turn, increase interest and participation in science education and fields. <br/><br/>The project will advance knowledge on the socio-cultural and familial experience of Latinx children that can contribute to their early science learning and skills. The project team will examine the oral story and reading practices of 330 Latinx families with 3- to 5-year-old children recruited from three geographic locations in the United States: New York, Chicago, and San Jose. Combining interviews and observations, the project team will investigate: (1) how conversations about science and nature occur in Latinx children's daily lives, and (2) whether and to what extent narrative and expository books, family personal narratives, and adivinanzas (riddles) engender family conversations about scientific ideas and science practices. Across- and within-site comparisons will allow the project team to consider the immediate ecology and broader factors that shape Latinx families? science-related views and practices. Although developmental science has long acknowledged that early learning is culturally situated, most research on early STEM is still informed by mainstream experiences that largely exclude the lived experiences of children from groups underrepresented in STEM, especially those who speak languages other than English. The proposed work will advance understanding of stories as cultural resources to support early science engagement and learning among Latinx children and inform the development of high quality, equitable informal and formal science educational opportunities for young children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this complex web of nature, predicting how biodiversity will change over time is challenging. Because changes in one species abundance propagate through interactions in the community to affect other species, it is often not sufficient to understand only how organisms respond directly to environmental conditions. This same challenge affects the utilization of monitoring information by conservation and restoration practitioners. Considerable time and resources are devoted to monitoring these complex changes, and it can be difficult to discern whether changes indicate a healthy self-sustaining system or one that is declining and on the verge of collapse. Other disciplines outside ecology also deal with analogous complex processes and have developed metrics and analytical frameworks to describe dynamics of multi-dimensional systems over time. In the proposed work, these metrics will be applied to long-term ecological datasets to inform how managers can utilize monitoring datasets. Datasets in the proposed synthesis will also form the foundation for graduate student seminars and exchanges to train across subdisciplines and connect theory to applied work.<br/><br/>This project seeks to develop a new perspective on the temporal dynamics of multispecies communities by highlighting, through synthesis, ways to describe how complex ecological systems respond to environmental change and how species organization within a community may cause different dynamics in the propagation of environmental change. The project focuses on several innovative metrics that can describe dynamic stability of multispecies communities, using a series of eight long-term plant community datasets. It then seeks to apply new methods that describe the organization of species interactions to connect dynamics with community organization. The last part of the project seeks to make this understanding more useable to decision-makers through collaborations with managers on analyses of long-term conservation monitoring datasets. Partnering with managers and training graduate students, the research will explore new ways to arrive at a better understanding of how to monitor and anticipate dynamic ecological responses to environmental change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there is a notably large body of rigorous research documenting that high-dosage tutoring produces large academic gains for children who have fallen behind academically, less is known about the features of effective programs needed to guide program design. Additionally, the widespread adoption of tutoring programs has been hampered by the high upfront costs of intensive individualized instructional programs. This project will therefore isolate the key features of the most effective tutoring programs and the costs associated with these programs to identify program models with the potential to deliver the greatest benefits at the lowest cost. Program features could relate to tutor characteristics, the dosage of tutoring delivered, the timing of tutoring sessions, the training and support provided to tutors, tutor-student ratios, the content of tutoring sessions, and more. The project is particularly timely given policymakers and educators are currently looking to invest in affordable strategies to support students? learning in mathematics given early evidence that Covid-19-related educational disruptions have negatively affected mathematics achievement. This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>The project will include a thorough meta-analysis of all existing studies of mathematics tutoring interventions that use quasi-experimental or experimental methods designed to isolate the causal effects of the tutoring program in question. More specifically, the research team will search for, collect, and code all studies based on the features of the intervention under examination, the size of the effects the intervention had on student outcomes, as well as information that will allow them to calculate costs for each intervention. Researchers will then pool estimates across studies to identify the average effects of mathematics tutoring on student achievement and average per-pupil costs and to examine how the effects and costs of tutoring programs vary by design and program features. Finally, the researchers will examine which features of interventions predict the largest academic gains for students and calculate cost-benefit ratios for each intervention. Meta-analytic and cost-effectiveness reviews are a critical step in developing new scientific knowledge by generating conclusions with greater precision and external validity and accounting for publication bias which can skew perceptions about the overall effectiveness of an intervention when only well-known or successful programs are highlighted in the literature. This project will provide a comprehensive review across all existing studies, ultimately allowing the research team to accurately identify those mathematics tutoring models with the greatest promise for both impact and scalability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will include the application of novel methods (calcium and triple oxygen isotopes) on stalagmites from Lake Shasta Caverns (northern California) and Titan Cave (northern Wyoming), and will provide new chronological data and novel measurements (carbonate clumped and triple oxygen isotopes) at four lake sites in the northeast Great Basin (Bear Lake, Utah/Idaho and Bonneville Basin, Utah/Nevada), and southwest Great Basin/Mojave Desert (Lake Manix and Owens Lake, California). The anticipated results of this project are past records of changes in temperature, rainfall amount and moisture source and seasonality. These new past climate records will be integrated into a regional proxy-data network used to benchmark climate model simulations of the Last Interglacial period (127 ka).<br/><br/>The paleoclimate modeling intercomparison (PMIP4) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) efforts of the climate modeling community include Tier 1 LIG (127ka) simulations as a benchmarking target for models with similar CO2 levels, different orbital configuration, unchanged topography and higher sea level. The validation of hydroclimate-relevant variables at a regional scale using climate models requires robustly dated and spatially distributed paleoclimate observations in order to place the LIG water cycle in the western U.S. in the context of geologic and future climate change. Yet, few quantitative estimates of paleoclimate exist for this interval, which offers geochronologic challenges too as it is beyond the limit of radiocarbon age control. This project seeks to improve our understanding of LIG climate in the western U.S. by providing: 1) new observations from speleothem records, 2) new U-Th dating of existing lake cores, and 3) the application of novel semi-quantitative proxies for temperature, precipitation and humidity to speleothems and lake sediments. Through the development of new high-resolution proxy time-series from speleothems and lake sediments, we will provide new insight into the behavior of the North American Monsoon during a past warm period and reconstruct hydroclimatic response to abrupt climatic events during the penultimate deglaciation (Termination II) and Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS5). The research uses existing lake cores recovered and archived by previous NSF- and USGS-funded continental drilling projects, and recently collected speleothems known to span much of MIS5 and the LIG.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include quantifying regional hydroclimate changes during past warm periods and benchmarking of climate model simulations for the last interglacial. Other Broader Impacts include translating the project research outcomes via a workshop (paleo to policy) convening water resource managers, government agencies (e.g., USGS), climate and weather risk assessment and projection companies and early career paleoclimate researchers from across the U.S. This workshop will emphasize on the information that terrestrial past climate records (lake sediments, tree rings, speleothems) can provide in terms of hydroclimate data beyond the instrumental records needed by policy makers to assess climate variability and extreme events such as drought and floods. The researchers will produce a white paper, policy briefs for water resource managers and a presentation at an education and outreach session at a scientific meeting (American Geophysical Union). The project will provide scientific training, mentorship and professional development for two graduate students and one postdoctoral researcher. Through joint field trips and collaborations, these students and postdoc will have opportunities to develop interdisciplinary expertise in climate archives, novel proxy systems, geochronology and model-proxy comparison. In addition, the researchers will recruit undergraduate students to complete summer internships related to the project. The undergraduate students will be recruited through (1) the Earth Horizons program and partnership between Vanderbilt University and Tennessee State University, a Historically Black University (HBCU); (2) the Leadership Alliance program at Brown University funded through NSF-REU-EPSCOR. The undergraduate students will be encouraged to develop their research into presentations at regional, national and international scientific meetings (e.g., AGU, GSA).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this view of intelligence is shifting. Increasingly, researchers recognize that merely interacting with the environment requires animals to solve very complex problems. Many of these problems turn out to be more challenging to solve than what is classically defined as intelligent behavior. For example, consider an insect walking across uneven, unpredictable terrain. Coordinating the movement of six legs is a challenging problem. Interacting with the environment is difficult because the animal does not have complete knowledge about its body or the terrain. Nor does it have much time to gather information. This lack of information is common when animals interact with the world. Currently, we do not have a good idea of how animals deal with this lack of knowledge. Bats are ideal animals in which to study this problem. Their sonar system provides them only with limited information about their surroundings. Despite this, they perform astoundingly coordinated and intelligent behavior. The current project investigates strategies echolocating bats use to overcome the lack of sensory information. The aim is to use robots to model several bat behaviors under conditions where the lack of sensory information is the most severe, for example, during the emergence from caves. Using robots instead of computer simulations allows mimicking the sonar signals received by bats faithfully. By examining strategies bats can use to deal with informational deficiencies, the project aims at understanding how animals more generally can overcome this problem.<br/><br/><br/>Animal intelligence is often typified by abilities such as learning, problem-solving, tool use, and other facets of higher-order cognition. However, more recent views on animal intelligence emphasize the ability to adjust behavior to the moment-to-moment contingencies arising in interaction with the physical environment. Coping with the dynamic, unpredictable world is challenging. Most importantly, because action and perception have to proceed in the face of substantial informational deficiency. While acting, animals do not have complete knowledge about the world or their bodies. This project proposes and tests strategies for dealing with informational constraints by building bio-robotic models of bat sonar behavior, allowing for veracious mimicking of sonar signals. In particular, it is proposed that direct mapping of task-specific sensory input to action is a fundamental principle for dealing with informational constraints. Echolocating bats are ideal for understanding animal intelligence under informational constraints because their sonar system only provides limited information about the environment. Nevertheless, echolocating bats perform astounding intelligent behavior in interaction with complex environments. Understanding principles for intelligent sensorimotor control might help to understand the so-called higher cognitive functions in animals. These are not discontinuous with sensorimotor behavior. Indeed, understanding the fundamental principles of animal intelligence (and potentially human intelligence) may require learning about their sensorimotor control origins. As a result, investigating the principles supporting vertebrate sensorimotor intelligence might help explain functions more classically associated with intelligence (e.g., tool use and planning). As such, this proposal aims at contributing to a deeper understanding of animal intelligence and cognition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is accomplished by colliding particles like protons together at high energies, producing many particles which are then measured by experimental detectors. To interpret the data, detailed simulations of particle collisions are needed. Monte Carlo event generators provide the simulations and are at the core of particle physics discoveries, such as the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012, forming a keystone of the cyberinfrastructure for particle physics. This project addresses a bottle-neck in Monte Carlo event generators ? how quarks are bound together inside protons and other composite particles through the process of hadronization. Hadronization models are improved by this project, including the speed of simulating the process of hadronization, fulfilling a critical step for understanding the scientific impact of upcoming large-scale particle, neutrino, and nuclear physics projects. <br/><br/>Event generators simulate particle collisions in three steps: a high energy collision at the small distances, evolution of the event into a large distance (low energy) configuration, and finally a hadronization into observable particles. The hadronization step is particularly challenging, because it cannot be directly calculated from first principles. Since hundreds of particles must be produced for each particle collision, algorithmic efficiency is necessary and requires innovative approaches. This project is applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques to hadronization in order to: connect to existing models of hadronization, understand the underlying description of data by current event generators augmented with ML, and provide a fast and accurate ML based simulation of hadronization. As part of the project, a platform is being built where user submitted modules, such as this ML hadronization module, can be incorporated in the most widely used event generator in the particle physics community, Pythia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is considered as one of the promising building blocks for next generation microelectronic technologies. Compared with existing computing devices, the ones based on spin wave can have lower power consumption, higher speed and are compatible with parallel operations. In order to realize computing devices based on spin wave, some bottlenecks need to be overcome. Particularly, one has to control the flow of spin wave inside solid materials. This project utilizes a novel mechanism to control the spin wave flow, which is intrinsically compact and consumes little energy. The fundamental knowledge achieved in this project has direct microelectronic applications and can lead to new device structures for information storage and computing. The research and education efforts ensure students at different levels benefit from the research and get trained to master cross-disciplinary techniques used in this project. The project not only educates and trains the next generation scientists and engineers but also assists to place them in microelectronic industry after graduation. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The study on the interactions between spin current and the dynamics of nanoscale magnetic structures has been a very active research area within spintronics. The non-uniform magnetic textures-induced magnetoresistance and the spin current-caused magnetic switching have both led to important industrial applications. However, existing research mostly employ conduction electrons to carry spin current. The other useful way of transferring spin angular momentum within solid state materials, i.e., to use spin wave, has remained largely unstudied experimentally, despite the theoretical prediction on the rich physics that can be caused by the interactions between spin wave and magnetic structures. This project focuses on quantitatively studying the influence of magnetic textures on the transport of magnon spin current, as well as the magnonic spin torque induced magnetic switching.  Particularly, the project aims to achieve quantitative understanding between spin wave transport and the internal structures of domain wall as well as topological magnetic textures. The project enhances people?s understanding on the spin current transport enabled by magnons and results in new ways of controlling magnetic ordering in solids. This project has applications in microelectronic industry on making better interconnections and leads to new device schemes for information storage and computing. Integrated research and education efforts are established through the project so that students at K12, undergraduate and graduate levels benefit from the research, who are trained to master cross-disciplinary techniques used in this project, including material synthesis and characterization, nanoscale device fabrication and microwave circuit design and measurement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team will conduct an experimental and computational study of hydrogen mobility and diffusion across aluminum oxide surfaces to understand the important factors in controlling the speed of H- and D- atom transport.  This will include developing methods to control the spacing between catalytic H2/D2 activation sites and H/D reaction sites on the oxide surface.  The team will then screen spinel oxides, a class of transition doped aluminum oxide materials with wide ranging electronic properties, for their H/D- atom transport properties using several computational and machine-learning techniques.  Promising candidate oxides will be synthesized and their H mobility fully evaluated and compared to predictions to begin developing the IKR.  Both principal investigators will recruit graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups.

Further development of this technique may also lead to new design strategies for selective hydrogenation catalysts. To establish this new tool the team will use density functional theory calculations combined with machine-learning techniques to screen for spinel oxides with suitable electronic structure. Promising candidates will be synthesized and their H mobility evaluated through careful kinetic measurements and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.

Due to its flexibility in capturing system randomness, simulation has been a popular tool to support decision-making problems that arise in manufacturing, healthcare, defense, finance, and other domains. However, simulation analysis is subject to ?model risk? of drawing an incorrect statistical inference due to discrepancy between the real system and the simulation model. Failure to account for such risk may lead to poor quality decisions made on the basis of these models. This research focuses on ?input model risk? that arises when the probability distribution functions driving randomness in a simulation model are estimated based on the available data. The project will study methods to quantify, reduce, and ensure robust decisions under input model risk. In particular, a new robust decision-making framework will be studied to balance a practical user input on acceptable suboptimality and robustness to the statistical error in the simulation model. The education mission of this grant is to train current and next-generation STEM workforce to make model risk a central focus of simulation analysis and equip them with computational tools to employ. <br/><br/>This research will enable input model risk quantification for complex simulated systems that are here-to-fore practically infeasible due to computationally complexity. A minimum-cost simulation experiment design will be obtained by applying the likelihood ratio method and solving a bilevel optimization problem. Moreover, a Gaussian process (GP) metamodel will be created to predict the simulation output mean as a function of both parametric and nonparametric input models. This GP metamodel will serve as a vehicle to design a comprehensive framework for all three steps of the robust simulation analysis life cycle: (1) risk quantification, (2) robust optimization, and (3) risk reduction. The concept of ?practically robust? optimality will be newly defined by accounting for the user-specified practical optimality gap of interest. This framework will reduce conservatism of existing methods while achieving the level of robustness the user desires. To find a practically robust optimum, an efficient simulation optimization algorithm, which sequentially allocates simulation effort guided by GP inference, will be created. Finally, an actionable guidance to reduce input model risk will be provided by optimizing the data collection plan to attain a stronger statistical performance guarantee for the practically robust optimum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, it is designed to advance understanding about how students' sense of belonging develops in undergraduate learning experiences outside of the traditional classroom. The project will focus on residential undergraduate field courses, a pivotal learning experience in STEM disciplines such as ecology, geology, and geography. A sense of belonging plays an important role in students' mental health and well-being, academic achievement and motivation, and institution-level retention.  It is also pivotal for the persistence of students from communities that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The overarching goal of the project is to build the capacity of geosciences and biology faculty to support the development of students' sense of belonging.  In this way, it can help to improve the inclusivity of courses that are a critical pathway for thousands of undergraduate students in field-based STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This project has the potential for broad reach and impact on student engagement and learning in multiple STEM disciplines and is likely to have a positive impact on the inclusivity of undergraduate field education.  It may be especially important for students from communities that have been historically excluded from field-based STEM disciplines, whose persistence is strongly linked to sense of belonging in the scientific community. The project focuses on advancing understanding about how students' sense of belonging develops in residential field experiences and builds capacity for faculty from geosciences and biology to support the growth of students' sense of belonging. The following objectives will guide the project study: 1) Identify factors that contribute to and hinder the development of students' sense of belonging during residential geosciences and biology undergraduate field courses; 2) Characterize the design and implementation of geosciences and biology undergraduate field courses, specifically what practices faculty are using and what challenges and needs exist for the development of students' sense of belonging during undergraduate field courses; 3) Create  an empirically-based framework of how students' sense of belonging develops during residential  undergraduate field courses; 4) Facilitate a Community of Practice that uses and contributes to promising practices for the design and assessment of inclusive field courses that support the development of students' sense of belonging; and 5) Articulate a suite of promising practices that have the potential to promote the development of students' sense of belonging during a range of formats of undergraduate field courses and for students from different backgrounds. Using innovative and robust mixed methods research approaches, this work will contribute to the wider body of evidence-based, student-centered practices in undergraduate STEM education. The work has the potential to provide a deep and impactful contribution to the fields of discipline-based education research (particularly in geosciences and biology), higher education, education and social psychology, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Crowd logistics is a term that describes crowdsourced transport and delivery of goods and freight.  Senders source cost-effective logistics services from individual carriers via an online platform, which is controlled by a digital management system.  To be successful, a platform must rapidly scale up its sender and carrier networks.  If there are too few participants, senders and recipients will be dissatisfied by unfilled service requests, carriers will have insufficient opportunities, and the initiative will fail.  This award supports a fundamental understanding of crowd logistics platform design for robust network growth and performance by attracting and retaining participants having a variety of economic and social motivations.  The knowledge gained from this research will facilitate the use of crowd logistics for resilient food distribution in the face of large-scale disruptions, such as the COVID-19 emergency.  The educational plan seeks to implement participatory modeling activities that will improve STEM students? capacity for systems thinking, which is critical in the design and analysis of complex logistics systems.  <br/><br/>This research will produce a novel agent-based modeling approach to systematically explore the impacts of a crowd logistics platform?s design on its ability to quickly achieve a critical mass of participants.  This approach will model the degree of control that a platform management system assumes over participants? digital exchanges.  At one end of the spectrum is a platform characterized by centralized control, full automation, and algorithmic management; at the other end is a platform with decentralized control and community-driven exchanges.  Existing research on crowdsourcing platform design suggests that the degree of centralization of control impacts platform growth over time. However, understanding and predicting network effects that will lead to long-term platform growth is challenging, because the feedback loop perpetuated by participant decisions and interactions yields complex and dynamic system behavior. This research will address this challenge by representing carriers and senders as autonomous, heterogeneous, and adaptive agents, whose decisions to participate in a crowd logistics platform impact the participation of other agents over time.  Participatory modeling sessions with crowd logistics practitioners will be leveraged for model validation, to ensure that agent behaviors correspond to those of their real-world counterparts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Are these fluxes hydrothermal or benthic in origin? Are dissolved metals supplied by the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge to the abyssal Southern Ocean? 3) How do micronutrient metal uptake stoichiometries change across gradients of primary production, community composition, and nutrient limitation from the gyre to ACC waters?

Montgomery County Community College (MCCC) is the lead institution in the Northeast Biomanufacturing Center and Collaborative.  It has an extensive track record in developing and disseminating curriculum for biopharmaceutical bioprocessing technician education. In this project, MCCC will work with local industry partners to determine skills and competencies needed in the advanced therapy technical workforce, develop curriculum in cell and gene therapy manufacturing, and facilitate adoption of the curriculum at local two-year colleges. The new curriculum will provide students with a strong foundation in the skills and knowledge for developing, manufacturing, and testing these advanced therapies, as well as hands-on experience with industry-relevant bioprocessing equipment.<br/><br/>The project will assess the competencies, skills, and curriculum needs of local biotechnology programs at two-year institutions, provide mentorship for enhancing or building new courses where needed, provide educators with professional development relevant to the new curriculum, and connect them to local industry. Students from communities that are underrepresented in the biomanufacturing sector, including students of color and/or first-generation college students, will have increased access to successful bioprocessing careers, as the project builds a pipeline from high school to community college to the advanced therapy workforce. Project aims include: (1) improving student education and training by developing and disseminating a local industry-endorsed advanced therapy curriculum; (2) promoting and facilitating adoption of new curriculum at local community colleges through mentorship, industry engagement, and professional development; and (3) increasing awareness of the biomedical/bioprocessing career path among high school students, with emphasis on inclusion of underrepresented populations.

It has both scientific and societal benefits in addition to integrating research and education. PhDs in psychology and neuroscience are awarded to individuals from underrepresented minority (URM) groups ? racial and ethnic minorities, low-income, and first-generation college students ? in proportions far lower than is their representation in the overall population. The Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP) at the University of Wisconsin?Madison (UW) seeks to address this problem by adopting a core motivating premise of the REU mechanism, which is that Research experience is one of the most effective avenues for attracting students to and retaining them in science and engineering, and for preparing them for careers in these fields. Indeed, two-thirds of PREP?s 74 alumni from years 2011-2020, all from URM groups, are currently working as postdoctoral researchers, matriculating in a graduate program in a STEM discipline, engaged in postbac research activities in preparation for applying to graduate school, or finishing up their undergraduate studies in a STEM field of study. PREP is held for 10 weeks each the summer, during which students engage in immersive mentored research coupled with hands-on classroom training in data science, and professional development. Each PREP student carries out their research project in a laboratory in, or affiliated with, the Department of Psychology. They receive mentorship from the Principal Investigator of their lab, and day-to-day supervision from a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow in that lab. Weekly data science workshops are led by faculty and trainees of the UW?s NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program that focuses on learning, understanding, cognition, intelligence, and data-science (LUCID). Weekly professional development sessions are led by a rotating set of faculty from the Department of Psychology.<br/>  <br/>PREP?s  focus is on integrating principles and methods of data science into the study of psychology and neuroscience. This was developed as a result of polling faculty at the UW about What attributes do you seek when you are recruiting graduate students for your own lab? A response that was common across every faculty member polled was prior experience with technical skills. The specifics varied from lab to lab, but facility with programming, such as in MATLAB, python, and/or the R environment, was the most frequently listed desideratum. More broadly, a trend in almost all domains of psychology and neuroscience is an increased emphasis on data science. In some domains it?s data mining and meta analysis. In some, it?s large-scale data collection, such as internet-based studies with Amazon?s Mechanical Turk. In neuroscience, it?s the increasing appreciation that individual neural data sets can, in-and-of themselves, constitute a kind of ?big data? to which methods from machine learning and other branches of engineering are increasingly being applied. PREP?s organizational structure reflects close ties between the PREP REU and the LUCID NRT. Administratively, the PI/Director of PREP, Bradley Postle, who has held this role since 2011, is joined by Co-I, Timothy Rogers, a colleague of Postle in the Dept. of Psychology who is also the PI/Director of LUCID. A Program Coordinator assists the Director with admissions during the Spring semester, management of logistics and student life while participants travel to and live in Madison for the residency portion of the REU, and tracking program alumni. The Program Coordinator also works closely with the Co-I to organize the weekly data science workshops. The program?s mentoring organizational structure pairs each PREP student with three mentors: a faculty mentor, who is a tenured/tenure-track/or PI-status faculty member at the Department of Psychology or at one of LUCID?s other core departments (Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Educational Psychology); a research mentor, who is the graduate student or postdoctoral fellow who is responsible for day-to-day research mentoring of the PREP student; and an alumni mentor, an alumna/us of PREP.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the name suggests, this research area sits at the interface of two fields: arithmetic (the study of whole numbers and fractions); and geometry (the study of curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional shapes). These distinct areas are brought together through the study of solutions to polynomial equations, that is, the study of varieties. A guiding philosophy of arithmetic geometry is that ""geometry controls arithmetic,"" in other words, that the geometric properties of a variety (those that can be studied in terms of the complex numbers) influence the arithmetic behavior of the variety. The broad goals of this project are to better understand the influence of geometry on two arithmetic properties: rationality over the ground field, and the existence of isolated points. The research involves several projects for students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.<br/><br/>The project concerns a systematic study of an arithmetic measure of the failure of k-rationality, focusing on geometrically rational threefolds that have a conic bundle structure or that have a fibration into high degree del Pezzo surfaces. These two types of varieties together cover a large swath of all geometrically rational threefolds. In another direction, the project aims to gather more information on isolated points on curves. The aims in this direction are twofold: 1) determine whether the Bombieri-Lang conjecture and the torsion conjecture imply that the number of isolated points on a curve is bounded depending solely on its genus, and 2) compute all isolated points on a collection of modular curves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will lead to advances in deep underground directional drilling systems impacting national strategic areas including energy, the environment and outer space exploration. In energy, it will enable automated directional drilling for enhanced geothermal energy systems and unconventional natural gas production. This will significantly reduce the cost of energy production of renewables and clean energy, and more importantly, can reduce environmental impact and enhance production safety. In environmental research, the project will address a critical technical barrier to accessing ancient ice cores in the South Pole, to evaluate large-scale climate patterns and predict future climate changes such as the evolution of global warming. In outer space exploration, it will build the fundamental foundation to control a drilling robot to reach potential signs of microbial life and water resources on Mars, to fulfill the ultimate mission of the Mars exploration. Directional drilling control in these applications is challenging, because potentially undesirable working conditions due to vibrations and wellbore formation interaction in the deep underground are difficult to avoid. Existing studies on the directional drilling control cannot ensure avoiding these undesired operating conditions. The geological challenge and the need for a more environment-friendly production process together urge safer, deeper, more accurate and reliable drilling process. Along with the research, this project will encourage controls engineering among underrepresented student groups through new curriculum development, teacher education, remote lab facilities development and outreach activities.<br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to create a new framework of controlling a large-scale system with a long, curved string-like geometry to avoid undesired operating conditions for deep underground exploration. The outcome includes a novel control-oriented model by leveraging the unique string geometry, and a new method for state-barrier avoidance control that can address complex barriers. For modeling, a new hybrid scheme that can integrate an analytical approach with a numerical solution is researched , and can achieve both computation-efficiency and high fidelity to enable control design. For control, a novel method that resolves the barrier avoidance in a cascade fashion is researched. This method enables addressing state barriers with complex shape in a systematic way for the first time, and can broaden the range of applications of state-barrier avoidance control to more types of barriers and systems (especially with high order dynamics).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many trace metals, which are by definition present in very low amounts, are essential for life and thus considered nutrients for phytoplankton growth. Other elements can be useful for tracing other ocean processes, and some (such as lead) are important because they are pollutants. This project will address three main objectives: 1) to measure the dissolved concentrations and size partitioning of micronutrients iron, manganese, zinc, copper, cadmium, nickel, and pollutant lead in seawater from Tahiti towards Antarctica and then back northeast to South America; 2) to analyze the isotope ratios - the relative abundance of different forms of the same chemical element - of iron, zinc, cadmium, nickel, and copper in seawater, suspended particles, aerosols, and porewaters from this section, as isotopes provide diagnostic insights into sources, sinks, and metal transformations beyond what is provided by concentration measurements alone; and 3) to use ocean models to constrain the rates of ocean processes and effects of ocean circulation on trace metal and isotope distributions. This project spans three US labs, and four graduate students and several undergraduate students will participate. It will also provide ultrafiltered samples and data to several other collaborating groups as a service.<br/><br/><br/>The U.S. GEOTRACES GP17-OCE expedition, planned for late 2021 or 2022, aims to determine the distribution of trace elements and isotopes along a transect spanning regions of global importance to nutrient and carbon cycling, crossing the South Pacific Gyre, the iron-limited waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, Pacific Deep Waters with hydrothermal inputs, and waters near the Chilean margin. The South Pacific Gyre and Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean are climate-critical regions for the transfer of heat, carbon, and nutrients within the global ocean, and they are a region where phytoplankton growth is typically limited by low concentrations of iron (Fe) in the surface ocean. The investigators will use a variety of analytical approaches, along with analyses made by other project collaborators, to address four major objectives related to dissolved micronutrient biogeochemistry in this region: 1) What are the relative fluxes of dissolved metals from dust, sediments, and Antarctic continental inputs to surface waters of the South Pacific gyre and ACC waters? 2) What fluxes of trace metals, especially Fe, are delivered by Pacific Deep Water to the Southern Ocean for upwelling to the surface waters? Are these fluxes hydrothermal or benthic in origin? Are dissolved metals supplied by the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge to the abyssal Southern Ocean? 3) How do micronutrient metal uptake stoichiometries change across gradients of primary production, community composition, and nutrient limitation from the gyre to ACC waters? How are these affected by metal speciation? 4) How do pre-formed biological signatures in surface waters, combined with regeneration and scavenging along the transport path, influence the regional and global distribution of TEIs?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates the dynamics of soft material interfaces guided by the hypothesis that sliding surfaces in nature reduce friction through a delicate balance of fracturing and rapidly re-healing crosslinks between macromolecules in aqueous solutions.

It draws on classroom teacher knowledge while employing the rigorous statistical methods used in standardized assessment creation and validation. The content focus is on the disciplinary core ideas for grades 6-8 physical science in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teachers now spend an estimate 20% of their time in assessment, yet have relatively few tools to draw upon when creating them. Over time, they learn to adapt items from available curriculum materials and textbooks. On the other hand, standardized assessment developers have the benefit of expert item writers, long development cycles, a large and diverse student population, and sophisticated psychometric tools. This project combines these two approaches, drawing upon teachers to contribute their best items, then immediately piloting them using crowdsourced subjects. Psychometric analysis generates measures of item quality and then ?recycles? items to participating teachers for improvement. In this way, a large test item bank will be constructed utilizing teacher input with each item possessing: appropriate reading levels, NGSS alignment, scientific accuracy, appropriate difficulty, high statistical discrimination, and negligible difference by gender, race, or ethnicity. Involvement in this project has potential benefits for teachers lacking formal training in assessment, familiarizing participants with the NGSS, and with the elements of high-quality test development.<br/><br/>The project will gauge the merits of a novel collaborative system for the development and validation of high-quality test items and assessment instruments. It will measure the degree to which teachers can generate effective items and improve existing items exhibiting problematic issues when given the guidance of rigorous psychometric measures that estimate item quality. It will build on earlier research showing that an adult, crowd-sourced sample works well as an initial proxy for grade 6-8 science students, allowing for extremely rapid feedback on item quality (often overnight), with item response theory computation used to establish item difficulty, item discrimination, guessing levels, and differential item functioning (gender and racial/ethnicity bias). In addition, computed measures of misconception strength, scientific correctness, reading level, and match to the NGSS will help to guide revision by teachers. Use of Bayesian futility analysis will ?triage? items, minimizing costly testing of items when deemed unlikely to meet item quality criteria, lowering costs. Field testing with a large sample of grade 6-8 students will provide a final check on item quality. Items will be developed much more inexpensively than by methods used for standardized test development. Two pairs (public-release and secure for chemistry and physics) of assessment instruments will be constructed and be freely available to science teachers for classroom use and by education researchers and curriculum developers. A system that provides quick feedback on item quality could potentially transform university instruction and professional development opportunities in assessment. While starting with selected response (multiple-choice) items, the project will be able to implement a larger variety of formats in the future, incorporating automated approaches as they become available.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Quantification of uncertainty in these simulations is crucial to increased clinical adoption but has previously been largely disregarded due to its excessive computational cost and complexity. To address these challenges, the project leverages a new class of multi-fidelity Monte Carlo estimators for direct and inverse problems, designed to mitigate computational complexity through the solution of a large number of inexpensive low-fidelity surrogates. It demonstrates the proposed approach in full-scale clinical problems including multiple uncertainty sources at a reasonable computational budget. The project?s main objective is to create an end-to-end advanced cyberinfrastructure ecosystem for uncertainty quantification (direct problem) and parameter estimation (inverse problem) in cardiovascular models incorporating realistic sources of uncertainty, able to leverage arbitrary low-fidelity models through advanced Monte Carlo estimators, while drastically reducing computational cost and complexity. The project?s interdisciplinary team is synergizing computational modeling, cardiovascular physiology, UQ and open-source software towards making UQ tractable in full-scale 3D cardiovascular simulations, leveraging multi-fidelity estimators for the solution of both direct and inverse problems. The project will produce seamless cyberinfrastructure linking two well-regarded open-source packages, Dakota and SimVascular, with sizable user communities.<br/><br/>The project is creating new cyberinfrastructure ecosystems for large-scale UQ tasks.

However, their computational study has been limited by the inherent complexity of the simulations required. In particular, little is known about heat transfer in particulate flows. The present project addresses a canonical problem in this broad class, namely the effect of suspended particles on buoyant Rayleigh-Bénard thermal convection, the flow in a fluid layer heated from below and cooled from above. The particle-free version of this problem has been the subject of extensive studies due to its centrality in many branches of physics and engineering, but the effect of particles has barely been scratched. The work proposed here seeks to answer fundamental questions by identifying the significant flow regimes in particulate natural convection and quantifying the heat transfer modifications that particles introduce. This research will influence turbulence and heat transfer models used in common industrial or geophysical simulations, including those of the atmosphere, the oceans, the earth core and climate. It also has the potential to help the development of renewal energy sources, such as those based on solar collectors and hydrogen production. <br/><br/>To advance our knowledge of particulate heat transfer, the proposed work will make use of models of increasing realism and complexity. A simplified linear analysis of Rayleigh-Bénard stability will provide an orientation on the effect of basic control parameters such as the particle-to-fluid density and heat capacity ratios, the fluid Prandtl number, and the mass and thermal loading. The point-particle model will be used to elucidate the regions of parameter space where heat transfer can be expected to be substantially modified in the turbulent regime. The culmination of the project consists in fully resolved particulate simulations using the numerical method Physalis, implemented in a highly-optimized multi-GPU code, which is able to resolve flows with many thousands of suspended particles. In this way the particle-fluid momentum and heat exchanges can be calculated from first principles avoiding the ad hoc parametrization necessary with the point-particle model. These simulations will be focused on situations of particular interest uncovered by the simplified models and will permit a much more detailed and deeper understanding of the physics involved in effects such as heat transfer enhancement and particle clustering, among others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to reconstruct variations in the spatial and seasonal distribution of precipitation in the western U.S. during the LIG during which global temperature are comparable to low-end 21st century projections. The project will include the application of novel methods (calcium and triple oxygen isotopes) on stalagmites from Lake Shasta Caverns (northern California) and Titan Cave (northern Wyoming), and will provide new chronological data and novel measurements (carbonate clumped and triple oxygen isotopes) at four lake sites in the northeast Great Basin (Bear Lake, Utah/Idaho and Bonneville Basin, Utah/Nevada), and southwest Great Basin/Mojave Desert (Lake Manix and Owens Lake, California). The anticipated results of this project are past records of changes in temperature, rainfall amount and moisture source and seasonality. These new past climate records will be integrated into a regional proxy-data network used to benchmark climate model simulations of the Last Interglacial period (127 ka).<br/><br/>The paleoclimate modeling intercomparison (PMIP4) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) efforts of the climate modeling community include Tier 1 LIG (127ka) simulations as a benchmarking target for models with similar CO2 levels, different orbital configuration, unchanged topography and higher sea level. The validation of hydroclimate-relevant variables at a regional scale using climate models requires robustly dated and spatially distributed paleoclimate observations in order to place the LIG water cycle in the western U.S. in the context of geologic and future climate change. Yet, few quantitative estimates of paleoclimate exist for this interval, which offers geochronologic challenges too as it is beyond the limit of radiocarbon age control. This project seeks to improve our understanding of LIG climate in the western U.S. by providing: 1) new observations from speleothem records, 2) new U-Th dating of existing lake cores, and 3) the application of novel semi-quantitative proxies for temperature, precipitation and humidity to speleothems and lake sediments. Through the development of new high-resolution proxy time-series from speleothems and lake sediments, we will provide new insight into the behavior of the North American Monsoon during a past warm period and reconstruct hydroclimatic response to abrupt climatic events during the penultimate deglaciation (Termination II) and Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS5). The research uses existing lake cores recovered and archived by previous NSF- and USGS-funded continental drilling projects, and recently collected speleothems known to span much of MIS5 and the LIG.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include quantifying regional hydroclimate changes during past warm periods and benchmarking of climate model simulations for the last interglacial. Other Broader Impacts include translating the project research outcomes via a workshop (paleo to policy) convening water resource managers, government agencies (e.g., USGS), climate and weather risk assessment and projection companies and early career paleoclimate researchers from across the U.S. This workshop will emphasize on the information that terrestrial past climate records (lake sediments, tree rings, speleothems) can provide in terms of hydroclimate data beyond the instrumental records needed by policy makers to assess climate variability and extreme events such as drought and floods. The researchers will produce a white paper, policy briefs for water resource managers and a presentation at an education and outreach session at a scientific meeting (American Geophysical Union). The project will provide scientific training, mentorship and professional development for two graduate students and one postdoctoral researcher. Through joint field trips and collaborations, these students and postdoc will have opportunities to develop interdisciplinary expertise in climate archives, novel proxy systems, geochronology and model-proxy comparison. In addition, the researchers will recruit undergraduate students to complete summer internships related to the project. The undergraduate students will be recruited through (1) the Earth Horizons program and partnership between Vanderbilt University and Tennessee State University, a Historically Black University (HBCU); (2) the Leadership Alliance program at Brown University funded through NSF-REU-EPSCOR. The undergraduate students will be encouraged to develop their research into presentations at regional, national and international scientific meetings (e.g., AGU, GSA).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analyzing the vast amount of visual data is a challenge. Existing computer vision methods require fast computers that are beyond the computational capabilities of many edge devices. This project aims to improve the efficiency of computer vision methods so that they can run on battery-powered edge devices. Based on the visual data and complementary metadata (e.g., geographical location, local time), the project first extracts contextual information (such as a city street is expected to be busy at rush hour). The contextual information can help assist determine whether analysis results are correct. For example, a wild animal is not expected on a city street. Moreover, contextual information can improve efficiency.  Only certain pixels need to be analyzed (pixels on the road are useful for detecting cars, while pixels in the sky are not) and this can significantly reduce the amount of computation, thus enabling analysis on edge devices. This project constructs a cyberinfrastructure for three services: (1) understand contextual information to reduce the search space of analysis methods, (2) reduce computation by considering only necessary pixels, and (3) automate evaluation of analysis results based on the contextual information without human effort.<br/><br/>Understanding contextual information is achieved by using background segmentation, GPS-location-dependent logic, and image depth maps.  Background analysis leverages semantic segmentation and analysis over time to identify the background pixels and then generate inference rules via a background-implies-foreground relationship. If a pixel is consistently marked by the same semantic label across a long period of time, this pixel is classified as a background pixel. The background information can infer certain types of foreground objects. For example, if the background is city streets, the foreground objects can be vehicles or pedestrians; if a bison is detected, this is likely a mistake. This project processes only the foreground pixels by adding masks to the neural network layers. Masking convolution can substantially reduce the amount of computation with no loss of accuracy and no additional training is needed. Meanwhile, hierarchical neural networks can skip sections of a model based on context. For example, pixels in the sky only need to be processed by the hierarchy nodes that classify airplanes.

One of the most famous distance questions is called the Erdös distinct distance problem, which asks for the least number of distinct distances generated by a given set of points. Another example is the unit distance problem, concerning the maximum number of times that a fixed distance can occur among a given set of points. These questions have motivated development of tools and ideas that have wide applications in disciplines beyond mathematics, such as computer sciences, physics, and engineering. Fourier restriction concerns the Fourier transform, which decomposes a function into pieces with different frequencies of oscillation. Fourier restriction studies a fundamental question about Fourier transform: the relation between the size of a function and the geometry of its Fourier transform. This relation has important applications in partial differential equations, number theory, and other areas. This research project aims to further the understanding of the interplay between distance questions and Fourier restriction, as well as to develop modern tools with applications in various areas of mathematics, including harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and partial differential equations.<br/><br/>One of the main directions in the project is driven by Falconer's conjecture, a continuous analogue of the distinct distance problem. It is conjectured that the distance set of a compact set E must have positive measure if the Hausdorff dimension of E exceeds a certain threshold. Recent results towards resolving the conjecture were obtained via new ideas from Fourier restriction theory: incidence geometry and geometric measure theory. This project will continue investigation of these approaches and apply them to other related distance questions such as general geometric configurations, multiparameter distances, and projections of fractal measures. The work aims to further the study of weighted Fourier restriction estimates and decoupling and to apply them to distance questions. The project is expected to reveal deeper connections between the discrete and continuous setting. An investigation of Fourier restriction for the cone in high dimensions will be continued using algebraic tools in connection with polynomial methods. In addition, the project will explore further applications of Fourier restriction in dispersive partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One enduring question in the interpretation of quantum mechanics is: just what do these probabilities signify? Many believe quantum probabilities represent something objective, such as frequencies of measurement outcomes in repeated trials. Others suggest a perhaps more radical view that quantum probabilities only represent a person?s subjective personal beliefs. On this subjective view, different people making predictions with quantum mechanics might even reasonably disagree about the probabilities of experimental outcomes.  These objective and subjective interpretations of quantum probability present starkly different philosophical viewpoints. And understanding quantum probabilities is not only important for making sense of the theory itself; it also has implications for the fields of quantum information and quantum computing, which aim to use quantum theory to develop new technologies. The goal of this project is to investigate the status of quantum probability by developing a view that does not require quantum probabilities to be only objective or only subjective, but instead allows for both possibilities. The project will analyze the relationships among objective and subjective probabilities in quantum mechanics to yield important insights about how they both figure into the nature of physical probability.<br/><br/>The current project approaches the interpretation of quantum probability in a novel way by separating questions about probability from other controversial topics in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The question of whether probabilities are objective frequencies or subjective beliefs has been addressed in existing work by tying an answer to more contentious views about the status of measurements in quantum theory. For example, some investigators reach an understanding of probability based on a view of quantum measurement that implies the existence of a ""multiverse"" of many worlds. This project will develop methods for analyzing the relationship between objective and subjective probabilities, methods which do not depend on such highly debated issues. As such, the project aims to make a lasting impact by establishing tools for understanding quantum probability that will apply, regardless of the ultimate interpretation of quantum mechanics. The project will thus lay the foundation for further research and understanding, which will be aided by disseminating the developed methods in a workshop to train early career interdisciplinary researchers, as well as public lectures to engage the broader community in these deep questions about fundamental physics and the nature of probability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Luckily, our motor systems usually operate seamlessly in concert with our perceptual and cognitive processes. Despite how they work together in the real world, these aspects of behavior have been largely studied separately in the laboratory. While that approach allows scientific rigor and has provided significant insights into each subsystem, it says little about their interaction, which may be fundamental to understanding human behavior. A better understanding of how the temporal aspects of perceptual, cognitive, and motor behaviors are interrelated also has the potential to advance technological innovations, e.g., in cognitive neural prosthetics, a novel human-computer interface for helping paralyzed patients and patients with amputations. Identifying the temporal interactions among cognitive, perceptual, and motor functions has other translational potential for developing new rehabilitation paradigms for populations with impaired motor and perceptual timing. <br/><br/>This research program aims to evaluate whether and how timing in perception and motor control involves shared mechanisms that ensure seamless integration and plastic co-modification. The experimental approach combines a motor skill, throwing a ball in an augmented reality environment, with a time perception task. Objective 1 explores how motor timing that emerges from discrete throwing actions modifies perceptual timing. Objective 2 extends this question to situations requiring rhythmic throwing actions. Objective 3 examines whether learned coupling of motor and perceptual timing persists in the longer term. Taken together, this quantitative approach to understanding the connections between perceptual and motor timing will contribute to developing a unified theory of timing control in real-world contexts.

Biodiversity has been declining at rapid rates during the last several decades due to habitat loss, landscape deterioration, environmental change, and human-related activities that directly and indirectly affect natural habitats. In addition to its economic and cultural value, biodiversity plays an important role in keeping an environment?s ecosystem in balance. Disrupting such processes can reduce the provision of natural resources such as food and water, which in turn yields a direct threat to human health. Protecting natural areas is fundamental to preserving biodiversity and to mitigate the effects of ongoing environmental change. This award will contribute quantitative methods to support informed decisions on conservation design and effective land use to support species sustainability. These methods integrate realistic ecological features, specific spatial properties of the selected reserves (e.g., connectivity), population dynamics within the spatial assets, and the impact of current and future threats. The educational plan will improve the skills and diversity of future generations of engineers via technical training and engagement in transdisciplinary research. The outreach activities aim to increase the students? awareness of current biodiversity and conservation challenges.<br/><br/>This award supports fundamental research on the design of portfolios of land or marine patches to support species sustainability. These design problems result in very large mixed-integer linear programs whose solutions require innovative formulations and new large-scale optimization methods. The new models and specialized algorithms will allow decision-makers to solve a variety of realistic large-scale corridor and reserve design problems that include patch-specific conservation decisions under spatial, operational, ecological, and biological requirements. These models will feature realistic objectives faced by practitioners, such as maximization of the protected area or the number of species covered and minimization of the conservation cost. The design models will embed stochastic processes to capture the species? spatiotemporal movement across the landscape and to assess the effectiveness of conservation plans, including extinction risks, mortality, and ecosystem disturbances. New bi-level and stochastic optimization models and algorithms will support the design of robust conservation areas, i.e., areas that provide acceptable levels of ecological benefits even under future extreme and adverse events affecting the landscape.

The research team will conduct an experimental and computational study of hydrogen mobility and diffusion across aluminum oxide surfaces to understand the important factors in controlling the speed of H- and D- atom transport.  This will include developing methods to control the spacing between catalytic H2/D2 activation sites and H/D reaction sites on the oxide surface.

Further development of this technique may also lead to new design strategies for selective hydrogenation catalysts. To establish this new tool, the team will use density functional theory calculations combined with machine-learning techniques to screen for spinel oxides with suitable electronic structures.

New visualization techniques emerge as society's reliance on data grows. The ways these techniques represent data affect what people see in their data: different designs support different statistical insight and can even mislead people by appearing to show patterns that are not there. Designers lack grounded, actionable guidance for when and how their visualizations might most effectively communicate the patterns they see that matter most in their data. This project will work to develop data-driven models, metrics, and tools that describe what people see in a visualization and help them assess what it means and how it can help. Outcomes are expected to help people creating or using visualizations to rapidly predict what kinds of statistical patterns a visualization might communicate and the potential for biases in these patterns. This includes significantly reducing the time and expertise barriers for creating effective visualizations, leading to more precise and trustworthy public communication through data.

Research has shown that the use of pictorial examples during the presentation of design problems can support the learning of engineering principles and design constraints. But it can also bias designers and engineering design students toward replicating the examples they were shown, even in the presence of explicit instructions not to do so, rather than seeking innovative alternative solutions. This phenomenon is known as design fixation?the tendency to adhere to elements of prior ideas or solutions to a problem. Design fixation is a significant barrier to the generation of new design ideas and creative problem solving. Intriguingly, preliminary research on engineering education has suggested there is a disciplinary difference in the tendency to show design fixation to pictorial examples, such that industrial designers are markedly less likely to fixate than are mechanical engineers. The goal of this project, a collaboration between cognitive neuroscience researchers at Drexel University and design scientists at the University of North Carolina, is to focus on this difference as a means of understanding the cognitive and neural processes underlying design fixation. The driving hypothesis is that, as a result of their training, mechanical engineering students are more likely to fixate because they are less apt to draw on abstract principles. The studies will involve a combination of behavioral and brain imaging studies of first year and fourth year undergraduate students in different design disciplines. The results of this project will have the potential to generalize across much of STEM education by informing the development of curricula to ward off design fixation. This award is made by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>Drawing on the research literature in cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, engineering education, and design science, this project will examine the premise that there are differences between undergraduate industrial design and mechanical engineering students in their tendencies to show design fixation and that these differences are arise from instruction that emphasizes the of abstraction (rule-based) learning in the former discipline and exemplar-based learning in the latter. The project will examine whether differences between students during concept building, captured by both behavioral and neural measures, can predict design fixation patterns. The researchers will collect multimodal data from first year and senior industrial design and mechanical engineering students on a design fixation task and a control design task. They will quantify design fixation behaviorally through (a) the coding of sketches according to an established design categorization scheme, and (b) the coding of verbal protocols with the established Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) ontology for design. The FBS ontology segmentation and coding of verbal protocols will then be used in a novel attempt to analyze neural responses during the design fixation and control tasks. The behavioral and neural differences in learning tendencies ? rule-based and exemplar based ? between students in the two disciplines will then be used to predict behavioral and neural differences in design fixation. Ultimately, the investigators aim to put forth a mechanistic account of design fixation, grounded in cognitive neuroscience and design theory and practice, that will inform the development of instructional interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New technological developments in this area would contribute to increasing international competitiveness of the U.S. chemical manufacturing industries and meeting relevant U.N. goals on sustainable development. A promising chemistry to this end is catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), a process that is carried out using hydrogen donors instead of pure molecular H2, thereby offering a safe, H2- and potentially CO2-free hydrogenation technology. A critical step towards deploying CTH is to optimally design the underlying process, a challenging task because atomic-scale information such as reaction thermodynamics, pathways, and rates have implications at the microscopic (e.g., product yield) and macroscopic levels (e.g., process economics). The research vision of this project is to develop and apply novel computational tools, in synergy with experiments, to design CTH processes by integrating information and decisions across the different size scales. In parallel with this research, the educational vision of this project is to promote computational thinking and programming literacy at various levels of STEM education. These two skills are well-recognized as being essential for the next generation of science and engineering innovators to tackle emerging grand challenges in the energy, health, and environmental spheres.<br/><br/>This CAREER proposal specifically aims to computationally design a vapor-phase transition-metal catalyzed CTH reaction system of a model oxygenate, viz. acrolein, which is the smallest molecule having both C-C and C-O unsaturation; as such, it can be considered a model representative of biomass-derived molecules and functionalized intermediates in the chemical industry. Designing the acrolein CTH reaction system ultimately requires identifying the optimal donor-catalyst combination that maximizes the yield of a desired product, e.g., hydrogenation selectivity of acrolein to propanal versus propenol. To this end, a novel computational framework that integrates density functional theory (DFT), informatics, machine learning, and several other process systems engineering computational methods including nonlinear optimization and advanced data sampling via reinforcement and transfer learning, will be developed as part of this research to (i) build Gaussian Process surrogate models, (ii) formulate and solve coverage-cognizant microkinetic models, and (iii) solve reaction system optimization problems. This framework will allow the PI to address a critical gap in the fundamental mechanistic elucidation and multiscale design of acrolein CTH reaction systems and thereby identify the optimal donor-catalyst combination from a representative subset of donors and transition metal catalysts. A well-integrated educational program will be developed to target different age groups at Lehigh University and the broader Lehigh valley. This includes engaging high-school and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research at the intersection of data science and catalysis, developing online interactive visualization-based modules to explain high-school science and undergraduate engineering concepts via enquiry-based learning, and developing and offering an interdisciplinary elective to train chemical engineers in the burgeoning area of data science and machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analyzing the vast amount of visual data is a challenge. Existing computer vision methods require fast computers that are beyond the computational capabilities of many edge devices. This project aims to improve the efficiency of computer vision methods so that they can run on battery-powered edge devices. Based on the visual data and complementary metadata (e.g., geographical location, local time), the project first extracts contextual information (such as a city street is expected to be busy at rush hour). The contextual information can help assist determine whether analysis results are correct. For example, a wild animal is not expected on a city street. Moreover, contextual information can improve efficiency.  Only certain pixels need to be analyzed (pixels on the road are useful for detecting cars, while pixels in the sky are not) and this can significantly reduce the amount of computation, thus enabling analysis on edge devices. This project constructs a cyberinfrastructure for three services: (1) understand contextual information to reduce the search space of analysis methods, (2) reduce computation by considering only necessary pixels, and (3) automate evaluation of analysis results based on the contextual information without human effort.<br/><br/>Understanding contextual information is achieved by using background segmentation, GPS-location-dependent logic, and image depth maps.  Background analysis leverages semantic segmentation and analysis over time to identify the background pixels and then generate inference rules via a background-implies-foreground relationship. If a pixel is consistently marked by the same semantic label across a long period of time, this pixel is classified as a background pixel. The background information can infer certain types of foreground objects. For example, if the background is city streets, the foreground objects can be vehicles or pedestrians; if a bison is detected, this is likely a mistake. This project processes only the foreground pixels by adding masks to the neural network layers. Masking convolution can substantially reduce the amount of computation with no loss of accuracy and no additional training is needed. Meanwhile, hierarchical neural networks can skip sections of a model based on context. For example, pixels in the sky only need to be processed by the hierarchy nodes that classify airplanes. The project provides an online service that can accept input data and analysis programs for automatic evaluation of the programs, without human created labels. The evaluation is based on the correlations of background and foreground objects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scientific knowledge and technological advances generated in the areas of polymer materials science, engineering and manufacturing promote economic growth and benefit society. Polymer nanofibers have widespread applications in a variety of critical industries including energy, transportation, aerospace, healthcare, electronics and sensing. Theoretically, nanofibers are expected to be stronger than larger conventional fibers, but in practice nanofibers are usually much weaker. This discrepancy arises because the manufacturing processes required to engineer ordered internal structures are difficult to apply to tiny, delicate nanofibers. This grant supports the investigation of fundamental scientific relationships associated with laser heating during polymer nanofiber stretching for exceptional control over the internal structure and resulting enhanced strength. Furthermore, the research uses a unique automated track continuous fiber-drawing system that ensures scale up and a clear path to commercialization. The project provides advanced training in materials science, advanced manufacturing and nanotechnology to numerous undergraduate and graduate students and establishes the Path to BS Research Training Program that supports underrepresented, economically disadvantaged students seeking BS degrees in Engineering.<br/><br/>Laser zone drawing has demonstrated the potential to produce polymer fibers with high tensile strengths that exceed what is possible using conventional fiber manufacturing methods. However, the fundamental thermodynamic and material processing relationships governing laser zone fiber drawing have not been studied under tightly controlled conditions, especially for polymer nanofibers. This work fills that knowledge gap by using computational models and experimental investigation of polymer fibers subject to laser heating while the mechanical properties are continuously monitored. To process entire fibers, the laser beam is sequentially scanned to rapidly heat each small portion or zone of a fiber to make it pliable so it can be stretched. Macromolecular structure development during laser zone drawing is investigated with known fiber tension and temporal zone temperature. This approach is expected to facilitate remarkable control over the final internal structure of the processed fiber and result in exceptional mechanical strength. The utilization of automated tracks allows for controlled laser zone drawing of the delicate nanofibers. The hypothesis to be tested is that the rapid heating and cooling of nanofibers, due to their high surface area-to-volume ratio, facilitates alignment of polymer chains at elevated temperatures that are locked in place during rapid cooling before chain relaxation can occur, thereby enhancing mechanical behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantification of uncertainty in these simulations is crucial to increased clinical adoption but has previously been largely disregarded due to its excessive computational cost and complexity. To address these challenges, the project leverages a new class of multi-fidelity Monte Carlo estimators for direct and inverse problems, designed to mitigate computational complexity through the solution of a large number of inexpensive low-fidelity surrogates. It demonstrates the proposed approach in full-scale clinical problems including multiple uncertainty sources at a reasonable computational budget. The project?s main objective is to create an end-to-end advanced cyberinfrastructure ecosystem for uncertainty quantification (direct problem) and parameter estimation (inverse problem) in cardiovascular models incorporating realistic sources of uncertainty, able to leverage arbitrary low-fidelity models through advanced Monte Carlo estimators, while drastically reducing computational cost and complexity. The project?s interdisciplinary team is synergizing computational modeling, cardiovascular physiology, UQ and open-source software towards making UQ tractable in full-scale 3D cardiovascular simulations, leveraging multi-fidelity estimators for the solution of both direct and inverse problems. The project will produce seamless cyberinfrastructure linking two well-regarded open-source packages, Dakota and SimVascular, with sizable user communities.<br/><br/>The project is creating new cyberinfrastructure ecosystems for large-scale UQ tasks. Dissemination to industry/academia is performed through SimVascular, a leading open-source platform for cardiovascular modeling. It will leverage SimVascular and the proposed multi-fidelity estimators to create hands-on teaching material for graduate and undergraduate courses. Although the project focuses on cardiovascular modeling, its results are directly applicable to other engineering problems. The PIs will organize minisymposia and workshops at national conferences. They will lead outreach activities to local K-12 schools to attract girls and underrepresented minority (URM) students to STEM. The PIs will mentor URM summer students through the SURF program and women students through the Women in Mathematics, Scientific Computing and Engineering (WiMSCE) group at Stanford.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reproductive structures perform the most critical function for the evolutionary success of a species. However, fundamental knowledge, particularly of the mechanical functions of reproductive structures in females and how they interact with male structures during reproduction, is lacking. This project uses an integrative approach that includes developing new analytical tools to explain the physical properties of reproductive structures, particularly how the tissues are arranged, and how they perform their functions. Snakes are an excellent model system in which to address these questions, because they have diverse ecologies and mating systems that can be leveraged to test hypotheses about how these forces shape the morphological and functional diversity of reproductive structures and their interactions. The principal investigator will train a number of undergraduate students, targeting recruitment of students from groups underrepresented in science. These students will learn a range of biological techniques, develop skills in mathematics and engineering, and complete publishable thesis projects. The students will also participate in the creation of a podcast to disseminate knowledge about reproduction to the general public and will prepare 3-D printed materials for an exhibit at Mount Holyoke College. The project will involve participation and training of a post-doctoral scholar who will help mentor students. The principal investigator will develop a Faculty Seminar involving diverse Humanities and Biology professors from five regional colleges to foster cross-disciplinary conversations and to develop a new interdisciplinary undergraduate course on biological and social aspects of reproduction; the course materials will be made available to others. <br/><br/>This integrative project examines male and female reproductive morphology in snakes to understand how biomechanical, morphological, and sensory features affect function and coevolution of copulatory structures that have a direct mechanical interaction. The project develops a comprehensive framework for the study of genital coevolution, by explicitly including analysis of female copulatory structures which are often not considered in this type of research. The project uses high-resolution 3-D shape measurements, materials science-based characterization of reproductive tract tissues, and quantification of sensory innervation of genitalia to examine snake copulatory organs and genital shape covariation between males and females, as well as their integration with life history traits. The integration of these multiple data streams to test specific hypotheses provides a novel framework to differentiate among mechanisms of genital coevolution that remain difficult to disentangle. The project is led by a Latina junior faculty member at Mount Holyoke College, a gender-inclusive women?s college that serves a diverse student body and has a strong track record of sending women to PhD programs in the life sciences. This research will increase engagement of undergraduate students of color in science by supporting summer research programs aimed to increase participation in honors theses leading to publication. Students will participate in a combined biology and mathematics independent research experience in collaboration with faculty from the Math Department. In addition, a postdoctoral researcher will be mentored in all aspects of running an independent laboratory at a liberal arts college.

The project investigates the cultural factors behind the destruction of a massive industrial operation at the hands of insurgents opposed to the recent annexation of the region by the United States. Previous archaeological studies of industrial-era labor in the region tend to anatomize moments of violent class conflict, while industrial studies across the United States typically work to refine typologies of resistance for the period more generally. This project breaks new ground by addressing the question of insurgent motivation, approaching the architecture of the industrial operation as an actor in the process, shaping patterns of raw materials consumption, human resource use, and industrial waste disposal. Associated field and laboratory research will create opportunities for descendant and local community engagement, encouraging the co-production of anthropological knowledge and enriching the education of student participants. The project will serve as a model for the employment of High Impact Practices among underserved student populations by including undergraduate students from a Hispanic Serving Institution in collaborative research with various local elders and high school students. <br/><br/>Laborers at the industrial operation site milled much of the region?s wheat and manufactured enormous volumes of whiskey during the seventeen years the site was in operation. That work produced cultural, natural, and economic ripple effects in the region that may have played some role in the site?s selection for destruction by rebels. Researchers will work to improve anthropological and historical understandings of the outfit?s efforts by surveying the site and its surrounds, analyzing industrial, architectural, and other materials recovered in associated excavation, and by carrying out relevant experiments in architectural energetics. They will address questions regarding the degree to which human and natural resources were used in construction and day-to-day operations at the site, comparing the relative volumes of labor, water, and wood consumed in relation to those of nearby farming, ranching, and industrial outfits as indicated by documentary evidence. The project brings together the methodological and analytical techniques of historical archaeology, experimental archaeology, and ethnohistory to describe aspects of the operation likeliest to produce resource strain and exacerbate local inequalities.

Application of optimal control to such Partial Differential Equations systems will lead to a significant reduction in the energy utilization and improve sustainability in the residential and transportation sectors, however such benefits are contingent upon the ability of the control algorithm to satisfy input and state constraints.

The resulting fluorophores (light-emitting structures) are expected enable the imaging of metal ions in live cells by using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy. This project will explore the synthesis, optical and electrochemical properties of these dye molecules. Fluorescent probes have become indispensable tools in modern biology and biotechnology because they provide real time information concerning the quantity of ions or molecules of interest within the living cell. Thus, the probes developed in this project may spur significant advances in our understanding of metal-cell biology. Developing near-infrared fluorescent probes for metal ions that behave well under physiological conditions is highly desirable. The project enriches education and training of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups by involving them in cutting-edge research activities. Students will develop laboratory expertise in microwave-assisted synthesis, spectroscopic analysis, and fluorescence imaging.<br/><br/>The central theme of this project is that principles of organic chemistry, microwave-assisted synthesis and knowledge of photochemistry can be exploited to make an array of molecular tools capable of investigating biological metal ions. Efforts will be focused on the development of cyanine-coupled dye derivatives with good water solubility, cell permeability and photostability. This project includes the following aims:  (1) to develop an efficient microwave-assisted synthesis and characterization of near-infrared dye molecules; (2) to examine the spectroscopic,  computational, and electrochemical properties of cyanine-coupled dye derivatives by diverse methods; and (3) to investigate the potential of cyanine-coupled dye derivatives for imaging of metals in HeLa cells.

This enabling technology allows engineering systems to live up to their full potential by operating at the limit of their specifications. Model Predictive Control (MPC) achieves this objective by solving an optimal control problem at every sampling instant. However, doing so requires a large number of computations in a relatively short amount of time, making the approach challenging to implement on high frequency engineering applications. This award supports fundamental research for the development of a new constrained control paradigm that combines systems theory, numerical methods, and algorithmic optimization to reduce the computational effort and hardware requirements of MPC.  Results from this research will enable the widespread adoption of MPC in the aerospace, automotive, energy, and robotic industries, thus benefitting the U.S. economy and society. <br/><br/>Hypersampled MPC can reduce the computational burden of traditional MPC by decoupling the prediction model, used to formulate the optimal control problem, from the control model, used to prove that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and satisfies constraints.

This research project will lay the foundational groundwork for Hypersampled MPC and investigate its implications on how to handle warm-starting, preconditioning, implicit recursions, parametric uncertainties, and disturbance rejection.

This project will investigate how students? understanding of scale and number sense (numeracy) can be improved in virtual reality (VR). Research shows that students of all ages hold inaccurate ideas about the size of scientifically relevant entities. For instance, students have difficulty distinguishing the magnitude of difference between the sizes of molecules and cells, or between Earth?s moon and the sun. Because many STEM fields?from virology to astronomy?involve work conducted at extremes of scale, students must develop accurate conceptions of scales that exist well beyond their everyday experience of the world. An inaccurate understanding of scale can obscure the applicability of numeric representation to the real world and become a barrier for entry to STEM. This project will create Scale Worlds, an immersive virtual environment, where students can see various scientific entities in relation to their own bodies and conduct realistic size comparisons that cannot be replicated in everyday experience. <br/><br/>Inside Scale Worlds, scientific entities?such as a blue whale and a water molecule?will be distributed among distinct environments, each of which corresponds to a different exponent in scientific notation. Students will be able to see their own bodies and increase or decrease in size relative to these entities, with numeric symbols in scientific and standard notation serving as the primary means of navigation. Development of Scale Worlds will include the iterative design of 31 distinct environments with multimodal experiential cues that reinforce scale, analytical evaluation with usability experts in VR, and formative evaluation with non-expert students. A comparative study with middle school and undergraduate students will assign participants to a projection-based virtual environment (or ?CAVE?), head-mounted VR display, or non-VR desktop simulation condition, with the desktop condition being the lowest level of immersion. A subsequent study will observe students? precise body movements along with corresponding verbalizations in two versions of Scale Worlds: one with the full feature set of structural elements and multimodal experiential cues, and the other with a reduced feature set. This will offer insight into the impact of these features on engagement. Project outcomes include: (a) two validated versions of a scaling environment that reinforces scientific and standard notation; (b) virtual reality usability guidelines; (c) recommendations for STEM educators on technology use; and (d) publicly accessible lesson plans for leveraging Scale Worlds for STEM learning and numeracy, which will be developed in partnership with practicing teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research agenda consists of two tasks designed to seek answers to these questions.  Task 1 investigates the impacts of modularity and co-modality via analysis and simulation.  Task 2 recruits and surveys potential stakeholders for their views on a wide range of issues related to the adoption of AMVT-BM. The project will create a suite of optimization tools for analyzing modularized transit and last-mile delivery service systems.  It will also develop the first of its kind simulation testbed to guide the design and evaluation of an AMVT-BM system that integrates transit and last-mile delivery operations. Through a three-phase stakeholder survey, the project will document and analyze technological, institutional, and financial potentials as well as barriers to the real-world implementation of AMVT-BM systems, which will shed light on the design and operation of these systems. The project findings will help identify critical future research agenda.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamic active polymers promise numerous applications ranging from healthcare to aerospace. As a notable example, adaptable liquid-crystal elastomers have the great potential to become a transformative actuator material that mimics the major functions of biological muscle (i.e., protection, actuation, self-healing), which will bring man-made machines closer to the natural capabilities of humans while greatly extending their applications. However, existing mechanics theories cannot fully accommodate the sophisticated coupling among the new chemistry, physics, and mechanics involved in these emerging active polymers. The project's theory will establish a clear connection between the dynamic molecular bonding and material energy dissipation, mechanical, and interfacial properties, which serves as an effective tool for the application-driven design and manufacturing with active polymers. The educational objective of this grant is to promote students' interest in engineering, enhance their learning of mechanics concepts, and prepare them with critical skills to meet the challenges in polymer engineering.

Blackwell of the University of Wisconsin?Madison is studying the chemical signals that bacteria use to communicate with each other. This signaling pathway is extremely important, as many common bacteria use it to cause infections and disease in humans, animals, and plants. However, little is known about these signals and how they function. This NSF project aims to study the chemical signals used by one class of bacteria, to design and use chemistry to make signals that the bacteria cannot make themselves, and apply these non-natural signals to activate and inhibit bacterial communications pathways on demand. This chemical approach will allow for the signaling pathway to be explored in new ways and in important, biologically relevant environments, and will provide fundamental new insights into how it works. This project will have additional broad impacts. It will provide ample opportunities for training students in modern scientific techniques, thereby preparing them for advanced careers in science. In addition, through collaboration with an artist, the project will provide artwork (for viewing in person and online) that will communicate the presence of bacteria, their chemical signaling networks, and their global importance to the general public. <br/><br/>This research project is motivated by the incredible ability of bacteria to act as a group at high cell number and initiate behaviors that can have devastating effects on humanity. This process is called ?quorum sensing? (QS). Gram-positive bacteria use agr-type, two-component signaling systems for QS that are reliant on autoinducing peptide (AIP) signals. The reliance of common bacteria on a chemical language of small peptides places organic chemists and chemical biologists in a unique position to uncover the fundamental principles underlying this communication network and design new tools to modulate it at the molecular level. Professor Blackwell's laboratory is making important contributions to the development of non-native peptides and small molecules capable of either blocking or activating agr-type QS in the Staphylococci. Many questions remain to be addressed about the mechanisms and potential utility of these non-native compounds. The current project seeks to leverage this strong foundation of research and significantly expand the PI?s program to address several key challenges in the QS field over the next three years. The following three integrated and cross-disciplinary aims are to be pursued here: (1) apply chemical synthesis to develop physically robust, next-generation ligands to target agr-type QS with improved activity profiles; (2) apply biochemistry to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which these ligands interact with agr QS systems; and (3) apply modern molecular biology to advance new methods to expedite the identification and production of QS ligands (both native and non-native). Together, the results of these studies have the potential to significantly refine the understanding of agr-type QS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many metal surfaces can catalyze important chemical reactions; however, metals with the highest catalytic activity include some of the rarest and most expensive elements, such as palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt).  When these single atom alloys (SAAs) are exposed to hydrogen gas (H2), the Pd atoms dissociate the H2 molecules into H atoms, which spillover onto the Cu surface.  Working with his students, Dr. Trenary is using sophisticated spectroscopies to study hydrogenation reactions between the weakly bound H atoms on the surface and small organic molecules. The project could advance our understanding of catalytic hydrogenation reactions, and could lead to the development of new catalytic materials that minimize the use of expensive metals. <br/><br/>The project is using polarization dependent reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) under ambient pressure conditions to characterize the fundamental steps of hydrogenation reactions. Through analysis of the infrared spectra, Professor Trenary and his students monitor the evolution of gas phase products while also characterizing adsorbed surface species. The methodology is applied to selective hydrogenation reactions such as acetylene to ethylene, acrolein to 2-propenol, and 1,3-butadiene to butene over the Pt/Cu(111) and Pd/Cu(111) SAAs. In addition to RAIRS experiments, the properties of the surfaces and their hydrogenation chemistry are being studied with a variety of other techniques including temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). For each hydrogenation reaction, the objective is to obtain information on the identity of reaction intermediates and to distinguish them from spectator species.

Docks and sorrels provide a particularly powerful system for studying the evolutionary development of these phenomena because two distinct sex chromosome systems are present in this plant group. Additionally, preliminary evidence suggests that some of these plants may have an unusual evolutionary reversal from sex chromosome-determined unisexuality to a loss of sex chromosomes and sex separation. Confirmation of this pattern by this project would change the way researchers think about the evolution and formation of these chromosomal arrangements in plants. Undergraduates from Howard University will participate in this research, collaborating with a scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, and researchers will participate in a variety of outreach activities to educate the general public and Howard University students about the evolution and diversity of plant sex determination and the project?s findings.<br/><br/>Heteromorphic sex chromosomes are rare in plants. Yet, despite this rarity, plants provide a compelling system in which to study the development of sex determination and its control at the chromosomal level because in plants, unlike in vertebrate animals, these evolutionary processes are often relatively recent. Among plant groups, Rumex in particular provides a unique system for investigating the evolutionary development of these phenomena because two separate sex chromosome systems are present in the genus. For this project, the researchers will use next-generation sequencing techniques to construct a high-quality de novo nuclear genome for one species with a heteromorphic chromosome system, Rumex acetosa, and lower coverage genome assemblies for 25 other Rumex species, representing diversity in reproductive system. With the data generated from this project, the researchers will be able to unravel the evolutionary origins of complex reproductive systems and reconstruct sex chromosome structure in the genus.

The proposed research will focus on the ergodicity and random fluctuations of spatial averages, which are related to observed characteristics in particular physical models.  A second objective of the project is to broaden the range of applications of the stochastic calculus of variations, also called Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin calculus is a mathematical theory that extends the classical calculus of variations from functions to stochastic processes. It has proven to be a powerful tool in deriving rates of convergence in central limit theorems, which are of great relevance in statistical inference. Particular emphasis will be put in the analysis of random processes with long memory which are useful to handle data coming from finance, telecommunications and other areas. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>A first working block of the project consists in establishing  quantitative central limit theorems for spatial averages of a wide class of stochastic partial differential equations driven by a Gaussian noise which has homogeneous covariance. Challenging problems are the case of the three dimensional wave equation driven by a noise which is white in time and it has a Riesz covariance in space, and also the case of noises which are rougher that the white noise. Establishing the rate for probability densities using techniques of Malliavin calculus is  a central goal of the project. A second working block deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of functionals of the fractional Brownian motion related to local times. An innovative methodology based on the Clark-Ocone formula will be developed.

These mantle domains are characterized by high ratios of the isotopes 3He to 4He (3He/4He).  Much work has been done to understand how these mantle domains within Earth?s interior have escaped melting in the face of billions of years of mantle convection and plate tectonics. New observations of these high 3He/4He domains suggest that, rather than reflecting previously unmelted portions of the mantle, these domains may be the result of Earth?s core leaking into the mantle. Through this leak, pristine noble gases from the core imprint their helium ratios on mantle rocks that sit above the core-mantle boundary. Subsequently, the mantle rocks are transported to the surface and sampled by intraplate volcanism. This project will involve experiments using metal and magma at temperatures and pressures similar to the Earth?s core to explore the question of whether the core is the source of the high 3He/4He found in parts of the mantle. If true, and the core is the source, this would provide new information about the chemistry of the core and would mean that high 3He/4He mantle domains may not, in fact, be unmelted and pristine. This helps us understand Earth?s early evolution.<br/>    <br/>This proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that the core can be the ultimate high 3He/4He source.  Experiments will be conducted that react metal and magma under controlled conditions that range up to the pressures and temperatures directly applicable to core formation within Earth. The noble gas distribution in the experiments will be analyzed using laser-ablation mass spectrometry.  These analyses will yield constraints regarding the ability of the core to incorporate noble gases during its creation. These constraints will be applied towards developing a core formation model that predicts the isotopic composition of the core for both He and Xe for various plausible formation conditions.  Important model parameters include core formation timing, nature of Earth?s primordial atmosphere, the prevailing redox state associated with core formation, and core formation pressure-temperature conditions. Model predictions will be compared to existing geochemical analyses to identify if the core is a plausible source of high 3He/4He noble gases.

This field is concerns functions with Fourier transform (frequencies) supported (non-zero at most) on some curved objects such as a sphere or a cone. Such functions appear naturally in several areas of science and mathematics: in the study of Schrödinger equations, wave equations and number theory. For instance, a solution to the linear wave equation can be represented as a function with Fourier transform supported on a cone. Investigating these functions allows one to understand how waves evolve in time. In number theory, one can count the number of integer solutions to some Diophantine equations (polynomial equations with integer coefficients) by estimating such functions. Namely, if the corresponding functions are concentrated, then one expects the Diophantine equation to have many integer solutions. And an upper bound on the number of solutions can be given in terms of how spread out the functions are. This project will be focused on how the curvature of the Fourier support prevents the functions from being concentrated.<br/><br/>The work will be concentrated on oscillatory integrals and related to Falconer's conjecture.

The ability of marshes to migrate inland as waters rise is considered a first-order determinant of their future survival. This project is specifically designed to determine the influence of subtle marsh topography on how, when, and where marshes retreat inland. This project will have broad educational impacts by engaging a large number of undergraduate students in field work, design and implementation of a new field teaching laboratory, and a new field-based undergraduate course. Educational aspects of this work are designed to prepare the next generation of geoscientists to address scientific and societal issues related to coastal zone stability. Informal learning for the general public includes the creation of an interactive digital kiosk for the University of South Carolina Aiken Ruth Patrick Science and Education Center designed to increase public awareness of environmental and socio-economic issues associated with coastal zone response to climate and land use change.<br/><br/>The primary scientific objective of this project is to quantify the topographic controls on overmarsh flow, sedimentation, and water residence times across a salt marsh ? forest continuum within the ACE Basin, SC. The marsh-forest continuum encompasses a natural salt marsh, a reclaimed rice field marsh or ?ag-marsh?, and an ag-marsh-forest ecotone, allowing for a space-for-time substitution to advance knowledge on the geomorphic controls on marsh morphodynamics across various marsh types and stages of development. It is hypothesized that the artificial drainages of ag-marshes facilitate hydraulic connectivity of surface flows within and between marsh systems, and with neighboring uplands, thereby enhancing inundation extent and residence times, and influencing rates and patterns of forest-marsh transgression. Hence, this project will help illuminate the role of ag-marsh landscapes as corridors for inland marsh migration in response to sea-level rise. Field observations of in-channel and overmarsh flows, and modern and historic sedimentation rates will be evaluated in the context of marsh topography, drainage structure, hydraulic connectivity and vegetation effects. A computer model will be developed to predict salt marsh response to natural and anthropogenic forcing across local and regional spatial scales, and at hourly to multi-decadal time scales.

Whether scanning the road for hazards while driving or looking for a can of soup in a grocery store, people constantly search through complex visual environments to locate objects of interest.  Despite its importance, many basic questions about the brain processes involved in visual search remain unanswered.  One such question is how eye movements are controlled by the brain during visual search.  Humans generate rapid, ballistic eye movements called saccades which are used to focus attention on important objects.  These eye movements occur about 2-3 times per second and are generated approximately 100,000 times per day.  However, scientists are only beginning to understand how these saccadic eye movements are controlled by different brain areas.  The current project aims to bridge this gap in knowledge by developing a new technique to simultaneously measure eye movements (via infrared eye tracking) and neural activity (via electroencephalography; EEG).  Combining these two types of data will allow us to directly examine attentional processes in the brain that occur just before eye movements are generated.  This project will lead to a better understanding of the basic neuroscience underlying eye movements.  The knowledge gained from this project will also help provide key insights about visual search in applied settings such as radiological screening, transportation baggage security, and motor vehicle traffic control.<br/><br/>This project will explore how the brain controls eye movements to search through complex images.  Prior research has identified two mechanisms of visual attention in humans.  First, saccadic eye movements are used to rapidly fixate objects of interest.  These ballistic eye movements occur many times per second and can be directly monitored using infrared eye-tracking cameras.  Second, humans can also covertly attend objects without moving the eyes.  That is, people can monitor an object ?out of the corner of their eye? without directly looking at the object.  Interestingly, previous research has developed techniques to directly measure covert attention using EEG to noninvasively monitor neural activity from visual cortex in the brain.  However, a major shortcoming of this past research is that it used search tasks that prohibited eye movements because they result in noisy voltage fluctuations that make EEG waveforms impossible to interpret.  As a result, little is known about how the brain uses covert attention to coordinate eye movements during everyday visual search.  The current project aims to resolve this by developing a new technique to measure brain activity that occurs just before eye movement are generated.  The PI will measure shifts of covert attention (via EEG) and eye movements (via infrared eye tracking) concurrently.  During analysis, the PI will then examine the EEG waveform during the period of time prior to the eye movement for markers of covert attentional selection.  Specifically, the PI will assess whether the N2pc component?a gold-standard EEG measurement of attentional orienting?occurs just before eye movements are generated to a visual stimulus.  Additionally, this project will involve a virtual workshop to train promising young researchers approaches computer programming in cognitive neuroscience.  The ultimate goals of this project are to understand how covert attentional systems in the brain are used to guide eye movements during visual search and to develop better cognitive neuroscience models of visual attention in humans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this reason, many conceptually-oriented mathematics instructional approaches emphasize peer-to-peer discussion. Yet research diverges around questions of how teachers should manage such discussions, an instructional practice referred to as groupwork monitoring. There is contradictory guidance on issues of teacher involvement: should teachers stand back to support student autonomy or involve themselves frequently to support productive sensemaking? This study addresses two open questions in mathematics education and teacher learning research related to groupwork monitoring. The first question centers on groupwork monitoring itself: How can teachers foster productive mathematical talk among students? The second question touches on an underdeveloped topic in teacher education: in what ways can teacher preparation and professional development support teachers in learning effective group work monitoring. Many teacher education strategies  ?? such as rehearsing routines or learning curriculum ?? aim for teachers to learn well-structured, predictable aspects of instruction, yet there are not clear approaches in helping teachers learn to support more interactive and emergent aspects of mathematics teaching. This Design and Development project addresses these challenges by studying experienced and accomplished secondary mathematics teachers? learning about groupwork monitoring in a large urban school district. Using contemporary information visualization techniques and open-source tools , alongside a video-based coaching activity, teachers will a) analyze classroom video records featuring group math discussions and b) uncover and investigate their specific interactions with student groups as well as their overall approach to this important phase of their lessons. Through these tools, teachers will develop strategic and integrated understandings of effective groupwork monitoring strategies. As a result of this work, teachers and researchers will be able to better connect teachers? monitoring choices to students? peer-to-peer math talk.<br/><br/>To investigate how experienced secondary mathematics teachers learn about groupwork monitoring, the project will develop rich visualization tools to analyze classroom discussions, engage teachers in analytical activities, and study resultant teacher and student learning. In Phase 1, the project team will build on existing visualization tools to develop efficient processes for producing interactive visualizations of monitoring that provide new ways to link classroom video to teachers? overall interactional patterns. In Phase 2,  12-16 experienced secondary mathematics teachers in six school-based teams will engage over a two-year period with teacher professional development designed to enhance their sensemaking about monitoring, both individually and in teams. The enhanced video feedback system will allow teachers to guide, document, and investigate their evolving sensemaking. In Phase 3, individual and team learning portraits of productive math talk will be developed from the rich corpus of classroom and teacher sensemaking data. At the same time, the corpus will be analyzed using quantitative methods to investigate the conditions under which different teacher monitoring moves support or impede students? productive math talk. The primary research products will be: 1) novel, open-source tools that dynamically visualize teachers? monitoring work over a lesson, coordinated with specific teacher-group interaction; 2) a framework for mathematics teachers? monitoring; 3) a theory about teachers? learning of responsive and situated practices, of which monitoring is an example; and 4) stronger empirical evidence to guide mathematics teachers? monitoring practices. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Photosensitizers are compounds that can trap the energy of light and use it to effect a useful chemical reaction. Examples of this include solar energy conversion, catalysis, and photodrugs. This project focuses on a particular class of such photosensitizers that show promise in cancer therapy, but have many unanswered questions about their mode of action. The work will investigate the fundamental photophysical and electrochemical properties of oligothiophene-containing ruthenium compounds specifically, and reveal the details of photocatalytic mechanisms in which they can participate. It will also explore how the behavior of these photosensitizers can change as a function of its environment, e.g., agglomeration effects and the influence of simulated biological structures. The proposed work will train graduate and undergraduate students in highly multidisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry, biology, physics, and engineering. The knowledge and skills these trainees will acquire will give them tools necessary for success as future research scientists in cutting-edge multidisciplinary fields ranging from photomedicine to solar energy conversion and chemical biology. The broader impact objectives will simultaneously equip tomorrow?s leaders with skills in science communication and expose them to entrepreneurship and commercialization as it relates to bringing scientific discoveries from the laboratory to society. It will also provide curriculum-based research opportunities for undergraduate students that would otherwise not have the opportunity to experience scientific research in a real-world laboratory setting, expanding diversity in our next generation of emerging scientists.<br/><br/>This project project will examine the excited state photophysics and redox properties of oligothiophene-containing Ru(II) complexes, compounds that have important applications as photosensitizers in fields ranging from solar energy conversion to photodrugs.  The project also aims to develop the photophysical model(s) for these photosensitizers in complex biological environments. We will synthesize and characterize oligothiophene-appended Ru(II) photosensitizers, [Ru(LL)2(IP-nT)]2+ that differ in the number of thiophene rings (nT), the types of substituents on the thiophene rings, and the co-ligands (LL). The modifications are designed to systematically vary redox potentials and triplet state characteristics, and to alter the covalent and noncovalent associations typical of oligothiophenes. Electrochemical and photophysical techniques will be used to test hypothetical photoredox catalysis mechanisms in complex substrates, where synthetic and cell-derived vesicles will be used to model how photosensitizer response modulates in confined matrices, e.g., a lipid bilayer. The results will advance the field of Ru(II)-oligothiophene photosensitization. With a mechanistic understanding of oligothiophene-containing Ru(II) photosensitizers, there exists the opportunity to create better next-generation photosensitizers for photocatalytic applications. The broader impact activities are equally focused on exposing STEM scientists to science communication and entrepreneurship based on past translational research and commercialization efforts related to light-molecule interactions. The training program will cover outreach, education, and curriculum, emphasizing the process from fundamental discovery to societal application, and provide opportunities for researchers to improve their science communication skills. Curriculum-based research opportunities for undergraduate STEM students will be designed and delivered to ensure that a larger percentage of these students receive hands-on research experience during their degree programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tidal floods occur when high tides rise up into sewers, streets, and sidewalks. During this process, the floods can move pollutants from land into coastal waters. In spite of the strong potential for this pollution to impact human and ecological health, coastal water quality hazards caused by tidal floods are not well understood. The goal of this CAREER project is to study the ways in which tidal floods impact coastal water quality specifically focusing on fecal contamination. This goal will be achieved through the use of highly novel sensing and modeling systems that will be developed to monitor, explain, and predict water quality following tidal floods. Successful completion of this project will help engineers, local governments, and policymakers understand and mitigate risks caused by persistent tidal floods. Science teachers and undergraduate students will participate in the research and engage middle and high school students in environmental engineering, coastal sustainability, and data sciences. These efforts will increase scientific literacy and build the Nation?s STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of how tidal floods and stormwater runoff interact to influence pollution loading in nearshore waters. The specific focus of this research is on Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB), a commonly used marker of sewage pollution, in order to develop explanatory and predictive models to inform the design of sustainable coastal stormwater infrastructure. To achieve this goal, the project will carry out the following research objectives: (1) measure nearshore FIB concentrations at high frequencies using novel sensing technologies, (2) develop mechanistic and statistical models to explain FIB concentration dynamics during tidal floods and storm events, as well as over longer timescales of multiple tidal cycles; and (3) develop a predictive model framework for generating near-term forecasts of bacterial contamination risk in nearshore waters. Successful completion of this project will advance process-based understanding of how storms and tidal floods influence nearshore FIB loading, information that is needed to develop engineering solutions to mitigate hazards caused by climate change. The use of FIB concentrations (a widely used pollution marker) will facilitate the use of this research by a diverse group of regulators, natural resource managers, and other decision-makers. Additionally, the investigator will develop educational programming that will: (1) train undergraduate students and secondary school science teachers in foundational principles of coastal observation and data science through involvement in research, (2) engage ~12,000 middle and high school students in coastal and data sciences, and (3) create an open-access digital repository of coding lessons that have learning objectives focused on environmental engineering foundations and data analysis skills.

Epithelial tissues are the thin protective layers of cells that cover the inner and outer surfaces of organs. Throughout the body, one of the main functions of epithelial surfaces is lubrication. However, most of our understanding of epithelial lubrication comes from the study of fluids at epithelial surfaces, neglecting the mechanical behaviors of the cells themselves. This award supports fundamental research to establish the connection between epithelial lubrication and the mechanical behaviors of cells in monolayers. Pharmaceutical interventions are known to alter the mechanical properties of cells and tissues.  These will be used to uncover the underlying mechanical contributions to epithelial lubrication. This new knowledge will increase understanding of diseases of the epithelium and identify new potential therapies. Therefore, results from this research will ultimately benefit human health and society. This research brings together several disciplines including tribology (the study of friction and wear), cell mechanics, active matter physics, and physiology.  The convergence of multiple disciplines and the potential societal impacts of this work will aid in broadening participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in research and expand engineering education.  <br/><br/>The research aims to discover new principles of monolayer lubrication, guided by the central hypothesis that the mechanically relevant timescales associated with cell motion and intercellular fluid transport in monolayers generate multiple distinct regimes of lubrication. The rationale for this work is that new perspectives on epithelial tissue function and pathologies will emerge from rebuilding current understanding of epithelial lubrication on a foundation derived from collective cell motion and mechanics. The research team will classify and quantify collective motion in different types of monolayer, establish how cell motion and monolayer properties control indentation dynamics, and develop lubrication curves with connections to collective cell motion and monolayer material and transport properties.  Living analogs to classic lubrication phenomena like fluid ""squeeze films,"" poroelasticity, boundary lubrication, mixed lubrication, and hydrodynamic lubrication will be linked to collective cell motion, mechanics, and intercellular fluid transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

HEAs have generated considerable interest as potential structural materials for use under harsh conditions due to their superior mechanical properties and chemical stability compared to traditional alloys. Despite all of the promise that HEAs hold, little is known about their surface structure and properties upon simultaneous mechanical impacts and chemical reactions under harsh environments. This collaborative research between Virginia Tech and the University of Alabama aims to develop a scientific understanding of the structure and formation mechanism of the surface of HEAs after simultaneous wear and rusting (i.e. tribocorrosion) in chloride-containing aqueous solution (e.g. seawater). By combining advanced surface characterization tools and multi-scale computer simulations, the link between surface defects,  deformation, and tribocorrosion susceptibility of HEAs will be established. This project will lead to the design of metals with high tribocorrosion resistance for critical applications which require high wear and rust resistance under harsh conditions. The highly cross-disciplinary research activities will provide graduate students with diverse training in materials science, tribology, corrosion, and computational materials science, as well as the collaborative teamwork experience. It will also positively impact several education and outreach initiatives, especially the involvement of underrepresented groups via research opportunities at Virginia Tech and the University of Alabama.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Our current understanding of the tribocorrosion mechanisms of HEAs is mainly challenged by a lack of understanding of the selective dissolution/oxidation of principal elements, as well as the new deformation physics at/below the surface. The synergy between mechanical and chemical attack drastically alters the materials? surface condition and corrosion susceptibility, especially for Cr-containing HEAs that rely on a thin yet protective surface oxide layer (i.e. passive layer) for corrosion protection in air and water. This project will combine advanced surface characterization and multi-scale simulations to reveal how frictional sliding-induced depassivation leads to the formation of far-from-equilibrium microstructure and composition at the surface, and the influence of the surface electrochemistry and mechancis that act synergistically on the overall repassivation kinetics and tribocorrosion rate. Specifically, the PIs will (1) determine how alloy concentration and grain size affect wear, corrosion, and their synergy, (2) elucidate the chemistry, composition, and defect characteristics of the tribocorroded surface structure and its formation mechanism, (3) understand wear-induced defect generation and microstructure evolution using atomistic simulations, and (4) develop an experimentally validated, predictive model for tribocorrosion using multiphysics simulations that incorporate rate-limiting corrosion and repassivation steps. The integrated experimental and computational approach has great potential to reduce the materials creation and deployment cycle to fabricate tribocorrosion-resistant alloys over a larger design space than traditionally known. Research opportunities and mentorship programs will be created at Virginia Tech and the University of Alabama for undergraduate students, especially for women (with both PIs serving as role models) and under-represented minorities. In addition, the proposed outreach activities will positively impact local K-12 students and the broad internet audience to promote their interest and enhance their knowledge in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both materials have attracted great attention due to their competing physical parameters. Tuning the parameters is expected to be the key to advancing the electronic and magnetic states of matter targeting new quantum technologies, but experimentally realizing the tunability is a difficult task. This project addresses exactly that point by synthesizing a new model system in which two oxides can interact with each other in an ideal two-dimensional interface. The project also investigates microscopic properties and structures using advanced spectroscopy and microscopy. These research activities relate to education for both graduate and undergraduate students. The United States desperately needs professionals with strong expertise in advanced material synthesis and characterization for both the tech industry and academia. Participating students receive state-of-the-art material synthesis training and work with scientists from National Labs. It provides an essential opportunity for students to develop their careers. The project also raises science awareness among non-STEM majors via a summer research program for prospective teachers and visiting classrooms at local public schools in Kentucky, either in person or online. These outreach activities not only provide a unique research experience to share, but also raise awareness of cutting-edge science in general.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The project investigates the two-dimensional interface between iridates and ruthenates, where strong spin-orbit interactions (SOI) and electron-correlations (U) coexist. Whereas tuning the parameters of U and SOI in condensed matter is expected to provide nontrivial states, the experimental realization of tunable U and SOI is a formidable task. The project?s atomic-scale epitaxial heterostructure approach offers a tool to control the dimensionality and the lattice-symmetry through strong interactions at a two-dimensional interface. The confluence of U and SOI of the 5d and 4d extended orbitals at the interface is expected to exhibit an unprecedented electromagnetic state. Since these new heterostructures can stabilize metastable quantum phases as their interactions are varied, the project explores the theoretically predicted phase diagrams of exotic ground states. Hence, the results of this project fill the existing gap between experiment and theory, allowing a better understanding of the strongly correlated and spin-orbit-coupled electrons in condensed matter. To this end, the project uses pulsed laser deposition with in-situ real-time monitoring techniques to develop various epitaxial heterostructures of iridates and ruthenates. Experimental characterization includes advanced spectroscopy and microscopy such as infrared spectroscopy, resonance elastic/inelastic X-ray scattering, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Participating students gain expertise in advanced material synthesis and characterization techniques.

Although the two events seem unrelated, an underlying phenomenon connects them: namely, that the interacting species benefit each other. In the first case, the bees transport pollen for the flowers thereby dispersing and aiding them in reproduction, and the flowers in turn provide nectar to the bees. Birds disperse seeds by consuming the fruit (a benefit to them) and defecating the seeds away from the parent plant. This seed dispersal helps trees from competing against their offspring. These bidirectional positive interactions between species are termed mutualisms. The aim of this project is to develop a mathematical framework to understand how mutualisms impact species dispersal ability in an ecological and evolutionary context. The outcome of this work will help to identify when dispersal should evolve for species participating in a mutualism and how it impacts the spatial spread of the species. The researchers will use their results to foster undergraduate research, implement interdisciplinary teaching modules at the University of Minnesota, and develop management strategies against co-invading mutualistic species.<br/><br/>Although there exists theory on how antagonistic interactions such as predation, competition, or parasitism impact species dispersal, there exists very little on the role of mutualisms. Current theory offers contrasting predictions on whether mutualisms promote or hinder how fast species can disperse into new areas (range expansion). More fundamentally, it is unclear whether and how dispersal ability should evolve for species participating in a mutualism. This research will therefore set up a mathematical framework that will help determine under what conditions mutualisms (through effects on demography and dispersal) speed up versus slow down range expansion of the participating species. Secondly, the research will test the conditions under which motility is evolutionarily beneficial in a spatially explicit mutualism between two microbial species. These questions will be addressed through a combination of mathematical models and a tightly controlled microbial experimental system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data-driven optimization is a commonly used tool in many industries to support complex decision making, but the resulting decisions are often susceptible to poor data quality. Stochastic optimization methods, for example, may be unduly influenced by outliers, while robust optimization methods may provide solutions that are overly cautious.  This research project investigates a new framework for data-driven optimization, intended to specifically take into account the sensitivity of solutions to data quality, and to develop methods to improve these decisions.  In addition to new undergraduate and graduate-level course modules on optimistic optimization, the educational components of this project include a summer camp module for high school girls interested in STEM, collaboration with a local science museum, and an interactive optimization-based interdiction game. <br/><br/><br/>This project will establish theoretical and algorithmic foundations for Distributionally Favorable Optimization (DFO) and investigate its applications to the areas of operations engineering under distributional distortions.  Distributionally Favorable Optimization incorporates methods to examine distributional assumption on the input data and select the optimal decision under the most-favorable distribution.  Specifically, this research will (i) establish fundamental frameworks for DFO that can substantially reduce the effects of outliers; (ii) investigate effective decomposition-based solution schemes for solving large-scale DFO models that are computationally efficient and have attractive convergent properties; (iii) explore and exploit structures such as submodularity, clustering, and covering of nonconvex DFO models, stimulating solution algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees; and (iv) develop learning-and-optimization frameworks to explore endogenous uncertainty in the DFO models.  DFO can significantly reduce the effects of outliers, potentially enabling more accurate and reliable decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project advances our understanding of controls on the timing of peak cyanobacterial growth and cyanotoxin production in rivers where blooms are becoming more common. This project monitors the Eel, Russian, and Klamath rivers in northern California and uses the data to develop predictive models of cyanobacterial growth and toxin production. This research advances the ability of managers to predict where and when toxins produced by benthic cyanobacteria reach concentrations that exceed human and animal health risk thresholds. The researchers are also broadening participation in aquatic ecosystem science by supporting a summer intern in partnership with the Klamath Basin Monitoring Program and Karuk Tribe Department of Natural Resources and by supporting a graduate student. The investigators are also organizing two experiential field trips for K-12 students in partnership with the Mid-Klamath Watershed Council.

All data and modeling approaches developed in this project are being shared publicly on web-accessible sites.<br/><br/>This project advances understanding of the timing and occurrence of cyanobacterial growth and cyanotoxin production in rivers by using high-frequency sensor data and new approaches in ecological modeling. To improve predictions of cyanobacterial growth and toxin production through time, the investigators are focusing on two questions: 1) To what degree do processes that shape overall productivity dynamics in rivers predict the growth of toxin-producing cyanobacteria? and 2) How do environmental conditions modify the relationship between cyanobacterial growth and cyanotoxin production over the growing season? These questions are being addressed through the use of aquatic environmental sensors and coupled field sampling for two years at locations with previously documented occurrences of cyanobacteria that produce anatoxins, a neurotoxin produced by many species of freshwater cyanobacteria. Data on whole-ecosystem productivity rates are being used in combination with survey data to inform a series of models testing the relative importance of drivers of cyanobacterial growth and cyanotoxin production in rivers through time.

Given the scale of online learning systems and their dependence on student self-regulation, automatic recommendation and instructional tools are crucial for students' success in online education. Ideally, these tools should provide personalized guidance to students to work with the most effective type of learning material (e.g., a problem to solve or a video lecture to watch), at the right time, to efficiently accomplish their personal study goals (e.g., to fulfill their interests or to learn a topic in the shortest time). Current solutions, however, focus on instructing one type of learning activity, ignoring the importance of studying time intervals, and only satisfying one goal for all students. This project will research a new generation of educational recommender systems towards achieving students? long-term goals by automatically detecting and balancing between their different, potentially conflicting study goals. This project will develop computational models and algorithms that can suggest various types of personalized learning activities and optimally selected study times for students. The resulting solutions will be applicable to machine learning and data mining fields, especially, to long-term utility and time-sensitive recommender systems in domains such as health and fitness. The products of this research will improve the accessibility of online education to better serve underrepresented learners. The findings can be used in the Education domain to improve students' learning. This project includes an integrated teaching plan that facilitates training the next generation of interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate students in the convergence of Computer Science and Education fields. <br/><br/>This project aims to research time-aware, multi-objective, multi-type, personalized educational recommender models and algorithms. The recommender systems designed in this project will be optimizing for students? long-term learning interests, behavioral preferences, and learning goals. They will be capable of recommending both assessed and non-assessed types of learning materials to students and modeling the best study time intervals for them. The contributions of this project are realized via three research thrusts. In the first thrust, personalized knowledge tracing models, student choice models, and behavioral preference models are designed and integrated to model long-term rewards that facilitate multi-objective recommendations. In the second thrust, the project will investigate multi-type knowledge models and algorithms to suggest both assessed (e.g., problems) and non-assessed (e.g., video lectures) learning materials to students while considering their multiple objectives. The third thrust focuses on a new modality of educational recommender systems by incorporating point process modeling to detect the continuous-time influence between different activities and find the optimal personalized return-to-study time. These research thrusts build upon educational data mining, recommender systems, temporal process modeling, and reinforcement learning literature and extend each of them while contributing actionable insights in student learning processes. To assess the results of this project, a comprehensive evaluation plan is incorporated that includes simulations, offline evaluation on real-world datasets, online integration with live systems, and user studies.

In response to the calls set forth by the Framework for K-12 Science Education and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), the field has most successfully researched and developed assessment tools for disciplinary core ideas and the science and engineering practices. The CCCs, which serve as the connective links across science domains, however, remain more abstractly addressed. Presently, science educators have little guidance for what student use of CCCs looks like or how to assess and nurture such use. This project, with its explicit attention to the CCCs, advances true three-dimensional scientific understanding in both research and the classroom. Leveraging formative assessment as a vehicle for student and teacher development taps into proven successful instructional strategies (e.g., sharing visions of successful learning, descriptive feedback, self-assessment), while also advancing formative assessment, itself, by strengthening and illustrating how these strategies may focus on the CCCs. Further, a strengths-based approach will center culturally related differences in students? use of CCCs to achieve more equitable opportunities to engage in classroom sensemaking practices. This work impacts the field of science education by 1) enabling a more thorough realization of NGSS ideals, 2) strengthening teachers? abilities to identify diverse demonstrations of CCCs, and 3) showcasing the impact of novel classroom tools to sharpen teachers? abilities to solicit, notice, and act upon evidence of emergent student scientific thinking within their instructional practices. <br/><br/>This design-based implementation research project will engage teachers in the iterative development and refinement of rubrics that support three-dimensional science understanding through formative assessment. The high school biology classrooms that compose the study site are engaged in ambitious science teaching-inspired instruction. An inductive, bottom-up approach (Brookhart, 2013) will allow researchers, teachers, and students to co-construct rubrics. Analysis of classroom observations, artifact collection, interviews with teachers and students, and expert-panel ratings will produce a rubric for each CCC that integrates relevant science and engineering practices and is applicable across a range of disciplinary core ideas. These rubrics will illustrate progressions of increasingly advanced use of each of the CCCs, to guide the construction, pursuit, and assessment of learning goals. There will be two design cycles that allow for the collection of validity evidence and produce rubrics with the potential for broad application by educators. Complementary lines of qualitative and quantitative (i.e., psychometric) analysis will contribute to development and validation of the rubrics and their formative uses.

It is important to study how ultracold chemical reactions occur in the presence of external electromagnetic fields because (1) such studies could enable scientists to steer the outcome of chemical transformations, and (2) the fundamental knowledge they provide could be used to refine and perfect theoretical models of how chemical reactions occur in complex molecular systems, potentially providing far-reaching benefits to society by enabling the design of novel molecules and materials for catalysis, photovoltaics, and energy storage and conversion. <br/><br/>This project aims to address two major limitations in the field of ultracold reaction dynamics concerning (1) the lack of a rigorous theoretical approach to account for the effects of external fields and hyperfine interactions on chemical reactivity at ultralow temperatures, and (2) the curse of dimensionality problem due to the exponential increase of computational complexity with the size of the reaction complex. To this end, the PI will develop a computationally  efficient quantum reactive scattering methodology, which will fully incorporate the effects of external electromagnetic fields and hyperfine interactions.

When magmatic interaction involves loose sediments that contain variable amounts of water or ice, the magma may behave in a variety of ways - passing through the material, causing explosions or even stopping before reaching the surface. These different behaviors influence how a volcano will erupt, and this project will enhance the ability to anticipate the behavior of future eruptions, which is vital for saving lives and protecting infrastructure. This project involves experiments that will inject 30 liters (8 gallons) of basaltic melt into different types of loose sediment - dry, wet, and frozen. The experiments provide the opportunity to characterize the conditions of magma and sediment interactions that result in these diverse behaviors. Characterization of conditions, which are limited by physical experiments will be expanded using computer simulations and comparison with natural products from an eroded volcanic field (71 Gulch, Idaho, USA). These experiments are the first of their kind and provide valuable constraints on the flow of magma into sediments and will help better interpret natural deposits of past volcanic eruptions and provide inputs for models of future activity. This project will involve the training of undergraduate and graduate students with results and facilities shared with the scientific community. At the same time, the novel nature of the experiments will provide ample opportunities to engage public interest in science and volcanoes through videos and public facing blogs. <br/><br/>The behavior of magma in the near surface directly influences the potential for eruptions and their resulting eruptive styles. To reach the surface, magma commonly must travel through unconsolidated sediments. This interaction influences the transport of magma, the stability of volcanic piles, and the potential for phreatomagmatic explosions. Meter-scale experiments of basaltic melt-sediment interactions will be integrated with computational simulations and field work to bridge the scale from experimental results and small natural deposits to a wider range of natural scenarios. The scale of the proposed experiments (mm to m) is large enough to overlap with natural systems (mm to 10?s of m). The experimental products, created using an automated plunger-driven magma extrusion device, will be both modeled numerically and compared with similar-sized natural magma-sediment deposits at the 71 Gulch Volcano, Idaho, USA. This field area contains deposits at both the experimental scale and larger, making it an ideal natural laboratory to investigate the scaling behavior of magma sediment interactions. The experimental and numerical results will be used to determine how long magma is available for mechanical mixing and thermal interactions, contributing to an understanding of how eruptions progress, and what conditions are necessary for explosive magma-sediment interactions. Specifically, the project will test two hypotheses: 1) The flow rate and temperature of the intruding magma is more important than the sedimentary host conditions in determining whether basaltic magma will pass through, mingle with, or be arrested by an unconsolidated sedimentary host at near surface conditions. 2) The textures and geometries of natural deposits of mingled basaltic magma and unconsolidated sediments can be used to estimate the flux rate and time scale at the time of formation. Experimental and numerical results will enable detailed quantitative interpretations of the forces and thermal history recorded in natural deposits in ways not previously possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fluorescent nucleobase analogues (FBAs) are an important class of molecular probes, used to understand the biochemical mechanisms that control gene expression and the maintenance and copying of the genetic code.

This project will also provide early exposure and training opportunities on physically interactive robots to the public, particularly to students in STEM programs and to K-12 educators.<br/><br/>This work focuses on intent communication and the role of the mechanical impedance of the human arm during collaborative, physical human-robot interactions. The project will measure human arm impedance during guided partner walking with the human acting either as leader or follower. In partner walking, one agent guides the other through a desired path at some desired speed. The robot will apply small transient force perturbations occasionally to the human arm and monitor the resulting arm motions to infer limb impedance. The project team will then identify the contextual modulation of arm impedance during situations where the human assumes the role of the leader and in situations where the human is the follower.  By doing so, the project team seeks to discern physical communication strategies underlying effective and intuitive physical human-robot collaborations. Finally, the project will quantify the effectiveness of the identified intent communication strategies by implementing them on a mobile robot that simulates human partnered walking. The experiments will be performed using a force-controlled over-ground interactive robot that walks together with a human in a large room monitored by a 3D motion capture system. The research and educational work of this project will lay the foundation for implementing intuitive physical communication between humans and robots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the current lack of objective biological markers of FND, its symptomology is sometimes characterized as bodily manifestations of underlying psychological illness. Scientists now understand that the mind and body exert strong influences on one another, such that the symptoms of FND and related disorders are affected by mind-body interactions. Yet current medical research focuses on the mind largely without consideration of the social and cultural contexts that shape psychological experiences. This research enhances an understanding of how socially learned expectations and meanings that people associate with their bodily sensations shape their illness experience and influence the way they perceive their symptoms. By analyzing objective markers of FND alongside perceived symptoms and experiences of the disease, and sharing results with clinical practitioners and populations, the research will provide insights that are relevant to clinical practice and support of individuals diagnosed with FND.  <br/><br/>The investigators test the hypothesis that social contexts shape how individuals experience and understand their symptoms, contributing to science in cultural anthropology that queries the effects of shared culture on health and well-being. This contrasts with hypotheses focused on how individual psychological attributes affect symptomology, instead focusing on how social relationships can reinforce or alter experiences of FND. The research uses an innovative set of research methods to gather data about the lived experiences of people with FND. The researchers test their hypothesis using mixed methods, involving intensive interviewing, questionnaires, a journaling mobile app, and a heart rate monitoring task. Findings from the research will elucidate the relationships between mindsets, social contexts, and symptom perceptions, contributing empirical evidence to test anthropological theories of embodiment and enhancing understandings of the multiple levels affecting FND. Findings will thereby contribute to scientific knowledge about how culture and biology interact to shape health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These different behaviors influence how a volcano will erupt, and this project will enhance the ability to anticipate the behavior of future eruptions, which is vital for saving lives and protecting infrastructure. This project involves experiments that will inject 30 liters (8 gallons) of basaltic melt into different types of loose sediment - dry, wet, and frozen. The experiments provide the opportunity to characterize the conditions of magma and sediment interactions that result in these diverse behaviors. Characterization of conditions, which are limited by physical experiments will be expanded using computer simulations and comparison with natural products from an eroded volcanic field (71 Gulch, Idaho, USA).

These mantle domains are characterized by high ratios of the isotopes 3He to 4He (3He/4He).  Much work has been done to understand how these mantle domains within Earth?s interior have escaped melting in the face of billions of years of mantle convection and plate tectonics. New observations of these high 3He/4He domains suggest that, rather than reflecting previously unmelted portions of the mantle, these domains may be the result of Earth?s core leaking into the mantle. Through this leak, pristine noble gases from the core imprint their helium ratios on mantle rocks that sit above the core-mantle boundary. Subsequently, the mantle rocks are transported to the surface and sampled by intraplate volcanism. This project will involve experiments using metal and magma at temperatures and pressures similar to the Earth?s core to explore the question of whether the core is the source of the high 3He/4He found in parts of the mantle. If true, and the core is the source, this would provide new information about the chemistry of the core and would mean that high 3He/4He mantle domains may not, in fact, be unmelted and pristine. This helps us understand Earth?s early evolution.<br/>    <br/>This proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that the core can be the ultimate high 3He/4He source.  Experiments will be conducted that react metal and magma under controlled conditions that range up to the pressures and temperatures directly applicable to core formation within Earth. The noble gas distribution in the experiments will be analyzed using laser-ablation mass spectrometry.  These analyses will yield constraints regarding the ability of the core to incorporate noble gases during its creation. These constraints will be applied towards developing a core formation model that predicts the isotopic composition of the core for both He and Xe for various plausible formation conditions.  Important model parameters include core formation timing, nature of Earth?s primordial atmosphere, the prevailing redox state associated with core formation, and core formation pressure-temperature conditions. Model predictions will be compared to existing geochemical analyses to identify if the core is a plausible source of high 3He/4He noble gases.  This proposal will support the training of two PhD students in cutting-edge experimental and analytical methods, the production and characterization of noble gas analytical standards that will be made available to the community, and summer internships for college students in and around New Orleans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry studies the geometry of spaces defined by polynomial equations. In addition to being one of the most ancient subjects in mathematics, algebraic geometry is also at the forefront of research in modern mathematics. Its abstract foundations are vital in the study of modern number theory, algebraic topology, representation theory, and combinatorics. At the same time, it provides powerful tools in applied mathematics, with applications including cryptography, theory of computation, convex optimization, computer graphics, statistics, and machine learning. This project aims to study one of the most fundamental questions in algebraic geometry, namely classifying algebraic varieties. A moduli space is itself an algebraic variety whose points are in one-to-one correspondence with the algebraic varieties that are being classified. Moduli spaces provide us with rich information about the geometric objects being classified and moreover have deep applications in numerous other fields of mathematics, both pure and applied. The research objectives are twofold: to develop abstract foundational tools in moduli theory and then apply these tools to study specific moduli spaces. This project will also involve the training of graduate students in moduli theory research.<br/><br/>The investigator has developed a new approach to construct projective moduli spaces of objects with positive dimensional automorphism groups. While the moduli space of stable curves classifies objects with finite automorphism groups, there are many other moduli spaces of interest that do not share this feature. Examples include the moduli of vector bundles or sheaves, the moduli of Bridgeland semistable complexes, and the moduli of K-semistable varieties. Recent developments have provided necessary and sufficient conditions for an algebraic stack to admit a good moduli space in characteristic 0. This result has already been applied to construct new projective moduli spaces of Bridgeland semistable objects and K-semistable Fano varieties. This approach rests on local structure theorems for algebraic stacks which, at the moment, are limited to characteristic 0. This project aims to extend these results to positive and mixed characteristics. At the same time, the project aims to apply recent advances to study specific moduli spaces of varieties such as modular descriptions of log canonical models of the moduli space of curves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second is related to the new methods for dealing with the collections of transformations of (the gauge group) for non-compact spaces with applications to Ricci flow.  The mean curvature flow?s computational and theoretical study and its applications as well as that of other similar flows have had enormous impact in diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics, theoretical physics,material science, and engineering.  For broader impacts the PI will continue mentoring and advising graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, write a second graduate level book on ?Heat equation in Analysis, Geometry and Probability"", and disseminate their work via lectures, workshops and conferences.<br/><br/>In mean curvature flow (MCF) the project will study questions about stable structures; both for hypersurfaces and submanifolds of higher codimension.  In the second project a new way of dealing with the diffeomorphism group will be investigated that should be useful in many settings.  Indeed, in many problems across a wide swath of areas singularities occur.  Understanding them and the set where they form becomes a question of great importance.  When the objects sit inside some canonical space, one can use ``extrinsic'' reference points to make progress on important questions like these.  However, many key problems are defined intrinsically and there are no canonical reference points.  In those problems, the infinite dimensional diffeomorphism group (the gauge group) becomes a major issue and dealing with it, and understanding it, becomes a major obstacle.  Ricci flow is such an example.  The PI expects that the projects on MCF, Ricci flow and gauge groups will have implications to a number of other fields of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Comprehensive investigations of these fault systems are needed to understand past earthquake frequency and how these earthquakes affect fault evolution, providing crucial information to better prepare societies for future catastrophic events. This project focuses on reconstructing the earthquake history of a fault system located at the southern boundary of the North American Plate in Guatemala. The fault system is similar to the San Andreas Fault System in California, but its earthquake history remains poorly understood. By integration of geophysical methods and sedimentological investigations, this project will unravel the evolution of the fault system in time and space. The project will investigate the processes governing the frequency and location of earthquakes by examining sediments in five lakes near the fault system. In addition to the scientific outcomes, this project will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students by training them in geophysics and sedimentology through participation in an international research project, contributing towards a stronger geoscience workforce. The project will also reach a broad public audience through the development of geoscience class modules for elementary and middle school science classes and educational geoscience workshops for K-12 science teachers.<br/><br/>Despite continuous efforts to understand intracontinental strike-slip fault systems, several grand challenges related to the processes governing earthquake initiation, frequency, and location remain. Partly, these issues are related to the fact that historical records and instrumental measurements are insufficient to understand the long-term evolution and seismogenic behavior of fault systems, information that is paramount for seismic hazard evaluation. This project investigates the paleoseismic record preserved in five lakes in proximity to the Polochic-Motagua Fault System, the intracontinental strike-slip plate boundary fault system that separates the North American and Caribbean plates. This plate boundary setting is similar to that of the San Andreas and North Anatolian faults, but the earthquake record is largely unknown. Through seismic reflection data acquisition and characterization, and sedimentological interpretation of sediment cores, this project will contribute to the field of subaqueous quantitative paleoseismology and improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution of earthquakes along this strike-slip plate boundary. The project will involve two graduate and several undergraduate students, supporting geoscience workforce development through training of geophysical and sedimentological data acquisition, processing, and interpretation. The project will also reach out to a broader audience by involving K-12 students and teachers in several educational activities, by visiting science classrooms in Missouri, by developing teacher workshops for elementary and high school teachers, and by presenting and sharing research results during STEM days for elementary and middle school female students at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Epithelial tissues are the thin protective layers of cells that cover the inner and outer surfaces of organs. Throughout the body, one of the main functions of epithelial surfaces is lubrication. However, most of our understanding of epithelial lubrication comes from the study of fluids at epithelial surfaces, neglecting the mechanical behaviors of the cells themselves. This award supports fundamental research to establish the connection between epithelial lubrication and the mechanical behaviors of cells in monolayers. Pharmaceutical interventions are known to alter the mechanical properties of cells and tissues.  These will be used to uncover the underlying mechanical contributions to epithelial lubrication. This new knowledge will increase understanding of diseases of the epithelium and identify new potential therapies. Therefore, results from this research will ultimately benefit human health and society. This research brings together several disciplines including tribology (the study of friction and wear), cell mechanics, active matter physics, and physiology.  The convergence of multiple disciplines and the potential societal impacts of this work will aid in broadening participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in research and expand engineering education.  <br/><br/>The research aims to discover new principles of monolayer lubrication, guided by the central hypothesis that the mechanically relevant timescales associated with cell motion and intercellular fluid transport in monolayers generate multiple distinct regimes of lubrication. The rationale for this work is that new perspectives on epithelial tissue function and pathologies will emerge from rebuilding current understanding of epithelial lubrication on a foundation derived from collective cell motion and mechanics. The research team will classify and quantify collective motion in different types of monolayer, establish how cell motion and monolayer properties control indentation dynamics, and develop lubrication curves with connections to collective cell motion and monolayer material and transport properties.  Living analogs to classic lubrication phenomena like fluid ""squeeze films,"" poroelasticity, boundary lubrication, mixed lubrication, and hydrodynamic lubrication will be linked to collective cell motion, mechanics, and intercellular fluid transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The framework will consider the specific challenges of operating a large number of manufacturing processes at small scale, allowing to  use the process simulation not only as a means to evaluate the performance, but also to provide structural properties of the process being operated. This research fills an important gap in the black box optimization literature, which reportedly suffers from poor finite time performance, only exploit output of the simulation model and ignores sample path information, and, finally, faces important hurdles in scaling to solve high dimensional problems. The analytical infrastructure leverages and extends state-of-the-art techniques from Bayesian optimization, high dimensional statistics, and model predictive control. The project will devise methods to efficiently achieve satisfactory solutions to simulation based optimization in presence of discontinuities resulting from the dynamics of the system. Finite time performance of the algorithms will be studied, and high dimensional problems will be central to the development of the techniques. The performance of the techniques will be evaluated not only using synthetic state of the art black box optimization problems, but using large scale production of a large variety of bio-products in an individualized manufacturing set-up. With the idea to promote this new idea of manufacturing and the concepts of simulation-supported decision making, a game will be implemented to attract students, as well as, potentially, practitioners, to the area of manufacturing and operations research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, effective methods for testing complicated materials for structural defects or for identifying unknown targets in an efficient way with little a priori information are still in a state of infancy. This is particularly the case for material that exhibits directional properties, nonlinear interaction with interrogating waves, or peculiar geometric structures, all of which are present in contemporary applications in the above areas.  In this project, the investigator and her graduate students will develop entirely new techniques in inverse scattering theory that can handle the aforementioned imaging problems, in order to obtain reliable target signatures or usable information about objects being examined in computationally efficient ways. The goal is to minimize dependence on a priori information describing the physics and/or geometry of unknown targets as well as of mathematical and computational complications arising from the complexity of the hosting background. This study will combine practical applications with the mathematical elegance of new imaging techniques that have recently led to establishing a new field in mathematics called the qualitative approach or direct imaging techniques.<br/><br/>This research is a multifaceted effort to develop fast imaging methods of advanced and novel materials (including nonlinear materials) based on generalized linear sampling methods and spectral parameters related to non-scattering phenomena. There are three main projects:1) A Spectral Approach to Imaging with Waves: Motivated by the theory of transmission eigenvalues, this project proposes to develop a general framework for modifying the scattering operator in order to provide new eigenvalue problems associated with the scattering by an inhomogeneity. Particularly important is the determination of these (real or complex) eigenvalues from the scattering data, together with their relation to the material properties of the inhomogeneity. A major effort of the investigator is to apply this technique to image complex structures, including anisotropic/absorbing/dispersive media, thin layers, and meta-surfaces. 2) Interior Eigenvalues and Non-scattering Frequencies: A necessary condition for the non-scattering of a particular incident wave is that the wave number (or a specified parameter) is an eigenvalue of an interior eigenvalue problem defined on the support of the scatterer. On the other hand, the converse is true if at an eigenvalue the corresponding eigenfunction is extendable outside the support as a solution to the Helmholtz equation. Currently, only the case of scatterers with a corner is understood. The investigator states a more general conjecture and lays out a proposed approach to prove it. This project is theoretical in nature, but if successful, it would lead to a more general uniqueness result for the support of the scattering object with one incident wave. 3) Initiate the Development of the Qualitative Imaging Approach for Nonlinear Inhomogeneities. Despite the great interest and extensive research on the theory and computation of qualitative (direct) inversion methods, nothing has been done in connection with imaging media that exhibit nonlinear interaction with interrogating waves, which is the case for many contemporary engineered materials. This project aims to pioneer such a study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet little is known about the professional needs of paraeducators and how they can be supported in learning to teach mathematics in the early elementary grades. This project builds on exploratory work engaging in mathematics professional learning with paras to enact and study a professional learning experience with paraeducators focused on teaching and learning mathematics in grades PreK-3. This work will take place in over the course of two years in two different large urban school districts in different parts of the country. This model includes professional development experiences for paras and the teaches with which they work, support for teachers to improve their guidance for paras as they work together to support mathematics learning, professional learning support for school-based mathematics coordinators, and the study of the model's effectiveness through surveys, interviews, and classroom observations.<br/><br/>The project begins with the revision of the professional development model based on prior exploratory work, expanding the model to include aspects geared towards teacher and district-based support as well as strengthening the professional learning opportunities for paras. This phase of the project will develop measurement tools to assess the impact of the para and teacher learning, including the use of surveys to assess the practice and confidence of paras in implementing ambitious mathematics instruction, observation tools to measure para instructional behaviors, individual and focus group interviews to provide paras and their teacher mentors opportunities to describe their learning in depth, and analytical strategies related to the professional development artifacts. The second year will implement the model with 20 paras and their mentor teachers, along with 8 district-based mathematics facilitators. The second year of the project will engage an additional 20 new paras in each of the two districts involved with the project. The final year will focus on data analysis and the development of a generalizable model for para-teacher mentor professional development in mathematics. Dissemination of such a model is likely to have a meaningful impact on professional learning opportunities for this traditionally undersupported population and will support stronger mathematics outcomes for PreK-3 students.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

In this project, new experimental and computational methods will be developed that combine molecular biophysics with nanoscience to observe motions of proteins on timescales that were previously inaccessible to help decipher the role of molecular motion in protein function and the formation of protein-ligand and protein-protein complexes.    The experimental approaches will use site-specific relaxation properties measured by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) accompanied by molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. The project aims at a deeper understanding of these fundamental processes, which will assist the development of new cures and the engineering of proteins with new properties. This project provides interdisciplinary training and research opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs at Ohio State in programs that serve significant numbers of students from demographically underrepresented groups. The new National Gateway Ultrahigh Field NMR Center will offer opportunities to introduce a broader public to the discoveries and benefits of basic and applied molecular research. Title 1 high school students from the area will visit to perform and analyze NMR experiments of samples they synthesized in class. Conferences and workshops will be organized to train current and future NMR users from academia and industries in Ohio, the Midwestern region, and from across the nation. <br/><br/>The realistic representation of protein structure and dynamics at atomic detail is essential for understanding protein function. Protein dynamics can occur on a wide range of timescales covering femtoseconds to milliseconds and even beyond, but the timescale regime bridging nanosecond and microsecond dynamics has been notably difficult to access by experiments. Nanoparticle-assisted NMR spin relaxation (NASR) promises the accurate and comprehensive measurement of protein dynamics on nanosecond to microsecond timescales at atomic resolution. It will be developed and applied to a range of proteins with different biophysical properties and function both for the backbone and the side chains providing novel insights on protein dynamics behavior on these unchartered timescales. The new data, along with experimental database information, will also be used for the validation and systematic improvement of MD force fields, which underlie increasingly realistic high-performance computations for the in-silico prediction of protein properties and function, including protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, allostery, and biomolecular transport. New spectral sampling and automated analysis tools will be developed for the very rapid and routine measurement of widely used protein dynamics parameters, which will help elucidate the intricate relationship between protein structural dynamics and function for screening applications.

To address the critical need to expand developmental theories to incorporate underserved and underrepresented populations this project will train students from these understudied populations to become researchers who can provide rich and needed perspectives on developmental science. Through participation in the University of Texas at Dallas?s year-long REU, 30 students (10 per year) from historically underrepresented groups will learn the necessary tools to conduct high-quality research with real-world applications with families that are challenging-to-study, vulnerable, and underrepresented in the developmental science literature. Thus, the project will advance the field of developmental science by increasing diversity in both the researchers and the children who are researched.<br/><br/>Students will be drawn primarily from the Dallas/Ft Worth area, which compared to other similarly large cities in the U.S., has few research intensive 4-year institutions of higher learning, and few opportunities for students to gain high quality, first-hand research experiences. At least 50% of the students will be enrolled at one of Dallas College system?s 7 community campuses, and the remaining students will be enrolled at The University of Texas at Dallas .

With mentorship from UTD faculty, students will formulate new theoretically-driven research questions within ongoing data sets influenced by their Play With Me experience. In the spring, a faculty mentor team will guide students as they collect and analyze data from families recruited from Play With Me. In the summer, students will learn to disseminate findings to academic (journals, conferences) and non-academic (newsletters, community outreach) audiences.

For example, consider the task of estimating the lightness of an object (i.e., the fraction of light reflected by the object?s surface). Properties of the object (e.g., its color), will change the fraction of light it reflects and hence the amount of light available to the eyes.  However, the light available to the eyes also depends on several other aspects of the scene, such as the intensity of the light source and how background objects also reflect the light. Despite all this variation, the human visual system allows people to stably perceive an object?s lightness.  This project aims to identify the mental computations that lead to stable perception of object lightness. Lightness perception is just one example of a large variety of scene invariant perception problems that the human brain deals with and thus, an understanding of these mental computations could open the door to a better grasp of other brain functions as well. This interdisciplinary project will establish a color perception lab at an Historically Black College and University (HBCU), which will train students from under-represented communities in valuable job-oriented analytical, computational, and experimental skills that are in high demand in academia and industry.<br/><br/>To identify these computations, the investigator proposes to combine computational methods ? mathematical models that mimic the behavior of complex systems ? with experiments involving human participants to study how changes in scene properties affect people?s perception of lightness. Human participants will view computer-generated pictures of natural looking scenes using specifically calibrated equipment and will be asked to discriminate between two objects based on their lightness. For instance, a participant may see back-to-back images of the same scene and be asked to indicate in which of the two scenes a target object (e.g., a spherical object) is lighter.  The images will be generated using the investigator?s custom-built software pipeline; each image will be a two-dimensional rendering of a three-dimensional scene.  The software employed here can be used to generate large databases of images with precise control over the properties of the objects in the scene, such as the position and color of the objects, and the intensity and color of the light sources.  During the experiment, the investigator will vary the intensity of light sources and the color of the background objects and measure human participants? ability to distinguish the lightness of the target objects.  A computational model will then be created to compare with the performance of human observers.  The computational learning methods will be designed to perform the same task as the human participants.  If the model performs in a similar manner to the humans, it will suggest that the underlying mathematical computations of the model are similar to the mental computations of the human observers.  Taken together, the experiments and model will provide a rich description of how human beings perceive the lightness of objects under varying conditions and will provide insights into the possible biological mechanisms involved in stable lightness perception.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the aye-aye moves along the surface of a tree, it taps the wood with its unusual middle finger while keeping its nose near the tree?s surface and its large ears bent forward to detect deep cavities in tree bark that contains the worms they eat. This behavior is very similar to what is done in nondestructive evaluation (NDE), a process where an active acoustic wave is generated and the response from a material (e.g., echo) is used to characterize material properties as well as to detect and evaluate defects (e.g., cavities). The aye-aye?s tap-scanning behavior is unique, making it particularly valuable for creating new NDE technologies. The main goal of Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) research is to understand the exceptional near-field acoustic-based sensing and detection capabilities of aye-ayes, inspiring the creation of new NDE methods. This grant will help support research that will provide a foundation for developing bio-inspired NDE methods, both promoting science and ensuring the safety of our nation?s aging infrastructures. Reliable NDE methods are needed to inspect aging structures, such as bridges, pipelines, power plants, and aircrafts, as well as provide quality control assessments for complex manufactured components. Therefore, this research will benefit both the U.S. economy and promoting the safety of U.S. society by circumventing catastrophic failures of critical aging infrastructures. <br/><br/>The principal hypothesis of this research is that the exceptional near-field auditory system of aye-ayes has resulted from two marvelous adaptations: (i) shape and morphology of the aye-aye?s pinnae, ear canals, and head have adapted to enhance the noise reduction and reception of sound reflected from tapping and increase the near-field acoustic beam resolution and (ii) morphological features of the aye-aye?s middle finger have adapted to provide unique acoustic cues during tap-scanning. To test these hypotheses, the research team will perform bio-mimetic and numerical studies. First, a robotic platform will be used to mimic the aye-aye?s middle finger during tap-scanning. The effects of the pinna, head, and ear canal in enhancing the aye-aye?s acoustic near-field sensing will be evaluated experimentally. Second, finite element models will be used to numerically analyze the acoustic field of the aye-aye?s auditory system. Finally, a bio-inspired tap-scanner will be designed and manufactured to be used to inspect composite materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

HEAs have generated considerable interest as potential structural materials for use under harsh conditions due to their superior mechanical properties and chemical stability compared to traditional alloys. Despite all of the promise that HEAs hold, little is known about their surface structure and properties upon simultaneous mechanical impacts and chemical reactions under harsh environments. This collaborative research between Virginia Tech and the University of Alabama aims to develop a scientific understanding of the structure and formation mechanism of the surface of HEAs after simultaneous wear and rusting (i.e. tribocorrosion) in chloride-containing aqueous solution (e.g. seawater). By combining advanced surface characterization tools and multi-scale computer simulations, the link between surface defects,  deformation, and tribocorrosion susceptibility of HEAs will be established. This project will lead to the design of metals with high tribocorrosion resistance for critical applications which require high wear and rust resistance under harsh conditions. The highly cross-disciplinary research activities will provide graduate students with diverse training in materials science, tribology, corrosion, and computational materials science, as well as the collaborative teamwork experience. It will also positively impact several education and outreach initiatives, especially the involvement of underrepresented groups via research opportunities at Virginia Tech and the University of Alabama.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Our current understanding of the tribocorrosion mechanisms of HEAs is mainly challenged by a lack of understanding of the selective dissolution/oxidation of principal elements, as well as the new deformation physics at/below the surface. The synergy between mechanical and chemical attack drastically alters the materials? surface condition and corrosion susceptibility, especially for Cr-containing HEAs that rely on a thin yet protective surface oxide layer (i.e. passive layer) for corrosion protection in air and water. This project will combine advanced surface characterization and multi-scale simulations to reveal how frictional sliding-induced depassivation leads to the formation of far-from-equilibrium microstructure and composition at the surface, and the influence of the surface electrochemistry and mechancis that act synergistically on the overall repassivation kinetics and tribocorrosion rate. Specifically, the PIs will (1) determine how alloy concentration and grain size affect wear, corrosion, and their synergy, (2) elucidate the chemistry, composition, and defect characteristics of the tribocorroded surface structure and its formation mechanism, (3) understand wear-induced defect generation and microstructure evolution using atomistic simulations, and (4) develop an experimentally validated, predictive model for tribocorrosion using multiphysics simulations that incorporate rate-limiting corrosion and repassivation steps. The integrated experimental and computational approach has great potential to reduce the materials creation and deployment cycle to fabricate tribocorrosion-resistant alloys over a larger design space than traditionally known. Research opportunities and mentorship programs will be created at Virginia Tech and the University of Alabama for undergraduate students, especially for women (with both PIs serving as role models) and under-represented minorities. In addition, the proposed outreach activities will positively impact local K-12 students and the broad internet audience to promote their interest and enhance their knowledge in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This makes spin currents appealing for future low power technologies.  In most magnetic insulators, spin travels via waves, each carrying a certain amount of magnetism, but in some materials the spin is thought to be carried in more complicated ways, so that it comes in packets of different amounts or arranged differently in time, as if packets of magnetism are tied to each other.  The flow of spin can be driven and detected electrically using recently developed techniques. This project uses these methods to examine the flow of spin in several such materials as a function of temperature and other conditions, to try to test these ideas about non-wave-like spin motion.  For example, fluctuations in the flow of spin can quantify the amount of magnetism carried per packet, in the same way that the fluctuating sound of rain gives information about the size of rain drops. The Principal Investigator is working with leading theorists in the interpretation of the data.  Foundational knowledge of spin flow in these systems is essential for the full realization of their potential in future technologies, including quantum information processing.

Of particular interest is the propagation of spin through magnetic insulators, with the potential for ultralow dissipation in the absence of Ohmic charge flow.  Recent methods based on the spin Hall effect have enabled the measurement of spin transport in a variety of magnetically ordered systems via magnons, the quantized spin waves of the electrons in the lattice.  The intellectual merit of this project is the addressing of fundamental open questions, including:  How is spin transported in materials that host exotic emergent spin-carrying excitations rather than magnons?  Can spin transport be controlled through coupling to electric polarization in multiferroics?  What are the fundamental limitations of noise in spin transport?  Measurements will compare injection- and thermally-driven spin transport in classical spin liquids, a classical spin ice, a quantum spin ice, a candidate fermionic quantum spin liquid, and a multiferroic.  Noise techniques are used to observe and quantify spin shot noise, the predicted (but not yet observed) fundamental fluctuations in driven angular momentum transport due to the discrete nature of spin-carrying excitations. The Principal Investigator is working with leading theorist collaborators in the interpretation of the data.

Earth?s topography is also a primary observable of tectonic activity. For example, nearly every Earth science student learns to identify deep ocean trenches and adjacent mountain belts as the surface expression of active subduction, where one tectonic plate dives beneath another. It follows that we should, in principle, be able to use subduction zone topography (or that of any other active orogen) to understand the underlying geodynamic processes involved in its construction. While scientists have made great strides in this direction, recovering tectonic signals directly from topography remains a crucial challenge. This research will develop and apply new methods to narrow this knowledge gap through a case study of the Calabrian subduction zone in southern Italy. This study will clarify the role of topography as a recorder of subduction zone dynamics and improve understanding of the landscape response to geodynamic forcing by disentangling crustal, mantle, and earth surface contributions to topographic change. The new methods and results will be relevant for better understanding the context of earthquake hazards along these dynamic plate boundaries.

Conventional alloys are typically made of one or two primary alloying elements with addition of other low-concentration alloying elements to improve alloy properties.  Recently, high entropy alloys, also known as complex concentrated alloys, have received significant interest due to their novel structures and properties.  Unlike conventional alloys, high entropy alloys consist of five or more principal alloying elements in nearly equal concentrations.  These concentrated alloys exhibit outstanding physical properties compared to conventional alloys including high-temperature strength, corrosion resistance, and radiation tolerance, though the reasons why are poorly understood to date.  This project investigates the fundamental mechanisms of high temperature oxidation in high entropy alloys and establishes the roles of chemistry and microstructure in controlling oxidation behavior.  Through this project a diverse group of students and scientists, including women and students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, will be trained to test, characterize, model and predict the oxidation behavior of high entropy alloys using computational and experimental tools.  This project will advance our goals towards developing materials with improved oxidation resistance which will contribute towards more fuel efficient and longer lasting power plants, improved jet and rocket engines, and safer nuclear power plants.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>High entropy alloys (HEAs) and the related complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) are garnering increased attention from the researchers worldwide searching for alternatives to conventional/legacy materials. Oxidation limits the application of many advanced materials in high temperature environments and there have been very few investigations of the oxidation behavior of high entropy alloys.  Most of those studies centered on as-fabricated (e.g., as-cast, as-sintered, etc.) alloys without addressing the influences of microstructural parameters (i.e., grain/phase size, morphology, or distribution). This research will use a coupled experimental and computational approach to establish how oxidation occurs in AlCoCrFeNi HEAs/CCAs and will provide a framework that can be used to design and fabricate HEAs/CCAs exhibiting enhanced oxidation resistance. This research will use CALPHAD based thermodynamic modeling to predict phase equilibria and oxidation products and will use TC-PRISMA complemented with DICTRA to simulate phase precipitation due to oxidation.  The simulated microstructures and phases will be validated using cross-correlative analytical electron microscopy and Atom Probe Tomography techniques to quantify solute segregation behavior and the influences of phase distribution and grain boundary character on oxidation.

The fascinating hydrodynamics of He II has many important applications. For instance, it supports an extremely efficient heat-transport mode called thermal counterflow and therefore has been widely utilized as a coolant material in scientific instruments. When stirred, He II can also create vortex tubes which are essentially tiny tornadoes with thin hollow cores. Understanding the dynamics of a tangle of vortex tubes can benefit the study of various physical systems such as neutron stars that consist of neutron-pair superfluid. In this project, the research team aims to explore some predicted anomalous behaviors in counterflow turbulence and to visualize the vortex tubes in He II using advanced three-dimensional flow visualization techniques. This research can produce fundamental knowledge indispensable for better applications of He II. The research team consists of both postdoctoral researchers and graduate students. Through the project, the team members are expected to gain valuable knowledge in fluid dynamics, cryogenics, and laser technologies. The skills they learn through the research training are also crucial for their success in today's job market. In addition, the research team plans to conduct educational demonstrations involving cryogenic fluids in various outreach programs at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The PI is also committed to serve the research community by organizing workshop and conferences to engage junior researchers. <br/> <br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The current research work consists of: 1) a stereoscopic molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) study of the anomalous anisotropy in He II counterflow turbulence, and 2) an exploration of the vortex tangle dynamics using a scanning particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) method. The stereoscopic MTV system, which incorporates a unique double-line optical setup, is developed as the first-of-its-kind equipment in quantum turbulence research. It offers the capability of making unambiguous measurements of the normal-fluid velocity field and its spatial correlations in the coupled two-fluid system, which breaks the ground for solving various challenging problems. The study of the anomalous anisotropy in He II counterflow turbulence is expected to produce experimental data that are critical for the development of a complete theoretical understanding of this complex doubly turbulent system. Such an understanding not only advances the knowledge of turbulence in general but also aids the cryogenic engineers in designing more efficient He II based cooling systems. The scanning PTV system to be developed enables real-time imaging of quantized vortex tangles in three-dimensional space, which offers a great opportunity for vortex research that is not possible otherwise. The planned research on exploring the vortex-reconnection scaling, vortex-velocity correlations, and vortex trajectory statistics should produce important new knowledge needed for the development of an advanced statistical model of quantum turbulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental Langlands Functoriality Conjectures predict subtle relations between different spaces of automorphic forms, a structure that is closely related to many questions in number theory and analysis.  This research project focuses on establishing properties of automorphic forms and new connections between different spaces of automorphic forms.  The project will also support a graduate student and allow the PI and his students to disseminate the work through conferences and seminars.<br/><br/>This project treats automorphic forms and representations on reductive groups and on their metaplectic covers of arbitrary degree. Automorphic forms on reductive groups are the key ingredients of the Langlands Program, and automorphic forms on covers are closely tied to reciprocity laws and related to the congruence subgroup problem. The research focuses on correspondences and on L-functions. In one series of projects, the principal investigator will develop and study new theta correspondences that generalize the classical theta correspondence but involve the tensor product of two small representations.  A second project seeks to give a new Shimura correspondence that is detected by a period involving a theta function on an orthogonal group. This will be established by means of a new relative trace formula. A third set of projects concerns the systematic development of integral representations for L-functions which make use of the residual spectrum. These projects will advance our knowledge of automorphic forms, both on reductive groups and on finite degree covers, our understanding of small automorphic representations, and our understanding of the relations between automorphic forms on different groups.

Rapid advances in sequencing and imaging technologies are making it possible to profile these differences for hundreds to thousands of genes in hundreds to thousands of individual cells and small groups of cells in a spatially resolved manner. However, statistical methods and computational tools are still needed to model and analyze these high-dimensional spatially resolved measurements in order to extract relevant biological insights. This project will develop statistical approaches for analyzing these spatially resolved transcriptomics datasets in order to characterize spatial gene expression patterns and associate them with underlying cellular phenotypes and functions, particularly within tissues. Such characterization will help provide insights into how spatial context and organization may impact cellular phenotype and function. The developed approaches will also be made available to the scientific community as open-source software and be applicable to other biological contexts. Finally, instructional material including case study tutorials developed through this project will be used in a hands-on-learning course to engage young girls in computer science. <br/><br/>On a technical level, to analyze spatially resolved transcriptomics data of tissues, this project will use a density agnostic encoding of spatial positional information using Voronoi tessellation to accommodate variations in cell density common to tissues. Spatial autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses will be used to identify genes with significant spatial patterns that may further be indicative of cell-cell communication. Convolutional neural network-based approaches will be applied to integrate the subcellular spatial organization of mRNAs in cell segmentation within tissues and be combined with previous RNA velocity models in order to infer temporal dynamics and delineate potential cellular migration within tissues. To interrogate how gene expression variation may be associated with cellular phenotype, neural networks will also be applied to predict molecular features directly from histological staining images of tissues.

Catalysis is a technology of prime importance and has deep implications in many fields, ranging from synthetic chemistry to the production and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, fine and commodity materials, as well as new well-defined materials. Indeed, it is estimated that 85% of all products made involve catalysis at some point in their production. Most work on the development of new catalytic systems focus on aspects related to efficiency and selectivity. The notion of spatial and temporal control has been largely under-studied and remains elusive. Of all possible stimuli to achieve control, light is the most attractive since it is noninvasive, it can be easily manipulated thanks to modern optics techniques. NIR light is particularly suitable as it can penetrate materials and induce reactions through barriers. This can be attractive to the plastics industry, as it allows the shaping of highly controllable yet robust materials through molds. The project will establish the use of NIR light to control polymerizations through material barriers with an eye towards achieving new technological breakthroughs to enable, enhance, and drive plastics and material science. The project will also create the opportunity to synthesize a set of industrially recyclable, environmentally benign polymers from which the monomer can be regenerated and reused. Additionally, educational opportunities will be provided for underrepresented students, from elementary school students to undergraduates, to broaden interest and educate them in photochemistry and polymerization.  <br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Tomislav Rovis of Columbia University is studying the use of near-infrared (NIR) light to activate various catalysts to effect catalyzed polymerizations through barriers.

Inherent to the approach is the propensity of low-energy NIR light to penetrate material barriers such as silicone, paper, plastic and even tissue. The project aims to take maximum advantage of the energy of NIR light to induce chemical change at the catalyst of interest. This research has he potential to greatly enhance fundamental understanding of the mechanism of NIR-initiated olefin metathesis. Extensions of this work will include orthogonal light and heat polymerization and depolymerization along with in situ studies for bioimaging. With this approach, the project will also extend into other NIR-controlled polymerizations, including N-heterocyclic carbene activation to induce polymerization en route to polyurethanes and polyesters, two crucial families of organic materials.

New algorithms for the problems considered would be of direct interest to many disciplines in science and engineering.  The project includes a research workshop targeted at junior researchers, as well as a video tutorial course by the team of investigators on contemporary techniques in optimization.

Recent progress on discrete optimization has relied heavily on inspiration and analysis from continuous methods, while the solution of continuous optimization problems often uses graph theory.  It is anticipated that new techniques bridging this spectrum, and of broad, general applicability, will be developed.

The defining characteristics of the Earth, such as oceans, continents, life, and plate tectonics are likely to have appeared for the first time on the Hadean eon. It thus seems inevitable that their emergence would have been affected by these early collisions, though to what extent they were affected remains an open question. In particular, little understood are the effects of these collisions on the internal evolution of the Earth.  Collisions are thought to have contributed significantly to the abundance of highly iron-loving elements (e.g., Au, Ir, Ru) in the Earth?s mantle, but the details of their delivery through impacts are not fully understood due to complex mixing processes that arise when a projectile collides with the early Earth. In addition, it is not well-understood how the long-term evolution of the Earth?s mantle could have responded to the injection of materials derived from the impactors. This project introduces an innovative computational approach that combines impact simulations with models that explore the long-term evolution of the Earth?s interior to quantify the delivery of highly iron-loving elements, their distribution in the mantle, and the total mass of late accreted materials. These results allow for an increased understanding of the Hadean Earth surface environment. Moreover, the connections between short-term impact dynamics and long-term mantle dynamics may shed light on the origin of anomalies in the mantle (such as the large low-shear-velocity provinces, which are the most significant anomalies on the deep mantle), the dynamics of mantle plumes, and the history of the geomagnetic field. This project also provides support for interdisciplinary training of a graduate student, an undergraduate internship where the Southwest Research Institute will host 1-2 geophysics major from Yale University, and a series of movies that visualize planetesimal impacts and mantle dynamics for education outreach.<br/><br/>The geophysical evolution of Hadean Earth was controlled by large-scale collisions and mantle dynamics, but the interplay of these processes remains largely unexplored. The Earth?s protracted bombardment of leftover planetesimals after the Moon-forming giant impact, called ?late accretion?, is supported by the lunar cratering record and is required to explain the abundance of as well as the chondritic proportions of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the present-day mantle. Recently, based on impact simulations with smooth-particle hydrodynamics (SPH), the late accreted mass has been suggested to be two to five times higher than previously thought, because the metallic cores of large differentiated planetesimals, where the bulk of HSEs reside, are not efficiently mixed into the mantle. Such an upward revision of late accreted mass could dramatically modify our understanding of the Hadean Earth. This suggestion based on SPH simulations is, however, still provisional because important complications arising from long-term mantle dynamics are not incorporated. Thus, the delivery of HSEs, their distribution in the mantle, and the total mass of the late accretion are still wide-open questions, with important consequences on the Hadean Earth surface environment. This project aims to achieve the following two major objectives: (1) to quantify the fate of differentiated planetesimal cores during impacts, by re-evaluating SPH simulations including the physics of fragmentation, and (2) to understand the long-term fate of fragmented metallic blobs by conducting systematic mantle mixing simulations. The primary goal of this project is to determine the absolute scale of planetesimal impact history, but achieving this goal will also help to address a wide range of important questions, from the habitability of the early Earth to the origin of deep geochemical reservoirs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Making buildings more energy efficient is a goal of the high-performance building technology industry.  Achieving this goal requires hiring more building performance technicians, but the demand for these technicians outstrips the supply.  Building performance technical work includes all aspects of facility operations and maintenance, including whole-system analysis and energy management. Thus, success in the building technology workforce requires the knowledge and skills needed to install, implement, and maintain complex building systems.  This project intends to increase the pipeline of highly skilled building performance technicians by creating a new stackable certificate program, offering dual enrollment courses for high school students, providing training for high school teachers, and conducting outreach activities. By expanding career pathways into the building performance workforce, the project aims to broaden participation of women and other groups that are underrepresented in the building technology workforce and that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>This project will address a significant and growing demand for entry-level high performance building technicians in Southwest Ohio. The overall goal of the project is to expand the pipeline of skilled technicians who have the skills to reduce energy consumption in buildings. To this end, the project will develop a stackable short-term certificate with embedded industry-recognized credentials.  Students who earn this credential will be prepared to take industry certification exams and enter the building performance workforce. Specific aims of the project include to: (1) create a new postsecondary certificate program that can be completed by high school students; (2) train high school teachers to deliver postsecondary course content; (3) pilot an outreach program to raise awareness of technical career opportunities among youth, particularly from communities not equitably represented in the building technician workforce; (4) provide a structured approach to guide high school students and unemployed/ underemployed adults onto building performance career pathways; and (5) improve student learning by upgrading labs with the latest building technologies. Using student surveys, student interviews, and institutional data, the project will assess the impact of the certificate program on student learning and the impact of outreach activities on recruiting students from communities that are underrepresented in the technical workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some chemical components that enter into subduction zones are released back to the oceans (as water or gas); others contribute to magmas in volcanoes (where they become part of the crust as igneous rocks or are released to the atmosphere as volcanic gases) and still others are transported all the way into the deep interior of the Earth. Understanding how elements and compounds are divided between the surface and the interior of Earth can provide important information about the regulation of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, the concentration of radioactive elements near the surface of the Earth, and the tendency of some volcanoes to erupt violently. This project uses the element boron, which is highly concentrated in seawater and ocean sediments compared to the interior of the Earth, to track the recycling of surface components through subduction zones. If we can measure the amount of boron entering into a subduction zone on the sea floor and how much boron is released by associated volcanoes and into the ocean, then we can calculate how much boron is recycled into the deep Earth. The workplan includes opportunities for intellectual exchange between collaborators in the United States, Italy, and Japan. Students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels will participate in and benefit from the collaborative exchange.<br/><br/>Subduction zones are the primary locus for recycling of crustal materials into the Earth?s mantle, with important implications for mantle and continental crustal evolution throughout Earth history. Subducted sediments in particular contribute volatiles, trace elements, and unique isotopic signatures to the oceans, the mantle, and arc magmas. Boron is both highly fluid mobile and isotopically fractionated during thermally-driven desorption and metamorphic dehydration, making it an excellent tracer for both sediment and fluids. In contrast, Rare Earth Elements (HREE) and High Field Strength Elements (HFSE) are generally immobile, making them good tracers of sediment and basalt provenance. By observing the co-variation of B, d11B, and HREE/HFSE concentrations in progressively dehydrated marine clays and subsidiary basalts within a unique sample suite from the Nankai margin, we propose to constrain 1) the initial variability in slab inputs to the trench within a well-constrained segment of a single subduction zone; and 2) the evolution of sediment and released fluid composition through progressive desorption and dehydration prior to entering the sub-arc region.

Search engines that allow users to find answers to pretty much all of their questions are expected to deliver results in less than a second, while understanding the customer with a high probability based on just a few words of input. This is not the type of computation that is precise and gives the ?correct? answer; it instead provides solutions that are more associative, mimicking the human way of addressing problems. In fact, many problems in the real world are probabilistic in nature, and conventional computing schemes are not optimized for these tasks. In 1982 Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman stated in recognition of this fact: ?The way to simulate a probabilistic nature might still be by a computer which itself is probabilistic... So, it becomes what I?ll call a probabilistic computer, in which the output is not a unique function of the input.? To promote the progress of science, this proposal aims to explore, model and build hardware components and circuits that ultimately enable such a probabilistic computer, which will greatly benefit the society as a whole. Moreover, educational tools, new courses and training opportunities both for undergraduate and graduate students are being created that expose them to a device-to-systems research program on probabilistic computing in order to prepare them for the new era of electronics.<br/><br/>The project adopts a Device-to-Systems approach that covers experiments from single devices and small circuits all the way up to simulations with thousands of devices. It addresses the question of how to implement probabilistic functionality in hardware from a variety of different angles. The key objective of this proposal is to take the next step in the development of probabilistic computing by experimental demonstrations of integrated probabilistic bits (p-bits) and p-circuits and quantifying advantages of scaled probabilistic computers through key figures-of-merits in system-level applications based on experimental input. This is being achieved by employing unstable magnets in a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) configuration as random number generators that become tunable by the use of field-effect transistors in a suitable circuit layout. Initial projections estimate that if integrated MTJs coupled with conventional transistors can be scaled up, one can expect to achieve orders of magnitude improvements compared to what is achievable in conventional semiconductor technology in key figures-of-merits, such as the number of statistically independent samples per second (also referred to as flips per second) that a probabilistic sampler can go through.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first models of this kind, so-called free boundary problems, were proposed as early as 1831 and became ubiquitous across science and engineering in the second half of the 20th century. Despite the considerable attention devoted to free boundary problems, the understanding of the solutions they generate is still very limited. In this project, the investigator will use a novel approach on free boundary problems, grounded in modern probability theory to advance the understanding of this important class of mathematical models. A particular focus of the project will be on the desirable irregularities present in these models capturing, for example, the rapid growth of a crystal or neural synchronization, as well as the non-smooth nature of the surface of a tumor or between the components of an alloy. Integral parts of the project are supervision of graduate and undergraduate research, and graduate and undergraduate training in probability theory and stochastic analysis.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems provide a universal mathematical framework for many phenomena in the natural and social sciences as well as engineering. While the mathematical formulation of free boundary problems dates back to the 19th century and their analysis has received much attention in the 20th century, the understanding of their solutions is still limited. This is largely due to the singularities oftentimes exhibited by the solutions, either in time, capturing for example the rapid growth of a crystal or neural synchronization, or in space, encapsulating for example the non-smooth nature of the surface of a tumor or between the components of an alloy. This project builds on the analysis for the one phase supercooled Stefan problem in one space dimension, a prototypical example of a singular free boundary problem. The aim is to expand the scope of the novel probabilistic solution concept they introduced to include a large set of singular free boundary problems, such as the one phase supercooled Stefan problem for the nonlinear heat equation and its two-phase analogue in one space dimension, the supercooled Stefan problem in multiple space dimensions, possibly with kinetic undercooling and/or surface tension, and the Hele-Shaw problem in multiple space dimensions. In addition, the investigator intends to identify these solutions with large scale limits of random growth models defined by means of interacting particle systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research component is intertwined with teaching and outreach components, with initiatives including the development of courses discussing diverse methods used to investigate scientific practice (e.g., from philosophy, history, sociology, science of science), a national workshop for members of underrepresented/marginalized groups intending to pursue research in the science of science, and innovative K-12 STEM programming which demonstrates the importance of diversity in action.<br/><br/>This project employs tools from evolutionary game theory and network science to provide a picture of how aspects of social identity, e.g. race and gender, matter both to scientific progress and to how researchers scientifically investigate the institution of science. These tools, which capture the dynamics of scientists' interactions and the structure of scientific communities, enable the project to integrate insights from feminist philosophy of science with insights from science of science, to the benefit of both fields. Many theories in the science of science take for granted that there are the same credit incentives, chances of work being published and cited, etc. for all scientists, regardless of social identity. Yet, as has long been recognized within feminist philosophy of science, these considerations matter: researchers are excluded or marginalized according to social identity, and scientific progress is hampered by the resulting lack of diverse ideas and perspectives. This project reveals how our understanding of how to achieve well-functioning science can change drastically once social identity is taken into account. Meanwhile, the scientific tools used in this project have clear power to illuminate questions of interest to feminist philosophers of science, e.g. how communication networks within scientific communities influence knowledge generation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to characterize cellular changes accompanying biofilm formation at the systems level, as well as the role of a particular family of sensor proteins in biofilm formation/dissolution at the molecular level. Student training is a major emphasis of this work.

A proteomics workshop for graduate students will also be developed to train the next generation of scientists in this cutting-edge technology. <br/><br/>The scientific objective is to define conserved and novel mechanisms of bacterial signaling relevant to biofilm formation across multiple species using advanced structural and proteomics methods. At the molecular level, this will include determining the mechanisms by which the heme nitric oxide/oxygen binding proteins (H-NOX) sense oxidants and/or nitric oxide (NO), resulting in biofilm formation or dissolution. Structure determination using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) will be utilized as well as X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS).

With this award, the College will establish the Technician Education Readiness Pathway to meet the critical need for a skilled technical workforce.  Nearly all students entering American Samoa Community College require remediation in mathematics and reading, which bars them from enrolling in the existing Technician Education programs.  Currently, less than 5% of high school teachers are rated as ?highly qualified? in these subject areas.  The Technician Education Readiness Pathway will adopt the STEM Guitar Building curriculum to enhance education in applied math, as well as technical reading and writing.  This curriculum builds on the strong cultural connection that music plays in everyday life in American Samoa, thus providing additional motivation for students and teachers in the technician education pathway.  <br/><br/>The goals of the project are to (1) improve student knowledge in STEM concepts, (2) increase the number of students eligible to enroll in Technician Education programs, and (3) prepare students for industry recognized certification exams.  The Technician Education Readiness Pathway will establish a partnership between the STEM faculty of American Samoa Community College and teachers from Nu?uli Vocational Technical High School.  The partnership will provide professional development for 20 educators on the Guitar Building curriculum, which will include training in AutoCAD and a laser cutting system.  The trained faculty and teachers will then work with at least 100 students over three years to integrate STEM learning with guitar building as they prepare to enroll in the Technician Education programs.  Students that enter without the need for remedial coursework will be able to quickly earn a STEM certificate or degree, making them eligible for employment in the STEM workforce.  American Samoa Community College will establish an advisory board that includes the American Samoa Power authority to gain industry feedback, and the Oceania Community Development Network to broadly disseminate the program?s successes.

Recent recognition that higher-dimensional quantum states known as qudits have many potential advantages towards quantum information processing has generated much focus on this topic. These pertain to areas such as quantum simulation, quantum communications, fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, and improved quantum error correction. This project uses two-dimensional metal chalcogenides? unique band structures comprising multiple valleys to realize high-dimensional quantum qudit states based on multiple flavor degrees of freedom. These materials have a predicted flavor SU(3) symmetry, of particular interest because of the analogy to the quark model in particle physics, and this symmetry is extremely rare in condensed matter systems. The project experimentally tests predictions for novel tunable Kondo effects and Coulomb blockade behavior emerging from this symmetry. The project also performs experiments aimed at manipulating these flavor states to develop qudits towards quantum information processing based on flavortronics. These research activities are coupled with a parallel theoretical effort that informs the experimental one, leading to a synergistic effort aimed at the development of high-dimensional quantum states based on beyond-graphene two-dimensional materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whereas these simulators may be able to generate realistic synthetic data, they are often poorly suited for the inverse problem of inferring the underlying scientific mechanisms associated with observed real-world phenomena. Hence, a recent trend in the sciences has been to fit approximate models to high-fidelity simulators, and then use these approximate models for scientific inference. Inevitably, any downstream analysis will depend on the trustworthiness of the approximate model, the data collected, as well as the design of the simulations. This project will advance statistical methods for understanding complex physical systems by providing improved procedures and new performance measures for simulator-based scientific inference and uncertainty quantification. Our work will stimulate the development of data-focused collaborations, and training of students across a wide range of scientific areas, further expanding upon our ongoing interdisciplinary research efforts in high-energy physics, atmospheric science, climatology, and astronomy.<br/><br/>Parameter estimation, confidence sets, and hypothesis testing are the hallmarks of statistical inference. Traditional methods to perform such tasks can sometimes not be applied to problems in the physical sciences because of (i) complex data settings, and (ii) the only meaningful model existing as a high-fidelity forward simulator. For example, in high-energy physics, searches of new interactions and particles require hypothesis tests involving simulations of high-dimensional collision events and their interactions with particle detectors; in cosmology, scientists regularly use large N-body simulations to understand how the Universe formed and evolved; and in atmospheric science, inferring land-air carbon fluxes based on satellite observations relies on complex atmospheric transport models. A key question is whether one can still construct hypothesis tests and confidence sets with proper frequentist coverage and high power when the likelihood function, which connects underlying parameters with observable data, is intractable but one can forward-simulate observable data from an implicit likelihood model. A related question is how to calibrate and assess the performance of surrogate models fit to high-fidelity simulations. This project works toward designing statistical procedures that unify classical statistics with modern machine learning (e.g., deep generative models, neural network classifiers and convex optimization) via the following aims: (1) Scalable tools and theory for constructing statistical tests and frequentist confidence sets with finite-sample validity in a simulator-based inference setting; (2) Statistically rigorous validation methods, which can quantify and diagnose the quality of fitted models of high-dimensional data with statistical confidence across both feature and parameter space; and (3) Sequential testing strategies that allow us to identify how to best simulate data to improve tests and confidence sets in Aim 1.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will investigate a new combustion concept using supercritical fluids. It will advance and provide new knowledge pertaining to the applications of supercritical spray in combustion engines. The successful adoption of the proposed techniques can dramatically reduce the fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, benefiting the environment and energy security. Additionally, this project will provide an excellent opportunity for integrating research and education. Graduate and undergraduate students, particularly from underrepresented and diversified groups, will be involved in the research.

The results can also be used to serve the engineering community and to motivate the younger generation (K-12 students) to pursue STEM majors in the future.<br/><br/>The hypothesis of this proposal is that supercritical spray combustion has significantly different mixing, ignition, combustion, and pollutant formation processes from conventional spray combustion and understanding the fundamentals can help achieve clean and efficient fuel combustion suitable for many emerging applications. The objective of this research is to experimentally demonstrate supercritical fuel combustion and quantify its impact on air-fuel mixing, ignition, combustion, and the production of pollutant emissions. Supercritical spray combustion is a novel area that has not been well studied despite potential applications in next-generation compression-ignition engines and other combustion devices. Besides fundamental understanding of supercritical spray penetration, mixing, combustion, and pollutant formation, this study will have significant impact on the performance of future diesel engines.

Rates of greenhouse gas release from these wetlands may increase with warming and offset their ability to sequester carbon. By studying the chemical and microbiological processes in wetland sediments over space and time, predictions of the effects of climate change on these critical habitats will be possible. Documentation of the ecological importance of this region via photography will demonstrate the value of wetlands to a broad audience.<br/><br/>The drivers of biogeochemical activity that dictate the emissions of carbon dioxide and methane in small, inland waters are poorly constrained, yet processes in these water bodies play an oversized role in understanding climate change. One process that is poorly understood is the role of chemical reactions in mediating carbon dioxide and methane formation in small lakes and wetlands, especially the abiotic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the sediment-water interface (SWI). The hypothesis for this project is that the reaction of reduced soluble and particulate forms of iron, sulfur, and carbon with trace level oxygen to form ROS at the SWI is an under-appreciated, yet critical, control on microbiological activity and the cycling of carbon in small inland water bodies. Using a combination of field work in the prairie pothole region of North Dakota, controlled laboratory experiments, and mesocosm studies, this work will 1) identify the geochemical drivers of ROS generation at the SWI, 2) determine spatiotemporal patterns of linked pore water chemistry and ROS at the SWI, and 3) track the generation of specific labile carbon substrates produced through ROS-DOM reactions that affect rates of carbon mineralization and methane production in small lake and wetland sediments. A combination of in situ voltammetry measurements, detailed characterization of dissolved and particulate organic matter, iron, and sulfur species, and microbial -omics analyses will be used to understand the coupled biogeochemical processes. A key component of this work is understanding how abiotic ROS driven reactions at the sediment-water interface lead to turnover of terminal electron acceptors and generation of labile microbial substrates. Establishing a baseline understanding of these processes is needed to predict changes in carbon dioxide and methane fluxes under different climate scenarios. The collected data will enable understanding of how biogeochemical cycles are maintained through coupled abiotic/biotic pathways, and how these processes impact carbon cycling in aquatic environments. This approach is also applicable to other systems and the cycling of other elements, such as nitrogen, which may be especially important in urban wetland regions. The societal benefit will be improved understanding of processes that influence, and are influenced by, climate change. To reach as broad an audience as possible regarding the importance of this region, a photographer will document the landscape and its ecological function during field sampling trips.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project lies at the interface of organic and photophysical chemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels.  This group is also well-positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.  Outreach activities with middle school students that promote interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and foster trust in scientists and science will also be part of the funded project.<br/><br/>Photo-acids and photo-bases are molecules whose acidity changes reversibly upon absorption of light.  This can result in excited-state proton transfer, with energetics described using the well-known Förster cycle analysis.  Recently, Professor Shane Ardo and his group showed that many photo-acids and photo-bases that do not undergo excited state proton transfer due to kinetic limitations can be re-engineered to overcome this barrier through the introduction of proton acceptor and/or proton donor buffer species.  This allowed the research team to accurately predict excited state acidity, and thus standard state driving force, for proton transfer.  In this project, they aim to validate their new method and then use it to quantify the relationship between standard-state driving force and activation free energy for proton-transfer reactions, including in the Marcus inverted region.  They also aim to leverage this fundamental understanding to design and demonstrate photochemical protonic energy conversion systems that use light to modulate the protonation state of two buffer species.  They attempt to answer the following critical questions: 1) Are driving-force-dependent theories for the kinetics of electron transfer and proton transfer, e.g. Rehm?Weller, Marcus?Cohen, Agmon?Levine, suitable to describe excited-state proton transfer reactions?  2) Can the ground-state acidity/basicity of photo-acids/photo-bases be tuned so that buffers and/or protic solvents serve as proton donors/acceptors for regeneration of the ground-state conjugate base/acid of photo-acids/photo-bases?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Glucose monitoring remains an isolated success because glucose sensors are based on enzymes which can be challenging to develop for analytes other than metabolites (e.g. glucose, lactate, ethanol).  An alternate class of sensors called electrochemical aptamer sensors are simpler to develop for analytes beyond glucose (hormones, drugs, proteins), but aptamer sensors have not yet demonstrated the longevity of use required for most medical applications and often have limits in their sensitivity.  These longevity and sensitivity challenges, at least in part, exist because a perfect layer of aptamer must be assembled and retained on an electrode surface.  This project will demonstrate and explore the physics of a new sensor approach based on solution-phase electrochemical aptamer sensors. Simply, the aptamers are allowed to float freely in solution, and when an analyte binds with an aptamer the aptamer changes in shape in a way that is measurable by an electrode.  Solution-phase electrochemical aptamer sensors will provide significant advantages in terms of (1) breakthrough longevity and robustness due to their simplicity, and (2) improved sensitivity due to their highly tunable physics.  This project aligns with the goal of enabling personalized medicine, by creating a new approach for biosensors that allow continuous biosensing of hormones, peptides, therapeutic drugs, and other markers across human health and medicine. <br/><br/>Building upon preliminary work, this project pursues two specific aims.  Aim 1 - demonstrate the underlying physics of solution-phase electrochemical aptamer sensors using existing aptamer designs developed for optically measured aptamers. The rationale for pursuing this aim is that leveraging fully characterized and modeled aptamers will allow a rapid theoretical understanding of new experimental data in this project.  The product of this aim will be at least one aptamer that can then be redesigned in Aim 2.  Aim 2 - create a rationale toolset for modifying aptamer design for achieving maximum changes in electrochemical signal.  By demonstrating this fundamental design toolset before pursuing application-specific work, this second aim will enable all researchers to more rapidly advance a new field of solution-phase electrochemical aptamer sensors.    The product of this aim will be both new knowledge of the physics of solution-phase electrochemical aptamer sensors, and a launch-pad for follow-on work in both fundamental and applied proposals to create continuous biosensors that can be worn on the body or implanted in the body.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(2) To develop a collection of exemplar tasks and rich records of practice for each task. These records of practice will detail the mathematical and real-world learning goals, background knowledge needed for both goals, common student responses, and videos or vignettes of the task in progress. A team of six teachers at two sites will be recruited to collaborate with the team throughout the project. Teachers will provide input and feedback on the design of, appropriateness of, and relevance of the tasks and the support materials needed to implement the real-world tasks. Initial tasks will be field tested with elementary students and additional tasks will be developed for subsequent week-long summer camps and for teaching in elementary classrooms. (3) To research both the development and enactment of these tasks.

The project aims to exploit suitable notions of entropy to study global features of mean curvature flow and minimal hypersurfaces. Significant educational activities that are integrated into the project include: mentoring undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs on some questions in the project; recruiting women and other underrepresented groups; teaching mini-courses to attract young students to the field; and organizing seminars, workshops and research programs promoting young scholars.<br/><br/>The project has three parts. The first concerns quantitative understanding of resolutions of conical singularities of mean curvature flow and its application to the higher homotopy group of the space of closed hypersurfaces in Euclidean space of low entropy. The second is to develop a Morse theory for self-expanding solutions to mean curvature flow. The last is to study geometric and topological properties of minimal hypersurfaces in sphere and hyperbolic space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In bacteria, environmental stress can cause the production of proteins that alter metabolism, the production and maintenance of cellular components, growth, and survivability. A class of proteins comprising this physiological response to stress in bacteria includes toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. These TA systems are produced, activated, and inactivated in the bacterial cell to control the toxin activity and modify the cellular response to stress. TA systems have also been implicated in biofilm formation, colonization, virulence, and antibiotic tolerance with implications in environment and health. However, our understanding of how TA systems are regulated is limited. Overcoming this barrier would allow for the development of new strategies to control TA system activity, thereby targeting the TA-related functions, such as tolerance to antibiotics or biofilm development. This work will utilize an integrated genetic, structural, biochemical and biophysical approach to study these important biological regulatory systems. A second outcome of this work will be a detailed understanding of how proteins, including degradative enzymes, destroy TA system components. More broadly, this project will support the training of students in this advanced, multidisciplinary field, and prepare them for a future career at the forefront of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>The model TA system of MqsRA includes the ribonuclease toxin, MqsR, and its cognate antitoxin, MqsA. MqsR activation leads to cleavage of messenger RNAs at specific sequence sites. Acting as a regulatory switch, TA system activity is elicited by proteolysis of the inhibitory antitoxin, thus altering the antitoxin-toxin ratio and allowing the free toxin to become active. These studies will elucidate the recognition determinants for degradation of MqsA by two cellular proteases that enable MqsR activation. Further, this work will determine the mechanism of protease-regulated activation of toxin in live cells and evaluate roles of key stress-induced chaperones in modifying MqsA susceptibility. This approach will incorporate multidisciplinary strategies and techniques to discover the biochemical, molecular, and cellular determinants for TA system regulation to inform survival strategies in bacteria.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this work is to explore the dynamic response of summer and winter Asian monsoon variability to changing external drivers, such as insolation, and internal climate variability which will contribute to improved understanding of large-scale hydrological variability in a vulnerable region. Specifically, the researchers will develop a new set of past climate records utilizing multiple environmental tracers (Carbon and Oxygen isotopes, trace elements such as Magnesium/Calcium, radiocarbon) in precisely dated speleothems spanning at least the last ~45 thousand years. Additionally, a detailed cave monitoring program will aid the interpretation of data obtained from the speleothems. The results will be integrated with other regional and global records of past climate variability and state-of-the-art climate model simulations to diagnose the dominant mechanisms driving hydroclimate variability on sub-decadal to millennial timescales in the MESA region. <br/><br/>The research will address the following specific objectives: (1) Determine the summer and fall/winter response of MSEA hydroclimate to orbital and millennial-scale forcing, (2) Determine the response of MSEA hydroclimate to decadal to multidecadal scale sea surface temperature variability, and (3) Synthesize data with other available records to elucidate the spatiotemporal patterns of MSEA hydroclimate, which, combined with paleoclimate model analyses, will allow us investigation of the dynamical mechanisms underlying summer and fall/winter monsoon variability. Speleothem oxygen isotope records from three study sites will serve as a proxy for summer monsoon intensity, dominated by the degree of upstream rainout over the Indian Ocean and trace element measurements will provide robust evidence for past variations in local water balance at each cave site, with Laos sites recording summer rainfall and Vietnam sites recording fall/winter rainfall.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include a better understanding of the monsoon dynamics and related hydroclimate in a vulnerable region by generating quantitative and well-dated multi-millennial climate records from speleothems.

Examples of such systems exist in celestial mechanics (planetary orbits), biology (population dynamics), solid state physics (quasicrystals), mathematical physics (quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators, or, more generally, time-dependent dynamics in systems with localization), and partial differential equations (non-linear Schrodinger and wave equations with periodic coefficients). The analysis of such problems requires dealing with small denominators; in other words, understanding how often and in what pattern would the system return to a state that is very close to the initial state. Traditionally, these problems have been approached by Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM)-type techniques. In the setting of quasiperiodic operators, the main limitations of KAM methods is that they are very difficult to apply to truly multi-dimensional systems, due to the complicated structure of resonances. Alternative approaches (methods based on estimates of Green's functions) do not have these dimensional restrictions. Until recently, those methods have not been as flexible as KAM in the direction of parameter removal. However, this is currently changing largely due to the recent works of the principal investigators (PIs) of this project. The project involves research and training activities towards developing and refining these new methods and applying them to the study of problems involving quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators and nonlinear partial differential equations, obtaining previously inaccessible multi-dimensional and arithmetic results. These have potential applications in all the fields mentioned above.<br/><br/>The technical heart of the proposal is the development of non-perturbative methods for Green?s function estimates for lattice quasiperiodic operators, assuming that the frequency parameter is restricted to a submanifold of a torus. Such problems appear naturally in the analysis of multi-particle quasiperiodic operators as well as nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) and nonlinear wave (NLW) equations, and have been inaccessible until the work of Bourgain?Kachkovskiy which, however, is only the first step since it significantly relies on the two-dimensional setting. These methods will be applied to constructing new classes of spacetime quasiperiodic solutions of the NLS and NLW equations, by lifting the current dimensional and arithmetic restrictions of the Craig?Wayne?Bourgain approach. It is also expected that these methods will allow to construct full-dimensional KAM tori. Recent advances by the PIs from multiple directions also allow, for the first time, to consider arithmetic localization results for multi-dimensional quasiperiodic operators, motivated by recent sharp results obtained by Jitomirskaya and Liu.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concentration of bacteria in these jet drops can be surprisingly high, up to 1000 times more concentrated than in the source. This enrichment may occur because the bubble scavenges particles as it rises.  If so, the degree of enrichment should depend on how close particulates are to the bubble immediately before it pops.  However,  predictions based solely on these ideas are inconsistent with existing data sets. The goal of this project is to uncover the fluid dynamics that determines the enrichment factor for various types and sizes of particles that are encapsulated into these droplets. The results could be important to a variety of problems related to health and the environment. Specifically, the research will lead to a mechanistic understanding of the extent that a particular pathogen is enriched in a particular-sized jet drop. This information is critical to predicting the risk of infection to people exposed to contaminated water sources and to determining appropriate mitigating strategies. Furthermore, the transport of viruses and other marine-derived particles in jet drops has an impact on cloud formation, which is relevant to global climate models. Additionally, the transport of other marine particulates such as microplastics is an important environmental concern, and an understanding of particulate enrichment is critical to estimate transfer rates across the air-water interface. This project will also provide opportunities for early childhood education teachers and engineering graduate students to use drops and bubbles as a pathway to increase the visibility and accessibility of STEM processes to educators and young learners.<br/><br/>Decades of research has explored how rising bubbles can scavenge suspended particulates in a contaminated water source and bring the particulates along with the bubble to the water surface. Similarly, significant research has explored how bubbles can create jet drops as they rupture, motivated in part by the impact that particles within these jet drops can have on health and environment. However, there is limited understanding of how particulates are transported into jet drops during the bubble rupture process. This understanding is critical to predict the enhanced concentrations observed in jet drops and is the objective of this project. Through a combination of direct experiments, numerical simulations, and appropriately dimensionalized mechanistic models, the microscale fluid dynamics by which particles are encapsulated will be investigated. Particular attention will be given to particles that may be brought to the surface by scavenging, but not encapsulated due to their size, physical properties, and location. By modeling the encapsulation process, the degree to which aerosol droplets are concentrated can be predicted for particulates for which experiments are unfeasible or potentially hazardous.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of diverse reactants will be examined in the gas phase, with the ultimate goal of creating a scale to better understand fundamental reactivity. A second focus will be on reactions catalyzed by N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). NHCs are novel organic substances, which have been shown to act as catalysts for a broad range of important synthetic reactions. Mechanisms for these reactions are poorly understood. In both aims, chemical reactions will be studied through a combination of computational models and experiments. Experimental studies are carried out in the gas phase, using a mass spectrometer. The absence of solvent allows for inherent reactivity to be revealed. This project has the potential to establish reactivity patterns for a wide range of organic species and improve the utility of NHCs as catalysts in chemical synthesis.  Improved synthetic methods in turn impact many areas of chemistry, including making pharmaceuticals and other useful chemicals. These fundamental mechanistic studies also provide educational opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate scientists. The project provides mentoring and training for groups underrepresented in science as well.<br/><br/>Gas phase experimental (mass spectrometric) and computational (quantum mechanical) methods are used to interrogate the properties and reactivities of species of organochemical significance.

Small birds and animals are important actors in ecosystems. Their populations are declining in many areas of the world, but the causes are not well-understood, motivating methods to track their locations and habitats. However, obtaining high fidelity data on the location and activity of small wildlife continues to be a challenge. Their small size precludes all but the smallest and most simple telemetry devices, or tags. Guidelines suggest that 70% of bats, birds and terrestrial species should carry tags that weigh less than 0.75 g, 4.4g, and 12.5 g, respectively?about the mass of 1 to 10 paper clips. These mass constraints continue to dictate the use of tiny Very High Frequency (VHF) radio transmitters for small-species localization. Moreover, studies of larger species often continue to rely upon VHF radio tags due to cost constraints. The transmitted radio pulses from these small VHF tags are very challenging to detect and localize. This research will improve the quality of wildlife telemetry data and advance the spatiotemporal understanding of movement and behavior. The developed technology will be open-sourced to enable adoption by the wildlife biology and ecology research communities, with dissemination through a workshop for wildlife professionals. Additionally, increasing public awareness is a core goal of this program; this will be achieved through participation in community and K-12 educational outreach programs.<br/> <br/>This research will develop an optimal tag detection algorithm and software implementation that will enable automated detection while maintaining compatibility with legacy tracking receivers.

The second thread concerns the interplay between discrete geometry (the study of certain highly structured geometric objects) and operator theory. Many of the sub-projects are suitable for undergraduate involvement. The PI will recruit a diverse array of research students to tackle these problems.

This project will produce new mathematics and new mathematicians.<br/><br/>In recent work, the PI and his collaborators used analytic tools familiar in operator theory, harmonic analysis, and random matrix theory to answer virtually all asymptotic questions about factorization lengths in numerical semigroups (staple objects in combinatorics). New probabilistic realizations of certain symmetric multivariate polynomials proved crucial in this work, and also provided proofs of classical positivity results while revealing broad generalizations. In turn, these results promise new applications in operator theory and operator algebras. For example, their combinatorial results suggest a statistical treatment of certain families of AF algebras. The PI also seeks physical and spectral interpretations of the peculiar probability measures that arise when one considers limits of certain combinatorial processes. These measures are of independent interest, for results from computer-aided design (spline theory) have already illuminated some of their properties. The connection between discrete geometry (lattices) and operator theory (Toeplitz determinants and frames) has also proven fruitful. For example, results of the PI and his collaborators on the asymptotics of Toeplitz matrices arose from problems inspired by lattice theory. In the other direction, frame-theoretic constructions and operator-related methods have been used to prove new results about lattices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project builds a detection and analysis cyberinfrastructure, and investigates one of the most distinctive features in the solar atmosphere ? magnetic polarity inversion lines, which are hotspots of the most intense eruptive activity. Analyzing these features enables solar physicists to advance understanding of extreme space weather events and provide needed predictive capabilities for space weather forecasters.<br/><br/>This project creates an innovative and sustainable software infrastructure to detect, characterize and analyze polarity inversion lines. The first step toward that objective is the identification of polarity inversion lines, and quantitative characterization of these multi-faceted features through image descriptors. In subsequent stages, this project analyzes the time series of these features and descriptors using advanced machine learning and data mining techniques, specifically for improving space weather forecasting capabilities. This includes analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of emergence and disappearance for polarity inversion lines, selecting and understanding important shape characteristics of these lines pertinent to solar eruptive activity, and creating a prototype eruption forecasting system with discovered precursors. Automatically identifying and analyzing polarity inversion lines has several direct benefits: physically understanding solar magnetic shear layers and the transition from typical non-eruptive active region states to intense, eruptive ones; making contributions to forecasting of solar eruptions; and generating descriptors and measures that can be useful to the study of shear layers in nature.<br/><br/>This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Solar Terrestrial Physics Program and the Division of Integrative and Collaborative Education and Research within the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complexity science, as pioneered at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) and elsewhere, aims to quantitatively describe and understand the adaptive, evolvable and thus hard-to-predict behaviors of complex systems. One of the greatest lessons of 2020 is how critical this kind of understanding is to our society. We require a scientific workforce capable of integrating theory from biology, social sciences, physics and computer science with mathematical and computational modeling. Despite the centrality of complex systems and the importance of diverse perspectives and international collaboration in addressing the challenges facing our world, purposeful opportunities for PhD student training in these areas are sparse. SFI?s 14-day Complexity Advanced Studies Institutes (ASIs)?based centrally in the EU research network?fills this gap by introducing 18 US PhD students and their EU counterparts to the theory and practice of complex systems modeling in an internationally collaborative setting. After completing Complexity ASIs, participants serve as catalysts in the US scientific workforce, advancing the use of complex systems science to solve imminent problems facing our society and the world.<br/><br/>Complexity ASIs leverage the transdisciplinary ideas, expert faculty, proven training capacity and international reach of SFI, in collaboration with four leading complex systems research institutions in Germany, Austria, Italy and the Netherlands (GAINs) and located centrally in Vienna, Austria. The Complexity-GAINs partnership expands the faculty?s expertise and perspective, gives students access to influential international research partners, and strengthens collaboration among institutions. Students gain foundational knowledge and practice in modeling complex systems of interest through a combination of lectures, discussions, skills tutorials, peer-group problem-solving and hands-on mentored research. The annual program, operating over three years, focuses on different systems each year?intelligent systems, social-behavioral systems, ecosystems?and provides students with broadly applicable tools to recognize and define the universal properties of all complex systems. Following participation in Complexity-GAINs ASIs, PhD students are equipped to (1) describe and better predict the behavior of a complex system through mathematical or computational modeling; and (2) leverage interdisciplinary, international partnerships to achieve shared research and applied goals. The international nature of the program is essential to both goals and will ensure that early-career US researchers are prepared to address complex systems beyond disciplinary and geographic boundaries. An associated outcome of the program is the establishment of a complex systems curriculum and accompanying instructional content for broad dissemination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advancements in magnetic materials and nano-characterization techniques have revealed nanoscale magnetic knots formed by the spins of many electrons. Topology is a property to describe the different types of magnetic knots, and could enable new types of electronic devices for sensing, processing, and storing information. This Collaborative Research project develops abilities to produce, manipulate, and characterize these knotted magnetic features. The project engages a wide age range of students on meaningful research, including training middle-school-aged summer camp students to use an electron microscope to search for nanoscale ?magnetic bow ties?. The project promotes active exchange of students, faculty and researchers between institutions, and both undergraduate and graduate student researchers are educated in a broad range of materials challenges and nanoscale measurement techniques using novel and sophisticated equipment. A key component of the proposal is to foster collaborations between leading international and industrial scientists to provide international research experience for graduate students. This will not only strengthen the scientific excellence and broaden the impact of the research, but it will also provide important educational and post-graduate career opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>New functionality in nanomagnetic devices requires control of magnetic order at the nanometer spatial scale.  Many spin-based devices are still in their infancy and a thorough understanding of the underlying materials and electronic properties and their effect on device performance will be essential for future applications. This Collaborative Research proposal builds on a strong existing collaboration between the PIs Fullerton and McMorran, international and industrial partners, and Harvey Mudd College to achieve a fundamental understanding of and ability to control the topological spin order in nano-structured magnetic materials and devices. The research is particularly interested in the design, manipulation and imaging of thin-film materials that exhibit complex 3-D topological states and defects such as chiral hybrid domain walls, chiral helixes, skyrmions, bi-skyrmions, antiskyrmions and hopfions. The morphology of the domains and defects depends sensitively on the underlying materials properties as well as on the application of magnetic fields, field history, and temperature where domains can arrange in metastable configurations including various topological defects. The team will develop and apply several recent methods in advanced electron microscopy to characterize the structure of these topological states, as well as their behavior under the influence of ultrafast fields.

Common structural steel, for example, is mostly iron with less than two percent of other elements present. Recently, complex concentrated alloys in which multiple elements are present in large amounts, with no single majority element, have been the subject of much research interest because they show promising properties. The precise reasons why the properties of these complex alloys are different from those of simpler alloys are the subject of intense debate. One idea is that the atomic-scale structure of complex alloys is heavily distorted by the presence of so many different kinds of atoms, each of different size. This project seeks to test this idea by careful experimental measurement and detailed computer simulations of structural distortions in complex alloys. An improved understanding of the atomic-scale structure of these novel alloys could lead to the development of new materials with superior mechanical and functional properties. A related educational aspect of the project is to validate a new tool for assessing how well students learn concepts related to the structure of materials, which will contribute to the development of better teaching methods in materials science and engineering.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Multiple-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have been the subject of intense research over the past fifteen years due in part to their promise in structural and functional applications. Early on it was suggested that the crystal lattices of these alloys should be highly distorted due to the need to accommodate atoms of various sizes. Although the lattice distortion hypothesis is widely invoked to explain some of the novel properties of high entropy alloys, evidence in support of it is sparse and contradictory.  This program uses diffuse x-ray and neutron scattering studies of MPEA single crystals together with total scattering experiments on polycrystals to provide unparalleled insight into the nature of lattice distortions, and structural disorder more generally, in complex concentrated alloys. The experiments are supplemented and cross-validated with density functional theory calculations of structure. By comparing disorder in complex (four- and five-component) alloys with compositionally similar but simpler (two- and three-component) alloys the hypothesis that adding components results in a different degree or type of disorder can be tested.  In a complementary set of educational activities, a concept inventory for use in undergraduate courses in Structure of Materials is being completed and validated to show that it measures expert thinking by students. When complete, the validated concept inventory will be disseminated to instructors for use in their courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project?s aim is to develop a practical approach to interactive parallel applications.  The project?s novelty, in addition to focusing on this under-studied intersection of parallelism and interaction, is that it follows an end-to-end methodology that brings together many areas of computer science and bridges theory with practice.  The project has the potential to impact the design of several application areas that require large-scale interactive applications, including web services, desktop clients for CAD/CAM, games, and a variety of mobile applications.  <br/><br/>This research?s end-to-end goals require advances in type systems, programming languages, scheduling theory, and runtime systems.  The research team will develop a calculus for modeling interactive parallel applications at a high level of abstraction. This calculus will equip a fully general formal programming language based on Church's Lambda Calculus with a cost semantics, making it possible 1) to express interactive parallel applications and 2) to reason about the throughput and responsiveness of the programs. A type system will ensure the absence of thorny bugs such as priority inversions that can prevent establishing responsiveness guarantees. The investigators will prove that this calculus is realizable by developing scheduling algorithms that can faithfully match the cost semantics so as to guarantee the desired performance criteria.  On the practical side, the project team will extend Cilk, a C-based parallel programming language, to support interactive parallel applications. This will require developing a run-time system that faithfully implements the scheduling algorithms and optimizations that ensure practical performance.

However, the technology has primarily focused to date on small build volumes; creating large, durable, and high-quality objects at the size of sculptural and architectural construction is still impractical for all but highly trained experts.  Combining state-of-the-art techniques in computer graphics, optimization, and mechanics, this research will lay the algorithmic foundation for introducing textiles in large scale fabrication by exploring their innovative use for fabric formwork: a molding and casting procedure for 3D shapes.  The formwork consists of a flexible fabric membrane whose deformation is governed by equilibrium of the membrane boundary and fluid pressure from the casting material (typically plaster or concrete).  The procedure is capable of producing objects with freeform curved surfaces using minimal material and at a range of scales up to full span architectural beams and columns.  Textiles offer benefits as a lightweight, economical material that can easily form curved surfaces and span large areas, so project outcomes have the potential to dramatically transform how objects are built (for example, consider shipping rolled up fabric formwork to a remote village to build a concrete shelter, where only a simple supporting frame must be constructed on site).

(1) The central contribution is a novel optimization framework that poses fabric formwork as an inverse shape design problem.  Given a target shape, the goal is to navigate the complex space of design options including 3D rest shape computation, surface patterning and segmentation, positioning of external supports, and orientation and boundary conditions during casting. (2) Patterning techniques will be studied for constructing the 3D membrane surface with textiles.  The goal is a generalizable method for free-form 3D shapes with complex geometry and topology.  Surface segmentation into 2D developable panels will be studied to allow construction from flat sheets.  Alternatively, to provide additional possibilities for locally varying elasticity 3D surfaces may be constructed directly using machine knitting procedures.  (3) Drawing upon cognitive principles in perception and domain knowledge in traditional garment making, algorithmic techniques will be investigated for generating visual assembly guides for the final construction phase.  Strategies will be developed for the sequence of assembly (the order in which parts are built), along with visualization techniques for communicating assembly instructions.

These data include genetic and chemical biomarkers of identity, ethnicity, behavior, consumption, pollution, and pathogenic infections. Interest in WBE exploded recently, as researchers turned to wastewater samples to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infection levels in local populations and inform public health responses to the pandemic. Because data collected from wastewater are aggregated at the population level, they are typically assumed to be anonymous, and are therefore not subject to health privacy or other regulatory protections. These data are most useful when shared, yet sharing raises security and privacy issues, for individuals as well as neighborhoods, schools and governments.  The project is developing technology and tools to support legitimate uses of WBE datasets while minimizing abuse, and it is designing protocols for protecting individual and organizational privacy.  These tools will encourage wide participation in WBE consortia by enabling organizations to protect their data from adverse uses, which in turn will help improve the health of the general public and reduce morbidity and mortality.<br/><br/>The project addresses three key security threats: those posed by individual queries; those posed by sharing, whether through joint queries or large-scale association studies; and those posed by the presence of human genetic material in wastewater samples.  These threats are mitigated by: (1) supporting secure queries on wastewaster data using homomorphic encryption; (2) enabling federated data analysis based on secure computation; and (3) protecting genomic privacy with differential privacy. These components are being implemented to allow different entities to execute query processing and train Machine Learning models on joint databases while maintaining the privacy and format of each database.

The interface between differently oriented grains, i.e.,  grain boundaries, strongly influences, if not determine, many mechanical and physical properties of materials, such as strength, ductility (material?s ability to bend before breaking), and resistance to radiation damage. Increasing scientific data suggests that grain boundaries in metals can have many different kinds of atomic arrangements (also known as multiplicity), and the transition between them leads to significant property changes. If we have a better understanding of grain boundary multiplicity and its structure-property relationship, scientists and engineers can devise synthesis strategies to tailor grain boundaries towards enhanced mechanical performance of nanostructured metals. In this project, Dr. Penghui Cao and Dr. Huolin Xin at UC Irvine will use forefront computational modeling and electron microscopy tools to study grain boundary multiplicity at the atomic level and reveal its critical role in determining how nanocrystalline metals deform.  A fundamental understanding of grain boundary multiplicity could facilitate the design of engineering metals with desirable mechanical properties for structural applications, such as aerospace and nuclear energy systems. The project-based education plan aims to attract the participation of high school students from diverse backgrounds and thereby motivate and enable underrepresented minorities to pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project centers on revealing the 3D atomic structure of grain boundaries and fundamentally understanding how grain boundary structure multiplicity influences plastic deformation mechanisms of nanostructured metals. Scientifically, we hypothesize that the plastic deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline metals can be tuned by tailoring grain boundary multiplicity. To test this central hypothesis, we propose research tasks combining atomistic simulation, reaction pathway simulations, theoretical modeling, electron tomography, and in-situ transmission electron microscopy experiments. This integrated computational and experimental study aims to address four major questions: (1) How to determine the 3D atomic structure of grain boundaries, revealing boundary defects, structure units, and multiplicity? (2) How do grain boundary defects and multiplicity influence mobility and migration mechanisms of grain boundaries? (3) Is it possible to control plastic deformation by tailoring grain boundary state and structure multiplicity, which results in enhanced plasticity and ductility in nanocrystalline metals? (4) What are the new deformation mechanisms which can be enabled by defective grain boundary or transformed boundary? The physical insights gained from this research will advance the exploitation of structure-property relationships in nanostructured metals, laying the groundwork for effective tailoring of mechanical behaviors through controlling structure, multiplicity, crystallographic distribution of boundaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project has the potential to impact the design of several application areas that require large-scale interactive applications, including web services, desktop clients for CAD/CAM, games, and a variety of mobile applications.  <br/><br/>This research?s end-to-end goals require advances in type systems, programming languages, scheduling theory, and runtime systems.  The research team will develop a calculus for modeling interactive parallel applications at a high level of abstraction. This calculus will equip a fully general formal programming language based on Church's Lambda Calculus with a cost semantics, making it possible 1) to express interactive parallel applications and 2) to reason about the throughput and responsiveness of the programs. A type system will ensure the absence of thorny bugs such as priority inversions that can prevent establishing responsiveness guarantees. The investigators will prove that this calculus is realizable by developing scheduling algorithms that can faithfully match the cost semantics so as to guarantee the desired performance criteria.  On the practical side, the project team will extend Cilk, a C-based parallel programming language, to support interactive parallel applications. This will require developing a run-time system that faithfully implements the scheduling algorithms and optimizations that ensure practical performance. The educational component of this project, which involves teaching undergraduates parallel algorithms, will create ample opportunities to test the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of signals are sound, images, time series and weather data. Such signals are analyzed via the overlaying (superposition) of basic harmonics of well-specified duration, intensity and frequency. These basic harmonics are functions called wavelets. Image or audio denoising, compression, or pattern recognition are accomplished by filter processing, which refers to a suitable superposition of each wavelet after the action of the filter on it. This is also known as the time-frequency method. A particular concrete example of a re-construction process is used in tomographic imaging, where the shape of a solid body is re-composed from samples of the body along one or two-dimensional rays of penetrating waves, which can be mathematically described as lines or planes in three dimensional space. One component of this mathematics research project focuses on a new family of methods for the wavelet description of the class of singular integral operators, arising for instance in the time-frequency analysis of highly oscillatory signals. Another component of this research project is concerned with the mathematical properties of sampling solid objects along lines or planes. The integrated broader impact activities focus on strengthening the pool of socioeconomically disadvantaged, ethnical minority students (underrepresented groups) in graduate degrees in mathematics and improving retention. Activities connected to training and mentoring of graduate students in Analysis and topical dissemination of knowledge will also be carried out. <br/> <br/>The broad aim of the first circle of questions is to produce representation formulas for classes of singular integrals in terms of so-called model operators conserving the same invariance structure. This paradigm applies to Zygmund-type operators and modulation invariant operators akin to the bilinear Hilbert transform, both of which are out of reach for dyadic-probabilistic methods. Concrete applications come from elliptic and dispersive PDE, operator theory and quasi-conformal mappings. The second related family of questions is motivated by pointwise convergence of bilinear ergodic averages for Banach-valued functions, a celebrated theorem by Bourgain in the scalar case. The approach is based on Banach-valued variational estimates for the truncated bilinear Hilbert transform. The central item in a further set of questions concerning directional singular integrals is a version of the Kakeya maximal estimate where tubular averages are replaced with averages over singular line segments, and more generally, n-dimensional subspaces. One source of motivation is the connection with Fourier restriction in higher codimensions. The methods involve algebra-geometric techniques such as polynomial partitioning on manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are three research objectives. The first objective seeks to identify the most appropriate measures of surgical performance to provide as supplemental feedback and to determine the frequency of haptic cueing most appropriate for endovascular surgical navigation tasks. The second objective seeks to implement the vibrotactile feedback on the ANGIO Mentor endovascular simulator, and then assess learning on endovascular navigation techniques in two groups of trainees.  One group will receive real-time performance-based haptic feedback and the other will serve as the control group.  The third objective seeks to model the empirical results and to use the models to determine how to refine the training protocols to optimize skill acquisition. An additional set of human subject experiments will test the optimized feedback scheme. This project will advance the national health, prosperity and welfare making surgical training faster and more consistent, which should improve the success rate of endovascular surgery and improve patient outcomes. The project will also advance the science of skill acquisition more generally by providing data on how surgeons learn. Outreach and mentoring programs will further broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering.<br/><br/>Previous research has demonstrated that movement smoothness measures computed from surgical tool tip kinematics are strong predictors of surgical expertise. Further, it has been shown that providing real-time haptic feedback based on these metrics can positively influence task completion time and trajectory on a non-surgical task. In this project, the study team will leverage the data collection abilities of a virtual reality surgical simulator platform as a first step towards improving the efficiency and efficacy of surgical training. The plan is to provide endovascular surgical trainees with supplemental real-time, individualized, performance-based feedback. This feedback, based on measures of tool movement smoothness and motor coordination, will be encoded as vibrotactile cues provided to the trainee via a wearable haptic device as they navigate to simulated anatomical targets within the VR simulator. Human subject experiments involving surgical residents will examine the complex learning dynamics that underly human skill acquisition within the context of endovascular surgery. Mathematical models of skill acquisition will be fitted to the experimental data to identify principles guiding the adaptation of real-time supplemental feedback with the aim of improving learning outcomes and training efficiency. The project's findings will advance an understanding of the potential role of supplemental feedback on skill acquisition, which will ultimately advance understanding of relevance to human motor control, endovascular surgery, haptics, dynamical systems modeling, and experimental psychology communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main foci of this project are some of the most fundamental and universal examples of groups: symmetric groups, which arise as symmetries of finite sets, and general linear groups, which arise as symmetries of finite-dimensional vector spaces. Representation theory studies groups via their actions on other mathematical objects, such as vector spaces. Very informally, representations of a group are snap-shots of the group taken from different directions. In the past few years, the idea of categorification has become very important and has led to the development of higher representation theory. This involves actions of groups on higher mathematical structures called categories, utilizing not only the relations between these structures (functors) but also relations between the relations (natural transformations). In particular, Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier (KLR) algebras encode higher symmetries underlying a large part of representation theory, including classical objects like symmetric and general linear groups. The goal of this project is to further build the theory of these and other algebras and apply it to improve our understanding of the classical objects of group theory. The research in this project has potential future broader impacts in computer science and theoretical physics. More directly this award will have important educational impact through the training of graduate students and mentoring young researchers in this area. <br/> <br/>In more detail, this project is concerned with several diverse projects in representation theory of Lie algebras, finite groups, and related objects such as Hecke algebras, quantum groups, Schur algebras and KLR algebras. Our perspective draws on recent advances in higher representation theory, namely categorification, with various diagrammatically defined monoidal categories and 2-categories playing a prominent role. On the other hand, many applications are to classical problems in representation theory such as block theory of finite groups and Schur algebras as well as structure theory of finite groups. We will study local description of blocks of Schur algebras up to derived equivalence, cuspidal algebras for KLR algebras, thick Heisenberg categorification, super Kac-Moody 2-categories and applications to blocks of double covers of symmetric groups, homological properties of KLR algebras, decomposition numbers, and irreducible restrictions from quasi-simple groups to subgroups.

Today's AI services are mostly trained in remote data centers and accessed via the Internet. However, increasingly, as large volumes of training data are generated by end users and inference tasks are also performed on premises, AI needs to be moved to the network edge in closer proximity to users. The objective of this project is to address this emerging paradigm shift by orchestrating the distributed computing and networking infrastructures and provisioning AI as a service from the network edge to serve large numbers of users at different locations.<br/><br/>This project will define the optimization problems, design the control algorithms, and develop the deployable implementations for operating AI as a service across cloud-edge networks and mobile devices. Centered on system dynamics and uncertainty, the project consists of multiple research thrusts. First, the project will optimize the training and the inference of AI through making smart decisions on participant selection, model placement, aggregation control, and request dispatching, and will produce time-based algorithms running in an online manner with provable performance guarantees. Second, the project will investigate the interactions among different parties in the AI service ecosystem from an economics perspective, and will devise incentive mechanisms towards superior resource utilization and optimal social welfare with desired economic properties. Third, the project will conduct a combination of simulations, measurements, and implementations with real-world data traces and realistic experimental settings to comprehensively evaluate and validate the models, algorithms, and systems.<br/><br/>This project will impact the industry by providing telecom carriers, network operators, and service providers with a critical set of techniques to enable them to provision and operate dedicated or value-added edge-AI services upon distributed infrastructures. Further, the project will devise novel theories and algorithms based on the mathematics of optimization, control, learning, and mechanism design, and could be of independent interest and have extended applications to problems in other related fields that also face dynamic and uncertain inputs. Finally, besides contributing to undergraduate and graduate course materials, the project will execute the education plan that focuses on facilitating K-12 education via training teachers and also equipping students with AI knowledge and experiences in an ethical manner.<br/><br/>The deliverables of this project, which include but are not limited to papers, data, and codes, will be made publicly available at the following website: https://github.com/ai-at-edge.

In number theory and the Langlands program, one is interested in functions on certain homogeneous spaces, where the ""waves"" are special eigenfunctions of Laplacians and Hecke operators, called automorphic forms. Some of the most mysterious and important invariants of the automorphic forms are the L-functions, a vast class of generalizations of the Riemann zeta function. A significant, but not well-understood, principle is that their superposition often represents a function that can be described independently, in terms of what are known as spherical varieties that give rise to a distribution called the period distribution.  The amplitudes of the spectral decomposition of this distribution turn out to be special values of L-functions. The project will investigate conjectural connections between period distributions and L-functions using ideas of quantization (whose roots lie in mathematical physics). The PI also plans yearly meetings to train students and postdocs on the topics related to this proposal. <br/><br/>According to the visionary program developed since the '60s by Abel Prize recipient Robert P. Langlands, L-functions should be understood as invariants of automorphic representations; those are the ""eigenfrequencies"" of ""arithmetic manifolds"", or else the representations of a (reductive) Lie group G, and of its algebra of Hecke operators, which appear as functions on a quotient L\G, where L is an arithmetic lattice. The precise incarnation of L-functions in this setting is by means of certain distributions called ""periods"", which the PI and others have studied and organized into a coherent theory in recent years. The present award aims to utilize ideas of symplectic geometry in the study of these periods. Among other goals, this project will study: (1) the duality between periods and L-functions as a duality between Hamiltonian spaces for the group and its dual group (building up on recent work with Ben-Zvi and Venkatesh); (2) the local spectrum of spherical varieties by combining the relative trace formula of Waldspurger with the geometry of the moment map studied by Knop; (3) the ""transfer operators"" of functoriality, in the spirit of Langlands' ""beyond endoscopy"", between the relative trace formulas of different groups and spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include (1) data-poisoning attacks in machine learning (ML), where even a small fraction of adversarial data inserted by malicious users can substantially degrade the quality of the ML system, and (2) exploratory analysis of scientific datasets (e.g., in biology), where systematic errors can create structured corruptions that require painstaking effort to detect. To address these challenges, there is a real need to develop efficient robust learning algorithms -- methods whose performance is stable to deviations from the idealized assumptions about the input data. The precise form of these deviations is problem-specific and gives rise to various notions of robustness. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a general algorithmic theory of high-dimensional robust statistics and learning. A crucial component of the project involves building bridges between different communities, by organizing interdisciplinary workshops, and writing a new graduate textbook on the topic. Moreover, the investigators are mentoring undergraduate students and design new data-centric courses integrating research and teaching.<br/><br/>The technical core of this project consists of two interrelated thrusts: (1) List-Decodable Learning and Mixture Models: The majority of recent literature in algorithmic high-dimensional robust learning focuses on the setting where the clean data is the majority of the dataset. List-decodable learning is a relaxed notion of learning capturing the regime where the clean data is a minority of the input dataset, and can be used to model important data-science applications, such as crowdsourcing with a majority of unreliable respondents and learning-mixture models.  The project is developing a unified theory with the goal of uncovering which distributional parameters can be efficiently list-decoded, and leveraging this theory to understand the complexity of learning mixture models. (2) Robust Supervised Learning of Geometric Concepts: The goal of supervised learning is to infer a function from a collection of labeled observations. Supervised learning has traditionally been concerned with the problem of generalizing from a set of correctly labeled examples. In many realistic scenarios, a fraction of the points and/or labels may be corrupted by noise, e.g., due to sensor errors or adversarial data poisoning. Hence, it is important to develop efficient algorithms that produce accurate predictors under these conditions. The project is developing efficient robust learning algorithms for rich families of geometric concepts with respect to natural and well-studied semi-random noise models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Feedback is intended to promote student learning and achievement.  However, relatively little research has explicitly studied how STEM students interpret feedback and whether feedback has its intended effects. This project will examine how students? reactions to feedback are shaped by their self-perceptions, such as their confidence in mastering STEM material and their feelings of being accepted in the field.  The project will test whether several types of feedback produce equally beneficial outcomes for students with different self-perceptions. The goal of the project is to build a knowledge base about the factors that affect students? responses to academic feedback.  It is anticipated that this knowledge may be incorporated into evidence-based STEM teaching practices at many types of institutions. In addition, knowledge gained about how students? self-perceptions shape their reactions should be relevant to other aspects of STEM teaching and course design, such as describing learning goals or the instructor?s teaching philosophy. <br/><br/>Individuals vary in their academic self-perceptions, with some feeling higher efficacy and belonging in the field than others. Systematic differences also exist between students, with women on average reporting lower efficacy and belonging in STEM than men. The impact of these individual and gender differences on students? reactions to academic feedback will be examined in laboratory studies in which student volunteers agree to complete representative STEM assignments that are evaluated by a person who is communicating with the student online. The study will examine key variables shown to affect responses to feedback in other contexts, such as the gender of the evaluator, students? self-efficacy, and whether students think the evaluator knows their gender. As a second major goal, the project will also evaluate specific theory-informed ways to deliver feedback with the goal of maximizing the benefits of feedback for all students.

As a result, the need for skilled energy technicians has grown and the skills they need are more complex.  In Northeast Wisconsin, the demand for energy management technicians continues to exceed the supply of qualified applicants. Thus, new strategies are needed to address shortages and create a workforce of skilled technicians to manage these technologies.

Specifically, the project intends to develop an energy management educational program that bridges mechanical equipment engineering skills with information technology and computational skills.  The program will be designed to prepare a skilled technical workforce that will address energy management needs in an increasingly internet-connected, global society.<br/><br/>Faculty in the existing Energy Management Technology program and the College?s K-12 relations manager will collaborate with industry and secondary education representatives to educate students, instructors, and educational leaders about today?s smart technology-driven building control systems.

The SRC is an annual conference sponsored by the SRCOS. The purpose of the SRC is to encourage the interchange and mutual understanding of current research ideas in statistics and biostatistics, and to provide motivation and direction to further research progress.  This project will focus on young researchers, giving them an opportunity to participate in the meeting and to interact closely with leaders in the field in a manner not possible at larger meetings. The SRC is particularly valuable for graduate students, undergraduate students, isolated statisticians, and faculty from smaller regional schools in the southern region at drivable distances without the cost of travel to distant venues. Speakers will present formal research talks with adequate time allowed for clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups.  Under the travel support provided by this award, graduate students will attend and present their research in posters to be reviewed by more experienced researchers. <br/><br/>In addition to the graduate student participation, the 56th SRC will also include the second annual Statistical Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE), a conference within a conference aimed to encourage the participation of undergraduate students from under-represented groups to pursue graduate education and career opportunities in STEM fields.  SURE will include events specifically for undergraduate students and undergraduate mentors, such as a panel about career opportunities in statistics, a ?Real Data Analytics Workshop,? and a speed-mentoring session with current statistics and biostatistics graduate students. The support provided by this award will support SURE and encourage under-represented students to enter STEM fields, including statistics or biostatistics, and provide training to support this endeavor. The 56th SRC will strengthen the research of the statistics and biostatistics community as a whole and help bridge the gap for under-represented groups to pursue statistics or biostatistics, particularly in the sixteen states of the Southern Region.

They are being investigated as potentially disruptive materials for quantum information science. The novel structures to be investigated are comprised of 3-dimensional networks of silicon cages and 2-dimensional networks of silicon tunnels that have the unique ability to trap dopant atoms in precise site locations that minimize interaction with the silicon crystalline lattice.  The trapped atoms can act as qubits, the basic element for storing quantum information. These materials could overcome major hurdles being faced with conventional silicon, like challenges with optical coupling and decay of signal due to interactions of qubits with the silicon lattice. Hence, the project could enable optically efficient silicon-based devices, a holy grail of the silicon community. This research benefits society by providing a new class of materials that would revolutionize several global technological fields including computer chips, lasers, detectors, and telecommunications. The project includes strong and novel education and outreach activities that provide exciting opportunities for K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate students, and underrepresented groups in STEM, including summer workshops and internships, research experiences for undergraduates, and community outreach. With the project focus on materials development for quantum computing and related applications this is an exceptional opportunity to attract new students to STEM, with innovative design of new hands-on, exportable, activities for a broad range of students and their teachers (elementary, middle, high school), including underrepresented and low income communities in Denver. These activities are designed as both hybrid and in-person. Modules also specifically target the Rocky Mountain Dyslexic Camp for students at all levels.   <br/><br/>Technical description: The project is focused on advancing the knowledge on critical properties and controls of spin-defect states that are needed for quantum information science materials. The inherent structure and properties of novel crystalline silicon allotropes provides precise interstitial sites for dopants/qubits to sit, along with the potential for low sensitivity to thermal excitation and long spin lifetimes and decoherence times, coupled with a direct bandgap within the telecommunications wavelength. The project provides new understanding of spin defects and the research activities could lead to a completely new class of quantum information science materials. The project goals are to design, synthesize, and control the structure-properties of crystalline silicon allotropes with interstitial dopants (inside cages or channels), with controlled defect spin-states with lower sensitivity than diamond Si to thermal excitation and spin relaxation, to mitigate key issues in diamond silicon for revolutionary quantum information science materials. The project scope includes thin film synthesis and design of silicon allotropes with different crystal structures and dopant types and concentrations/site occupation to enable systematic investigations to understand and control the interstitial spin defect states of the dopants and the relations of structure, optical, electrical, and quantum properties. The project approach and methods include: (i) Synthesis and design of thin films to produce high phase purity allotropes with desired dopants; (ii) Investigation of the structural (X-ray diffraction; confocal Raman; scanning electron microscopy; time of flight secondary ionization mass spectrometry), optical (photoluminescence spectroscopy, absorption), and electrical (conductivity and mobility) property-relations; (iii) Measurement of spin-defect states using continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; (iv) Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance study of spin coherence. Revolutionary discoveries from this project are possible because of the research team?s unique expertise in silicon allotrope synthesis/properties, in fundamental defect/dopant science and in solid-state dopant-based quantum information science approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the symmetry of these rings has proven fruitful not only in many areas of mathematics, but also in applications to error-correcting codes, which allow us to send data over astronomical distances while removing corruptions from noisy transmission. The project will also involve undergraduate and graduate students in research.<br/><br/>Specifically, the rings with symmetries studied in this proposal range from more commutative to less commutative rings.  The commutative projects include invariant theory of polynomial rings, Stanley-Reisner rings, and Varchenko-Gelfand rings.  The proposal also studies the representations of the symmetry groups on anti-commutative rings like exterior algebras and Orlik-Solomon algebras.

Learning progressions, which are models of how student thinking develops within a domain, have potential to provide actionable information to teachers to guide instruction. Facilitation may support collaborative problem solving and make visible student thinking with respect to learning progressions. In this project, the team will address questions about how collaborative problem solving, learning progressions, and facilitation interact in the development of students? mathematical learning. The work affords an opportunity to advance equitable access to high-quality education for all students by enhancing the quality of instruction for students lacking opportunities to learn key concepts of mathematics because of the inequitable structures of education in the country. The project team anticipates that their work will generate resources and findings for future work, such as a version of the learning progression that can be used by teachers to interpret student work and information about how students and facilitators can use online collaborative technology in support of mathematics learning and assessment.<br/><br/>The project team will integrate learning progression assessment tasks into an online collaborative learning and assessment platform. The tasks focus on the concept of function, a foundational area of mathematics, and are designed for students in Grades 9 through 12. Students will engage with the tasks in four phases: first, they will solve a task individually. Second, they will revisit that task as part of a 3- or 4- person team in a collaborative environment. Some team discussions will be facilitated by near-peer mentors. Third, the teams will present their results to the class. Students will engage in a whole class discussion with facilitation and wrap up by the teacher. Finally, students will respond individually to a conceptually similar task. Discourse will be coded using both domain-specific and domain-general coding schemes that identify cognitive, social, and facilitation practices during team collaboration and class discussion; results will attend to the both the focus and the development of ideas over the course of discussion.

Watson of the University of Delaware is studying the new catalytic methods to prepare organic molecules that contain silicon atoms. Such molecules, commonly called organosilanes, are important building blocks for the complex organic chemical compounds that are used as pharmaceuticals, as agrochemicals, and for the study of biology. This research aims to develop new reactions that allow for these important silicon containing compounds to be prepared in new, straightforward ways using inexpensive starting materials and catalytic amounts of reaction promoters. Not only will this research expand access to organosilanes, but it will also increase fundamental understanding of the reactions silicon containing molecules and their interactions with transition metal catalysts. The program will also train undergraduate student, graduate student and post-doctoral researchers, and will build outreach programs to both early childhood education and undergraduate-only higher educations institutions that lack advanced research technology. In so doing, the research program will seek to train the next generation of chemical scientist who will tackle the challenges of tomorrow. <br/><br/>The focus of the research program is the development of new cross-coupling reactions of electrophilic silanes. Using transition metal catalysts, Dr. Donald Watson and his students seek to develop new methods for C-Si bond construction to prepare a variety of both saturated and unsaturated organosilanes via cross-coupling with simple organic nucleophiles. To achieve this result, the Watson group has designed a new type of silyl-Heck reaction with analogy to the robust and highly studied parent Heck reaction of alkenes.  This newer silyl variant of the Heck coupling is expected to permit access to otherwise challenging vinylic and allylic silane targets.  The Watson team then seeks to develop related multi-component transformations to access even more complex and highly substituted alkylsilanes. In parallel to the development of these new synthetic methods, Dr. Watson and his students will seek to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) of the transformations under study.  Therefore, this project will provide exposure to synthetic, mechanistic and physical organic chemistry for the student and postdoctoral co-workers on the team, and in this way prepare them well for future careers in industry or academia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, Dr. Wang and his group plan to develop new complexes based on late first-row transition metals and a novel tridentate ligand platform discovered only recently. These metal complexes are expected to be strong oxidants to activate inert carbon-hydrogen bonds in hydrocarbon substrates and install desired functional groups on them.

Reuse/repurposing of retired electric vehicle (EV) batteries has been considered as a critical approach for facilitating transportation electrification and renewable power generation, which are two cornerstones of the emerging clean energy revolution essential to our national prosperity. EV batteries are mandated to retire with 80% remaining capacity, and direct disposal would mean a substantial waste of the remaining value. Repurposing these batteries for the less-demanding stationary storage, e.g. to store the renewable but intermittent solar/wind energy, could significantly improve the cost and sustainability of both EV and renewable power generation industries. A key challenge facing repurposing is the risk of unsafe/unhealthy battery operation due to the damage and degradation suffered from the first use. Therefore, current repurposing practice requires tedious and costly manual testing and grading of each retired battery module. Still, such one-time testing can only guarantee safety and performance at the beginning but not during subsequent operation. A key enabler for battery repurposing at a much larger scale is the advanced technique for accurate, fast, automatic, and continuous estimation of battery states and parameters. The research component of this project will be integrated with an education plan with the theme ?Connecting Emerging ML/AI with Traditional Control? to achieve the PI?s overarching education goal of promoting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) education among engineering students and professionals, especially underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The research will explore active learning of second-life batteries, where the input current is regulated to optimize the information content of the response battery voltage to improve the speed and accuracy of estimation. The key innovation is a generic active learning framework, which combines the principle of reinforcement learning with device physics to overcome the fundamental limitations in the current practice of active learning. This is among the first attempts to use reinforcement learning for estimation, which presents a series of fundamental research problems in information state computation, reward and learning architecture design, and convergence analysis. The second part of the research focuses on promoting the learning performance for multi-modular systems through module collaboration. The goal is to address fundamental challenges of reinforcement learning, e.g. the need for massive training data and slow convergence, by enabling data sharing and cooperative search among modules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vanderwal of the Department of Chemistry at UC Irvine (UCI) is developing innovative approaches for the assembly of structurally complex naturally occurring molecules. The underlying theme of the work is the strategic use of readily available molecular building blocks to arrive at the complex architectures of the targeted natural products in as few chemical operations as possible. In so doing, existing chemical methods will be pushed to their limits by their use in very challenging contexts, and new strategies for rapidly building complicated molecular architectures are expected to be uncovered. The results of these studies will positively impact the many areas of applied science that benefit from chemical synthesis, including pharmaceutical development and materials science. This grant will also permit outreach activities to middle school students from underserved communities to engage in scientific experiments on-campus, and simultaneously learn about the college experience.  The Vanderwal group will further engage in the mentorship of local community college students and enable them to have their first laboratory research experiences.<br/>		<br/>The core of these research studies lie in the development of several strategies for the rapid assembly of the complex molecular architectures of several interesting natural products. First, the complex polycyclic alkaloid arcutinidine, which has been synthesized via lengthy sequences by other chemists, will be targeted via a concise and highly convergent design that seeks to unite two equally complex pieces via a short multiple-bond-forming sequence. Second, the dihydro-beta-agarofurans?a group of over 500 stereochemically complex, highly oxygenated terpenoids with many interesting biological properties?will be assembled in an efficient manner starting from a highly oxidized B-ring, which itself will be accessed via novel applications of either stereoselective benzene reductions or asymmetric Diels?Alder chemistry. Finally, the potent and selective anti-pancreatic-tumor agent aleutianamine will be synthesized by a novel intramolecular cycloaddition reaction, which will also drive the development of new reactivity. The broader impacts of this work include the exceptional research training for undergraduate and graduate students. This grant also supports the UCI-LEAPS program that brings in local middle school students for day-long experiences in university chemistry and physics laboratories, and the UC-SCC program that supports the internship of local community college students in chemistry labs at UCI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Search engines that allow users to find answers to pretty much all of their questions are expected to deliver results in less than a second, while understanding the customer with a high probability based on just a few words of input. This is not the type of computation that is precise and gives the ?correct? answer; it instead provides solutions that are more associative, mimicking the human way of addressing problems. In fact, many problems in the real world are probabilistic in nature, and conventional computing schemes are not optimized for these tasks. In 1982 Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman stated in recognition of this fact: ?The way to simulate a probabilistic nature might still be by a computer which itself is probabilistic... So, it becomes what I?ll call a probabilistic computer, in which the output is not a unique function of the input.?

Moreover, educational tools, new courses and training opportunities both for undergraduate and graduate students are being created that expose them to a device-to-systems research program on probabilistic computing in order to prepare them for the new era of electronics.<br/><br/>The project adopts a Device-to-Systems approach that covers experiments from single devices and small circuits all the way up to simulations with thousands of devices. It addresses the question of how to implement probabilistic functionality in hardware from a variety of different angles. The key objective of this proposal is to take the next step in the development of probabilistic computing by experimental demonstrations of integrated probabilistic bits (p-bits) and p-circuits and quantifying advantages of scaled probabilistic computers through key figures-of-merits in system-level applications based on experimental input. This is being achieved by employing unstable magnets in a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) configuration as random number generators that become tunable by the use of field-effect transistors in a suitable circuit layout. Initial projections estimate that if integrated MTJs coupled with conventional transistors can be scaled up, one can expect to achieve orders of magnitude improvements compared to what is achievable in conventional semiconductor technology in key figures-of-merits, such as the number of statistically independent samples per second (also referred to as flips per second) that a probabilistic sampler can go through.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving dominant status has important consequences for primate males, including in terms of their ability to sire offspring. While the role of hormones in regulating the achievement of dominant status is well characterized, much less is known about how odor and olfaction contribute to status outcomes. The researchers use an integrative approach to measure phenotypic, physiological, and behavioral variation among male white-faced capuchin monkeys to advance a comprehensive understanding of the roles that olfactory communication plays in regulating rank achievement. The research contributes to a broader understanding of what roles olfaction plays in the biology and behavior of primates. Throughout the project, the research team will engage in K-12 STEM education outreach by providing workshops to students and teachers. Additional STEM talent building will occur through the training and mentorship of a diverse group of young scientists, including undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, and graduate students, as well as an early-career postdoctoral scientist.<br/><br/>The aim of this research is to test the hypothesis that odors regulate the expression of dominant and subordinate male morphs in male white-faced capuchins. Specifically, the investigators will 1) quantify the morphology and physiology of capuchin male morphs in relation to rank (dominant versus subordinate); 2) characterize olfactory behavioral variation (e.g., sniffing, urinary marking) in relation to rank; and 3) determine the chemical basis for differences in scent in relation to rank. The researchers use cutting-edge, integrative methods to track changes in morphology, behavior, and physiology, including digital photogrammetry, behavioral observation, and assessment of hormonal changes, to facilitate causal understanding of the temporal sequence of changes related to attainment of dominant status. Moreover, by simultaneously measuring behavioral and biological variation involved in male rank morphs in a wild primate, this research contributes creative, original insights to advance knowledge of the proximate mechanisms underlying rank, with important implications for understanding status and phenotypic differentiation ? as well as the roles played by sensory biology ? in primate evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microplastics (plastic particles less than 5 millimeters) have received increased scientific attention as they have been found around the globe, including recent studies which have shown microplastic contamination in remote locations. However, questions remain about the sources, transport, and fate of microplastics deposited in the environment. The goal of this study is to measure the amount and type of microplastics deposited in snow and snow-fed water resources in the Sierra Nevada of California and Nevada. Measurements will be used to assess the sources of microplastics to the remote environment and the downstream fate of microplastics in important water resources.

With a focus on snow and water resources in the Sierra Nevada of California and Nevada, the proposed work will develop methods for microplastic isolation and detection, conduct spatial and temporal sampling of snow, snowmelt, air and water, and apply infrared microscopy and Pyrolysis-GC/MS for characterization of type and amount of microplastics. The study will improve our understanding of sources to remote locations, microplastic transport in snow-dominated systems, and downstream contamination. It will further generate data that can be used to better understand human impacts to freshwater resources beyond the Sierra Nevada, including other snow-dominated environments around the globe.

However, little is known about the social consequences of these policies. This research project will study the socio-political and distributional effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) induced by these policy changes.  Using the staggered liberalization of access to foreign capital across several industry groups, the research will attempt to answer the following questions: (1) Does foreign capital liberalization in the manufacturing and/or service sector accelerate the process of changing the structure of economies? (2) What are the social, economic, health, and political, and distributional consequences of foreign capital liberalization policies, especially for vulnerable groups, such as women, racial and other minorities?  The research project will build a large data set disaggregated at local administration level to study these issues.  The results of this research project will guide policies to deal with the possible economic effects of foreign direct investment.  It will also provide guidance on policies to decrease the possible negative social consequences and distributional effects of foreign direct investments.  <br/><br/>This project exploits the staggered liberalization of foreign capital flows to different disaggregated industries at different times to measure the causal average and distributional effects of foreign capital liberalization. This project has two parts: The first part measures the effects on occupational switching, gender attitudes, human capital, and fertility. The second part will measure the effects on social outcomes related to the rise of populism, such as crime, political attitudes, and religious violence. Treatment of industry by foreign capital liberalization is measured by the pre- and post-reform mix of industries in a district. The analysis will then use a local labor market difference-in-differences (diff-in-diff) strategy to compares outcome change in affected and non affected districts from the pre- to post-reform period. The project will build panel datasets that will be harmonized at the district-level to measure the distribution effects of policy changes. This project will provide one of the first causal evidence on the effects of foreign capital liberalization on structural change as well as on a broad range social effects, such as female labor force participation, fertility, and education.

Unfortunately, these losses are only mounting. Reducing the toll of disasters depends critically upon engineers systematically documenting hazard impacts on the built environment and ensuring the resulting knowledge swiftly informs new regulatory policies and construction practices guiding more resilient recovery and rebuilding. This award will expand the role of the Structural Extreme Events Reconnaissance (StEER) Network in these efforts to learn from natural disasters. This project will streamline the network?s core operations, supporting volunteer engineers as they collect and process valuable post-disaster data. In parallel, this project will develop new protocols for more efficient data collection and processing as well as knowledge dissemination to constituencies in research, policy, and practice. These protocols will broaden the participation of the research community, including undergraduate students, while building their capacity for high-quality forensic data. The research community will further benefit from the resulting Science Plan that ensures post-disaster observations inform future research and its translation into policy and practice. By more effectively utilizing the opportunity to not only learn but act upon the knowledge gained in the study of disasters, this project will help communities to become more resilient and sustainable.  This project will contribute to the National Science Foundation (NSF) roles in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). <br/><br/>This project will develop new protocols that enhance the StEER network?s efficiency, achieved through the outputs of six interconnected objectives, beginning with: (1) a tiered, regional data collection model for more agile field responses, (2) a workflow that unifies structural assessments across hazards and building typologies, (3) new capacities for automated data collection and synthesis, and (4) a damage quantification scheme offering more objective evaluations of performance compatible with established rating systems. Outputs of these four objectives will enhance the network?s core operations to lessen data collection/processing demands, increase efficiency, and reduce latency. This in turn will enable the network?s members to direct more energy toward in-depth forensic evaluations, feeding this learning into new dissemination conduits, formed through the addition of (5) a constituent-focused reconnaissance engagement and communications hub. This is coupled with (6) observation-driven science planning that links the network?s findings to research and technology transfer opportunities. In total, this will result in a more coherent natural hazards engineering research agenda and ultimately will help translate next-generation mitigation strategies into practice.

From ancient cave paintings to modern digital graphics, such technologies lie at the heart of some of our most significant inventions, including art, writing, and mathematics. Despite the importance of such technologies, little is known about how the human mind is capable of using them in such varied ways. Perhaps the most basic and versatile of these technologies is drawing, which can be used to convey information about the visual world at many levels of abstraction, ranging from realistic illustrations to simplified diagrams. This project will harness large datasets and advanced data analysis techniques to develop a rigorous understanding of the mental processes involved when people use drawings to communicate visual concepts in different ways. Results from this project will advance our understanding of why people prefer to use certain kinds of images in some contexts and not others, with implications for how to design effective visualizations for a variety of applications, including STEM education and research. This project?s focus on the problem of how abstract ideas can be communicated in clear and accessible ways extends to its education plan. This plan encompasses two initiatives to develop inclusive learning experiences that promote computational literacy among K-12 and undergraduate students that have historically faced systemic obstacles to this training.<br/><br/>Aim 1 of this project seeks to resolve a classic debate concerning whether drawings derive their meaning by resembling objects in the world (i.e., are image-like) or by being composed of discrete symbolic expressions (i.e., are language-like). The proposed experiments will evaluate the hypothesis that drawings are neither purely image-like nor purely language-like, but can vary strongly depending on what the illustrator can see, what they know, and what information they wish to communicate. To test this hypothesis, the proposed analyses will employ crowdsourcing and computer-vision techniques to measure the degree to which different drawings preserve perceptual information and/or are organized into discrete symbolic units. For example, some drawings may contain rich visual details that resist summarization in words, while other drawings may be entirely composed of simpler marks that can be readily described using words. Aim 2 will investigate the process by which people come up with new ways to visually communicate with each other over time. The proposed experiments will evaluate the hypothesis that drawings that initially resemble a concrete object tend to become increasingly abstract and symbol-like when people repeatedly communicate about it, reflecting shared goals and knowledge between communicators. The proposed analyses will measure consistency and variability in the resulting drawings, providing quantitative insight into the factors that affect the development of new symbolic systems for communication. Aim 3 seeks to better align the scientific training undergraduate psychology students receive to the reality of modern scientific practice in psychology. Specifically, it will integrate teaching of open-science best practices, exploratory data visualization, and model-based data analysis into the introductory statistics curriculum in Psychology at University of California San Diego, as well as collaborative final research projects to help students synthesize what they have learned and hone their communication skills. Aim 4 strives to broaden access to general education about artificial intelligence (AI) in historically underserved communities by partnering with local K-12 schools to develop learning experiences that illustrate the relevance of AI to students? everyday lives, as well as how AI intersects with other disciplines, including the arts, psychology, medicine, and law.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A family of membrane-embedded proteins that transduces signals across the plasma membrane, known as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), stimulates diverse processes such as the growth of blood vessels or the response to insulin.  Intriguingly, individual RTKs can respond to multiple signals, and the biological consequences of the response can differ.  How a single RTK can trigger distinct downstream processes in response to different stimuli is unknown. The goal of the project is to establish a method that quantifies the very first step in the information transfer pathway to define the efficiency of signal transduction across the plasma membrane.  Differences in the efficiencies with which the various stimuli signal through an RTK may explain the distinct processes triggered by the stimuli.

Topology is a property to describe the different types of magnetic knots, and could enable new types of electronic devices for sensing, processing, and storing information.

Many spin-based devices are still in their infancy and a thorough understanding of the underlying materials and electronic properties and their effect on device performance will be essential for future applications. This Collaborative Research proposal builds on a strong existing collaboration between the PIs Fullerton and McMorran, international and industrial partners, and Harvey Mudd College to achieve a fundamental understanding of and ability to control the topological spin order in nano-structured magnetic materials and devices. The research is particularly interested in the design, manipulation and imaging of thin-film materials that exhibit complex 3-D topological states and defects such as chiral hybrid domain walls, chiral helixes, skyrmions, bi-skyrmions, antiskyrmions and hopfions. The morphology of the domains and defects depends sensitively on the underlying materials properties as well as on the application of magnetic fields, field history, and temperature where domains can arrange in metastable configurations including various topological defects. The team will develop and apply several recent methods in advanced electron microscopy to characterize the structure of these topological states, as well as their behavior under the influence of ultrafast fields. Summer curriculum is developed for the 7-12th grade and undergraduate levels to educate students on the use of nanoscale tools, and engage them in meaningful supervised research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many systems with slender structures exhibit complex behavior that is non-linear and counter intuitive. This Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering  (CDS&E) project combines machine learning and physics-based modeling to better understand their behavior and how to harness it to provide new capabilities.  The findings will enable new structures such as soft robots with new forms of motion and control for medical procedures or search and rescue activities. The knowledge gained may also enable the design of products such as stretchable electronics for health care, bio sensing and a broad range of consumer and industrial products. The project will develop a website and software repository to share the simulation tools with the research community. Educational materials including instructional videos will be developed for graduate courses and K-12 classes.<br/><br/>This project will enable the design of new materials and structures like soft kirigami composites and compressive buckling-induced micro-sized 3D architecture materials.

The overarching goal of this work is to explore the dynamic response of summer and winter Asian monsoon variability to changing external drivers, such as insolation, and internal climate variability which will contribute to improved understanding of large-scale hydrological variability in a vulnerable region. Specifically, the researchers will develop a new set of past climate records utilizing multiple environmental tracers (Carbon and Oxygen isotopes, trace elements such as Magnesium/Calcium, radiocarbon) in precisely dated speleothems spanning at least the last ~45 thousand years. Additionally, a detailed cave monitoring program will aid the interpretation of data obtained from the speleothems. The results will be integrated with other regional and global records of past climate variability and state-of-the-art climate model simulations to diagnose the dominant mechanisms driving hydroclimate variability on sub-decadal to millennial timescales in the MESA region. <br/><br/>The research will address the following specific objectives: (1) Determine the summer and fall/winter response of MSEA hydroclimate to orbital and millennial-scale forcing, (2) Determine the response of MSEA hydroclimate to decadal to multidecadal scale sea surface temperature variability, and (3) Synthesize data with other available records to elucidate the spatiotemporal patterns of MSEA hydroclimate, which, combined with paleoclimate model analyses, will allow us investigation of the dynamical mechanisms underlying summer and fall/winter monsoon variability. Speleothem oxygen isotope records from three study sites will serve as a proxy for summer monsoon intensity, dominated by the degree of upstream rainout over the Indian Ocean and trace element measurements will provide robust evidence for past variations in local water balance at each cave site, with Laos sites recording summer rainfall and Vietnam sites recording fall/winter rainfall.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include a better understanding of the monsoon dynamics and related hydroclimate in a vulnerable region by generating quantitative and well-dated multi-millennial climate records from speleothems.

This software, known as Bifrost, is currently in use at the Long Wavelength Array (LWA), a radio telescope for exploration of a broad scientific portfolio ranging from the study of Cosmic Dawn when the first stars and galaxies lit up the Universe, to understanding the properties of the Earth's ionosphere.  We are actively developing Bifrost to make it both more powerful and easier to use for other telescopes.  Eventually we aim for Bifrost to be available as a more general purpose framework that can be applied to research projects beyond astronomy. <br/><br/>About 5 years ago we adopted a commodity equipment design for the second LWA station (LWA-SV) which makes use of computing servers with GPUs to handle the data capture, beamforming, and correlation at the station level.  Previously these functions were taken on by dedicated hardware referred to as the Digital Processor. However, this custom-hardware design was expensive to build and maintain, lacks flexibility, and cannot be easily replicated for future LWA stations.  In contrast the commodity approach is easier to maintain, much more flexible and expandable, and can be readily adapted to new LWA stations.  We are engaged in a concentrated effort to improve the underpinnings of Bifrost.  This involves increasing the data rates that Bifrost is capable of handling, improving the application programming interface, and providing tools to make it easier for users to develop and test new pipelines.  Through this award we are working with collaborators to incorporate Bifrost in telescopes and instruments currently under development.  The  availability of Bifrost will increase the scientific return of not only radio astronomy but also other areas where high throughput data processing is needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goals of this research are to design new earth-abundant metal complexes that can replace photocatalysts based on precious metals and to elaborate new ways to selectively target individual carbon?hydrogen bonds for radical activation and functionalization. By replacing rare and toxic metal catalysts and stoichiometric, often halogen-containing, oxidants with naturally abundant alternatives, the project forms the basis for new ""green"" routes to pharmaceutical and materials that protect human health and the environment. In pursuit of these goals, the project also affords opportunities for high school STEM educator development, as well as outreach activities that increase public engagement and science literacy among groups that are traditionally underrepresented in chemistry.<br/><br/>Efforts to elaborate photoredox-active chromophores based on first row transition metals are challenged by short charge-transfer excited-state lifetimes that preclude bimetallic reactivity.

Central to this strategy is the capacity of new pincer complexes to support photolytic cobalt bond activation leading to extrusion of carbon based radicals, which are active for alkylation, fluoroalkylation, and arylation of (hetero)arenes.

Some chemical components that enter into subduction zones are released back to the oceans (as water or gas); others contribute to magmas in volcanoes (where they become part of the crust as igneous rocks or are released to the atmosphere as volcanic gases) and still others are transported all the way into the deep interior of the Earth. Understanding how elements and compounds are divided between the surface and the interior of Earth can provide important information about the regulation of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, the concentration of radioactive elements near the surface of the Earth, and the tendency of some volcanoes to erupt violently. This project uses the element boron, which is highly concentrated in seawater and ocean sediments compared to the interior of the Earth, to track the recycling of surface components through subduction zones. If we can measure the amount of boron entering into a subduction zone on the sea floor and how much boron is released by associated volcanoes and into the ocean, then we can calculate how much boron is recycled into the deep Earth. The workplan includes opportunities for intellectual exchange between collaborators in the United States, Italy, and Japan. Students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels will participate in and benefit from the collaborative exchange.<br/><br/>Subduction zones are the primary locus for recycling of crustal materials into the Earth?s mantle, with important implications for mantle and continental crustal evolution throughout Earth history. Subducted sediments in particular contribute volatiles, trace elements, and unique isotopic signatures to the oceans, the mantle, and arc magmas. Boron is both highly fluid mobile and isotopically fractionated during thermally-driven desorption and metamorphic dehydration, making it an excellent tracer for both sediment and fluids. In contrast, Rare Earth Elements (HREE) and High Field Strength Elements (HFSE) are generally immobile, making them good tracers of sediment and basalt provenance. By observing the co-variation of B, d11B, and HREE/HFSE concentrations in progressively dehydrated marine clays and subsidiary basalts within a unique sample suite from the Nankai margin, we propose to constrain 1) the initial variability in slab inputs to the trench within a well-constrained segment of a single subduction zone; and 2) the evolution of sediment and released fluid composition through progressive desorption and dehydration prior to entering the sub-arc region.

This project will improve our mathematical understanding of optimality principles and dynamics in several models of substantial current interest to researchers in a number of disciplines. These range from fluid dynamics and network routing to statistical sampling and data science to aerosol physics and animal ecology.  Optimal transport theory will be used in a novel way to model fluid mixture dynamics and understand how fluid surface singularities can form.

Contrary to prevailing wisdom that variability degrades the performance of inventory management strategies, very early evidence suggests that lead-time variability can, in certain cases, be used to advantage to produce strategies that reduce overall cost of inventory.   This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will provide further experimental evidence for understanding whether and how lead time uncertainty can be exploited to reduce inventory costs. The project will investigate how distributional information and variability in lead-time and demand patterns may yield new insights into adaptive approaches to inventory management that can dynamically adjust to changes in lead times.  <br/><br/>This project will thoroughly investigate the premise that variability can be effectively exploited in an adaptive fashion to develop data-driven algorithms that identify strategies to reduce overall cost of inventory. This stands in contrast with the vast majority of inventory literature, which is focused on explicit analytical methods that require assumptions on the (stationary) distribution of lead time and demand. These assumptions are often not supported in realistic inventory management scenarios.  This project examines realistic and general model settings, with the goal of identifying the key factors affecting the performance of new policies and quantifying this performance. While still very preliminary and experimental, the results of this project are expected to lead to testable hypotheses that could potentially have great implications for inventory theory and application and therefore broad practical effect.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of differential geometry is to study higher-dimensional shapes and their curvature. In particular, these concepts provide a mathematical framework for general relativity.  Geometric flows are a key tool in differential geometry.  The idea here is to take a geometric object and evolve it by a differential equation in order to smooth it out. These differential equations share common features with heat diffusion. However, the differential equations that arise in geometry tend to be nonlinear, which presents challenges in their analysis.  A main focus is to understand the behavior of these equations when the solution becomes singular, that is, when the curvature becomes very large.  An important problem is to classify the singularity models; these are the limiting shapes that occur at a singularity. Another major goal in geometry is to understand geometric inequalities.  A basic example is the isoperimetric inequality (which states that balls have smallest surface area among all shapes that enclose a given amount of volume), but many other types of inequalities are of importance in differential geometry.  The project also includes training of PhD students and mentoring of post-doctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The primary examples of geometric flows are the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. The mean curvature flow is the most natural evolution equation for a surface embedded in Euclidean space, while the Ricci flow is the most natural evolution equation for a Riemannian metric.  The Ricci flow has become an indispensable tool in differential geometry. Among other things, the Ricci flow lies at the heart of Perelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture. The PI will study what types of singularities can form under these evolution equations.  For example, it would be very interesting to understand whether a plane of multiplicity 2 can arise as a singularity model under the mean curvature flow.  In another direction, the PI will study problems related to geometric inequalities.  In particular, it would be very interesting to understand isoperimetric inequalities in negatively curved manifolds.  Moreover, many geometric inequalities come with an associated rigidity statement which characterizes the case of equality. The PI will study the near-equality case in such inequalities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These new structures, ""monoidal categories,"" can often be realized in purely graphical terms. In the last few years, this point of view has revealed some quite unexpected connections between very different parts of mathematics and physics. One example that plays a role in this project is the so-called Heisenberg category, which arose originally in algebra from thinking about symmetries between representations of the finite symmetric groups, but which is also connected to the infinite-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra, which has its origins in quantum mechanics. The funding of this project will lead to new understanding of classical problems in representation theory by taking advantage of this graphical approach, with potential applications both inside and outside of mathematics, including to finite group theory, combinatorics, Lie theory, knot theory, and theoretical physics.

The project aims to understand these objects by decomposing them into simpler pieces, embedding them into classical geometries, or approximating them by linear objects. Non-smooth analysis and geometry are important in many areas of pure and applied mathematics and computer science, since non-smooth problems arise in studying large data sets, in computational questions, and as limiting cases of smooth problems.

Currently, however, is it not fully understood why these environments are able to bury so much organic carbon, or how they will respond to future changes in sea level, land use, and climate. This project will investigate a mechanism that may help explain this carbon burial: organic matter sulfurization, the transformation and effective ?pickling? of sedimentary organic matter by sulfide. Its central aim is to understand what controls the extent of sulfurization in mangrove sediments, and to estimate the contribution of organic matter sulfurization to sediment carbon storage in different parts of the environment. By providing some of the first constraints on how, when, and where organic matter sulfurization happens in mangroves, the results of this work will guide decisionmakers managing coastal watersheds and carbon stocks in the face of land use, climate and sea level change. As part of this work, four undergraduate students and one PhD student at UC Santa Barbara will gain field and research experience. And, in collaboration with local groups associated with the field site, the team will produce a season of ?Ocean Solutions? podcast episodes related to conservation and human impacts of Caribbean mangroves. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to understand how microbial sulfur cycling affects organic matter preservation in vegetated coastal sediments, which have substantial leverage to impact the global carbon cycle on decadal to millennial timescales. It specifically investigates organic matter sulfurization, which can transform fresh, easily respired organic matter into recalcitrant, polymerized carbon stocks with long-term preservation potential. Although organic matter sulfurization is known to occur in mangrove sediments, the scale of its impact is essentially unknown.  A pair of field expeditions will be conducted at a mangrove forest on the southwestern coast of Florida. In the first field season, geochemical profiles will be used to quantify organic matter sulfurization in sediments and its relationships with carbon storage, iron mineralogy, and the characteristics of sedimentary organic matter inputs. In the second field season, cyclic voltammetry will be used to target redox dynamics at the millimeter scale. Laboratory experiments will be conducted to test the susceptibility of various local organic matter sources to sulfurization and characterize their sulfurized forms. Throughout, the project applies a holistic approach to sedimentary organic matter by characterizing the dissolved, lipid, protein/carbohydrate, and proto-kerogen pools with isotopic and spectroscopic techniques. This work will yield a first quantitative, mechanistic framework for predicting the extent of organic matter sulfurization in coastal vegetated habitats and its likely response to changes in ecology, land use, or sea level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is devoted to the development of classification algorithms for high-dimensional datasets consisting of distributions, and will focus both on their theoretical analysis and computational efficiency. To this end, the principal investigator will use the framework of optimal transport, which provides a natural way of comparing distributions. Students will be involved and trained in interdisciplinary aspects of this project.<br/><br/>This project applies knowledge from computational optimal transport, such as linear embeddings and regularized optimization, and machine learning algorithms, to study classification tasks for datasets consisting of distributions. The main goal is to develop approximation methods with guaranteed error bounds that also allow for algorithmic insights and efficient implementation. Open problems on approximation power, computational feasibility, and numerical analysis will be addressed. Specifically, the project addresses four fundamental questions that arise in the field: (1) What are the types of distributions that can be classified with traditional machine learning techniques through linear embeddings, and how does the choice of a regularizer affect accuracy? (2) How well can the Wasserstein distance and Wasserstein barycenters be approximated through linear embeddings using Euclidean distances? (3) Under which conditions can we guarantee separability with simple classifiers in the embedding space for disjoint classes of distributions? (4) How can we tailor our framework to address various applications, such as classifying structures in audio or video segments?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry has significant applications in coding, industrial control, computation, and theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as a piece of the fine structure of our universe. One focus in this project is Moduli theory, which studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often manifested as an algebraic variety in its own right, called a moduli space. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of ""organisms"" as itself being an ""organism"" is not just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. The other focus in this project is birational geometry, focusing here on resolution of singularities. Resolution of singularities is a fundamental procedure where ""bad"" points of an algebraic variety are removed and replaced by ""good"" points. This project includes research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI  will continue studying problems in birational geometry, focusing on resolution of singularities,  semistable reduction, and the geometry of stack theoretic birational modifications. The PI and collaborators will build on recently completed work to functorially resolve singularities of proper families of varieties; to study the geometry of weighted blowings up and more general stack-theoretic procedures; and to study subtle phenomena in positive characteristics. In addition, the PI will continue to study moduli spaces. The main foci are Moduli and arithmetic of subvarieties of families of abelian varieties,  aiming to extend recent non-degeneracy and uniformity results of rational points on curves to symmetric squares of curves and related constructions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there are many interesting questions in this field, in this project specific problems will be singled out whose resolution will lead to advanced insights into the subject. These problems are related to Thurston obstructions, the induced pull-back map on Teichmüller space, and the geometry of the visual sphere associated with an expanding Thurston map.  An important numerical invariant of these spheres will be studied, namely their Ahlfors regular conformal dimension.  A fundamental technical tool for this investigation is the notion of combinatorial modulus of path families.

These little understood equations belong to the area of mathematics known as gauge theory, which originates from physics and describes the dynamics of gauge fields, such as the electromagnetic field and other fields carrying fundamental forces of nature. The importance of gauge fields in pure mathematics stems from their relationship to the geometry of shapes known as manifolds. This leads to the second objective of this project, which is to apply the theory of generalized Seiberg-Witten equations to find new ways of distinguishing different manifolds from one another. The Principal Investigator (PI) is specifically interested in applications lying at the intersection of different areas of research, such as algebraic geometry (which studies manifolds described by equations), symplectic geometry (which studies manifolds related to classical mechanics), topology (which studies properties of manifolds which remain unchanged under deformations), and string theory (a branch of modern theoretical physics). In addition, the project's goal is to expose a broad audience, including graduate and undergraduate students, as well as researchers in other areas, to some of the ideas and techniques of gauge theory and geometry. As part of the project, the PI will organize seminars and minicourses for students and write expository notes on gauge theory aimed at non-specialists.<br/><br/><br/>This project will develop analytic foundations in the study of generalized Seiberg-Witten equations on three- and four-dimensional manifolds.

In recent years, there has been a lot of progress on the compactness problem for these equations, following groundbreaking work of Taubes. The first goal of the project is to solve the converse problem of describing the moduli spaces of solutions near the boundary. This will involve understanding singular solutions to the Fueter equation, a nonlinear generalization of the Dirac equation, which appears as the limit of rescallings of generalized Seiberg?Witten equations. In particular, little is at present known about deformation theory and gluing constructions for such singular sections, and making progress in this direction will involve developing new analytical tools for studying singular solutions of elliptic differential equations. The PI will apply this general theory to define a symplectic analog of the Pandharipande?Thomas invariants of Calabi?Yau threefolds. The invariant counts embedded pseudo-holomorphic curves with weights defined using moduli spaces of the ADHM Seiberg?Witten equations. A symplectic interpretation of the Pandharipande?Thomas invariant is likely to shed a new light on the Maulik?Nekrasov?Okounkov?Pandharipande conjecture, which remains one of the major open problems of enumerative geometry of Calabi?Yau threefolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is manifested as an abnormal muscle stiffness that causes pain and interferes with movement, impacting balance and daily functions. Evaluating the severity of spasticity is a crucial step in selecting appropriate treatments for patients to prevent progressive deformities. However, current clinical evaluations rely on ratings based on perception. The subjective ratings are known to be inconsistent and not sensitive and as such fail to accurately monitor the effects of medications or therapies. To facilitate better diagnosis, this project aims to deliver biomechanical metrics for evaluating spasticity with high accuracy through a portable sensor glove system. The sensitive, consistent measurements will allow clinicians to inspect whether a therapy effectively relieves spasticity symptoms. The portable system will also facilitate frequent remote assessments to enable timely interventions, reduce costs, and improve patient care. Throughout this duration of this project, the investigators and students will host annual AccessAbility Fair at Rady Children?s Hospital to provide demonstrations and to disseminate resources for local San Diego children with physical disabilities and conduct STEM outreach activities in local communities.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to capture the dynamic characteristics of spastic muscles through a multi-model sensor glove, in order to gain new insights into the physical mechanisms of spasticity. The clinicians would wear the sensor glove while carrying out standard evaluation maneuvers to measure a patient?s muscle resistance and movement trajectories. This wearable tool is compact and user friendly, unlike prior biomechanical devices that are complex to operate and limited by unwieldy, constraining sensors that pose safety and clinical adoption barriers. This project will carry out key feasibility studies to monitor patient cohorts undergoing routine treatments. The first objective is to characterize spastic muscles through biomechanical models, and thereby quantitatively connect the effects of treatments to changes in specific biomechanical properties. The research will lead to knowledge concerning which biomechanical properties are the most relevant for establishing an objective scale to track the management of spasticity over time.  The second objective is to improve measurement standardization through supervised machine learning in combination with a robotic standard, to mitigate artifacts and maximize the inter- and intra-rater consistency in monitoring spasticity. The third objective is to facilitate point-of-care measurements by caregivers, to enable at-home assessment that closely tracks the patients? response to therapies outside of clinical visits. The system user interface and analysis algorithms will be developed in close collaboration with the rehabilitation clinician team and caregivers, to dismantle the barriers to practical clinical use and facilitate telemedicine in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ubiquity of plastics in our daily lives presents challenges due their potential threats to the environment and natural habitats arising from their low recyclability. Conventional thermoset polymers, whose attractive physical and mechanical properties make them important structural materials, are particularly insidious. The irreversible crosslinking at the molecular level seriously impedes their reprocessing and recycling ability. Novel vitrimer chemistries offer exciting avenues to develop mechanically robust, recyclable thermosets. However, predicting the emergence of defects (microstructure) during reprocessing and their impact on the mechanical characteristics (property) is difficult. The challenge is rooted in unraveling the damage processes associated with the statistics of microscale defect structures resulting from vitrimer chemo-mechanics at various length-scales and time-scales. The research project addresses these principal issues via novel multiscale computational mechanics. Its technological relevance is rooted in the need for a predictive modeling and simulation framework to enable damage-tolerant vitrimers for structural applications. The research program is integrated into a broader educational goal of creating an immersive learning experience at two levels: (i) underrepresented student groups including students with disabilities, (ii) an integration of granular art in education (K-12), and (iii) development of a graduate course on the microstructure-sensitive failure mechanics of materials. <br/><br/>Transesterification based covalent adaptive network polymers (vitrimers) derive their reprocessing ability via bond exchange reaction chemistry. An attractive approach to recycling such vitrimers involves pulverizing them into granular powders and reprocessing them via thermomechanical compaction. During this process, individual particles undergo non-linear, dissipative deformation, and welding at inter-particle contact regions through novel chemo-mechanical healing processes. The resulting new solid embodies fingerprints of recycling in the form of micromechanical defect populations. These defect microstructures redefine their viscoelastic stiffening, strengthening, and damage tolerance, which depends on the mechanics at multiple length-scales: (i) granular thermo-chemo-mechanics of healing; (ii) defect micromechanics of damage evolution, and (iii) continuum micromechanics of recycled components. This project will address fundamental questions associated with the mechanics of recycled thermosets via a multiscale computational mechanics platform: (a) at the mesoscale, by discrete element modeling and simulation of granular ensembles endowed with vitrimers chemo-mechanics to quantify emergent statistics of the defect-damage linkages, and (b) at the macroscale, by formulating and computationally implementing a micromechanically informed statistical viscoelastic damage mechanics.

These materials have a predicted flavor SU(3) symmetry, of particular interest because of the analogy to the quark model in particle physics, and this symmetry is extremely rare in condensed matter systems. The project experimentally tests predictions for novel tunable Kondo effects and Coulomb blockade behavior emerging from this symmetry. The project also performs experiments aimed at manipulating these flavor states to develop qudits towards quantum information processing based on flavortronics.

The goal of algebraic topology is to systematically build a connection between algebraic objects like numbers and geometric objects like spaces. This connection allows a two-way flow of information, with algebraic invariants distinguishing spaces and topological methods informing algebraic problems. Starting from foundational work of Quillen, algebraic and algebraic geometry data like formal groups gives rise to new invariants for spaces with striking properties. This project combines this classical thread with much more recent developments coming from equivariant algebraic topology. ""Equivariant algebraic topology"" remembers a collection of symmetries inherent in a space as part of the data, systematically grouping spaces with the same symmetries, and the numbers and invariants produced must reflect this. This extra structure provides more nuanced computations, giving more information about how the classically described invariants change under symmetries. Equivariant algebraic topology has experienced a renaissance recently due to the solution by the PI, Hopkins, and Ravenel to the Kervaire Invariant One problem, one of the oldest outstanding problems in algebraic topology. The solution introduced a host of new constructions and techniques that have striking ramifications in classical and equivariant algebraic topology, and this project focuses on unpacking some of these new constructions, exploring their ramifications in classically studied computations, and describing what they mean for algebraic topology in general. The PI intends to create more opportunities for students who do not see themselves as ""math people"" to connect with algebra and geometry concepts by having the students design and build physical models.

The project focuses mainly on concrete computations (both of chromatically meaningful quotients of hyperreal bordism and of more traditional objects like the dual Steenrod algebra), while also studying more abstract questions of what kinds of multiplicative structures we can see. Finally, an application of all of this machinery to the classical questions of orientability of vector bundles is explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the last decade the PI has developed a new set of mathematical tools called decouplings to measure this extent of interaction. While these tools were initially intended for certain questions about differential equations, they have also led to important breakthroughs in number theory. More precisely, Diophantine equations are systems of polynomial equations involving whole numbers with potentially complicated solutions. Mathematicians are interested in counting the number of solutions to such systems.  Unlike waves, numbers do not oscillate, at least not in an obvious manner, but one can think of numbers as frequencies, and thus associate them to waves.  In this way, questions related to counting the number of solutions to Diophantine systems can be rephrased in the language of quantifying wave interferences. The project will further extend the scope of decouplings towards the resolution of fundamental problems in harmonic analysis and number theory. New tools will be developed that will be accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community. In addition, the Principal Investigator will organize summer schools and workshops that will educate both young researchers and experts from other areas of mathematics about the applicability of decouplings.<br/><br/>Decouplings have proved successful in addressing a wide range of problems in such diverse areas as number theory, partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. Through the project a further expansion is planned of the applicability of these methods in new directions. One important circle of questions that remain to be addressed concerns the decoupling inequalities for curves on small spatial balls. An investigation of a new phenomenon called large cap decoupling will further be sought after. Large cap decoupling is concerned with square root cancellation for coarser partitions of manifolds. A third part of the project is devoted to investigating restrictions of exponential sums to submanifolds of tori.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A more sustainable approach is to use existing materials in new ways.  For example, the high cost of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) and its inherent stability strongly favor end-of-use recycling and/or upcycling as opposed to landfilling. In this project, the widely valued approach of compatibilizing polymers in blends to address the critical economic and environmental sustainability needs of our society will be accomplished by performing simple chemical modifications on existing feedstocks of PEEK.  Specifically, a new physical approach will be used to create blocky copolymers that are known to be beneficial in polymer blends by selectively modifying specific sequences of units along the chains of commercially available polymers.  The blocky PEEK polymers will be targeted toward new blends of PEEK with other valuable polymers as a means to eliminate waste and upcycle PEEK to new materials with synergistic enhancements in properties. These same polymers will also be used to facilitate strong bonds between PEEK and solid fillers in the formation of new composites with enhanced mechanical properties. With respect to the grand challenges facing our society, this project will provide cost-effective, environmentally friendly, readily available materials alternatives needed to meet critical demands for advanced materials in a wide range of commercially relevant technologies.  The nature of research activities in this project, involving close collaboration between academic and industrial laboratories, will provide broadly interdisciplinary training to a diverse community of researchers and students, including underrepresented groups.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The widespread commercial application of block copolymers as blend compatibilizers and fiber sizings is limited by the expensive and rigorous polymerization methods needed to control the sequence of comonomers in the form of discrete blocks.  As a transformative approach, the PIs propose a facile, physical polymer chemistry alternative to yield controlled blocky microstructures in poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) via post-polymerization functionalizations in a heterogeneous, semi-crystalline, gel state. The fundamental focus of this project will be on pushing the limits of blockiness that is achievable with this new process, expanding the synthetic toolbox of functionalization chemistries for targeted interfacial interactions/reactions, and understanding the molecular-level impact of blocky functionalization on phase behavior and interfacial interactions in high-performance polymer blends and composites. This academic-industrial collaboration is poised to address the grand challenge of forming interfacially active copolymers for PEEK-based blends and composites, with compatibilization efficiencies rivaling that observed with conventional segmented block copolymers.  The overall fundamental goal of this project is to understand the role of the compatibilizer microstructure (blocky vs. random) on interfacial properties in multiphase systems. The interdisciplinary nature of research activities in this project, ranging from pure chemistry, materials recyclability, to macromolecular engineering, will provide a plethora of educational opportunities to a diverse community of citizens and researchers eager to contribute to our nation?s leadership in ensuring a healthier, more sustainable global society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indoor localization faces a number of challenges in the radio propagation environment, including the multipath effect, shadowing, fading, and delay distortion. To tackle the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) indoor environment, fingerprinting based wireless localization methods using deep neural networks (DNN) have been proposed. However, a data-driven only approach using DNN may perform poorly in adversarial IoT environments (e.g., wireless jamming). Specifically, DNN models are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples generated by introducing a subtle perturbation. Thus, the primary aim of the proposed research is to develop robust solutions for wireless localization in adversarial IoT environments, which fills in the gap between wireless localization accuracy and robustness. Particularly, we consider adversarial machine learning for wireless localization in IoT environments. The successful completion of this project will significantly improve the state-of-the-art of wireless localization and enable robust IoT applications. The project's educational plan includes developing a new graduate-level course on deep learning for wireless IoT systems and enhancing various core undergraduate and graduate-level courses. Also, the project strives to broaden participation from under-represented groups in research and will continue to greatly strengthen such efforts throughout the project years.<br/><br/>The project research agenda is composed of two closely integrated research thrusts. In Thrust I, this project will use adversarial deep learning for indoor localization in a way that leverages adversarial training in the offline stage to improve the robustness of the deep network, thus alleviating the threat of the adversarial example attacks on wireless data. This project will consider two wireless localization tasks: adversarial examples for wireless localization in black-box attacks and unsupervised learning for adversarial examples detection. In Thrust II,  this project will combine deep learning and Gaussian processes for uncertain location estimation, to improve robustness for wireless localization algorithms. Specifically, this project will exploit uncertainty location estimation with deep Gaussian process against both white-box and black-box attacks. Also, this project will model and analyze the fundamental limits and robustness of wireless localization. For all the proposed tasks in the two thrusts, this project will develop mathematical models and solution algorithms. The proposed algorithms will be implemented with wireless IoT devices/platforms (e.g., Wi-Fi, RFID, and LoRa), and validated with extensive experiments in representative indoor environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The defining characteristics of the Earth, such as oceans, continents, life, and plate tectonics are likely to have appeared for the first time on the Hadean eon. It thus seems inevitable that their emergence would have been affected by these early collisions, though to what extent they were affected remains an open question. In particular, little understood are the effects of these collisions on the internal evolution of the Earth.  Collisions are thought to have contributed significantly to the abundance of highly iron-loving elements (e.g., Au, Ir, Ru) in the Earth?s mantle, but the details of their delivery through impacts are not fully understood due to complex mixing processes that arise when a projectile collides with the early Earth. In addition, it is not well-understood how the long-term evolution of the Earth?s mantle could have responded to the injection of materials derived from the impactors. This project introduces an innovative computational approach that combines impact simulations with models that explore the long-term evolution of the Earth?s interior to quantify the delivery of highly iron-loving elements, their distribution in the mantle, and the total mass of late accreted materials. These results allow for an increased understanding of the Hadean Earth surface environment. Moreover, the connections between short-term impact dynamics and long-term mantle dynamics may shed light on the origin of anomalies in the mantle (such as the large low-shear-velocity provinces, which are the most significant anomalies on the deep mantle), the dynamics of mantle plumes, and the history of the geomagnetic field. This project also provides support for interdisciplinary training of a graduate student, an undergraduate internship where the Southwest Research Institute will host 1-2 geophysics major from Yale University, and a series of movies that visualize planetesimal impacts and mantle dynamics for education outreach.<br/><br/>The geophysical evolution of Hadean Earth was controlled by large-scale collisions and mantle dynamics, but the interplay of these processes remains largely unexplored. The Earth?s protracted bombardment of leftover planetesimals after the Moon-forming giant impact, called ?late accretion?, is supported by the lunar cratering record and is required to explain the abundance of as well as the chondritic proportions of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the present-day mantle. Recently, based on impact simulations with smooth-particle hydrodynamics (SPH), the late accreted mass has been suggested to be two to five times higher than previously thought, because the metallic cores of large differentiated planetesimals, where the bulk of HSEs reside, are not efficiently mixed into the mantle. Such an upward revision of late accreted mass could dramatically modify our understanding of the Hadean Earth. This suggestion based on SPH simulations is, however, still provisional because important complications arising from long-term mantle dynamics are not incorporated. Thus, the delivery of HSEs, their distribution in the mantle, and the total mass of the late accretion are still wide-open questions, with important consequences on the Hadean Earth surface environment. This project aims to achieve the following two major objectives: (1) to quantify the fate of differentiated planetesimal cores during impacts, by re-evaluating SPH simulations including the physics of fragmentation, and (2) to understand the long-term fate of fragmented metallic blobs by conducting systematic mantle mixing simulations. The primary goal of this project is to determine the absolute scale of planetesimal impact history, but achieving this goal will also help to address a wide range of important questions, from the habitability of the early Earth to the origin of deep geochemical reservoirs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rates of greenhouse gas release from these wetlands may increase with warming and offset their ability to sequester carbon. By studying the chemical and microbiological processes in wetland sediments over space and time, predictions of the effects of climate change on these critical habitats will be possible. Documentation of the ecological importance of this region via photography will demonstrate the value of wetlands to a broad audience.<br/><br/>The drivers of biogeochemical activity that dictate the emissions of carbon dioxide and methane in small, inland waters are poorly constrained, yet processes in these water bodies play an oversized role in understanding climate change. One process that is poorly understood is the role of chemical reactions in mediating carbon dioxide and methane formation in small lakes and wetlands, especially the abiotic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the sediment-water interface (SWI). The hypothesis for this project is that the reaction of reduced soluble and particulate forms of iron, sulfur, and carbon with trace level oxygen to form ROS at the SWI is an under-appreciated, yet critical, control on microbiological activity and the cycling of carbon in small inland water bodies. Using a combination of field work in the prairie pothole region of North Dakota, controlled laboratory experiments, and mesocosm studies, this work will 1) identify the geochemical drivers of ROS generation at the SWI, 2) determine spatiotemporal patterns of linked pore water chemistry and ROS at the SWI, and 3) track the generation of specific labile carbon substrates produced through ROS-DOM reactions that affect rates of carbon mineralization and methane production in small lake and wetland sediments. A combination of in situ voltammetry measurements, detailed characterization of dissolved and particulate organic matter, iron, and sulfur species, and microbial -omics analyses will be used to understand the coupled biogeochemical processes. A key component of this work is understanding how abiotic ROS driven reactions at the sediment-water interface lead to turnover of terminal electron acceptors and generation of labile microbial substrates. Establishing a baseline understanding of these processes is needed to predict changes in carbon dioxide and methane fluxes under different climate scenarios. The collected data will enable understanding of how biogeochemical cycles are maintained through coupled abiotic/biotic pathways, and how these processes impact carbon cycling in aquatic environments. This approach is also applicable to other systems and the cycling of other elements, such as nitrogen, which may be especially important in urban wetland regions. The societal benefit will be improved understanding of processes that influence, and are influenced by, climate change. To reach as broad an audience as possible regarding the importance of this region, a photographer will document the landscape and its ecological function during field sampling trips.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the challenges facing applied mathematics and probability is to obtain accurate and provably efficient methods to approximate and simulate a range of complex systems using probabilistic models. The primary purpose of this research is to rigorously investigate problems related to multiscale systems, rare events, and related simulation methods. The principal investigator (PI) is interested in studying stochastic dynamical systems that may have different time scales and quantifying related events that may be rare on a given time scale but can have important consequences for the system itself. The questions of interest in this project are motivated both by fundamental mathematical questions and by a broad array of questions in other branches of science.  Examples range from estimation of rare event probabilities in chemical physics, hydrodynamics, coupled chemical reactions with spatially-dependent diffusion, to population genetics and opinion dynamics. This research project is integrated with an educational program that is designed to help in the training of undergraduate and graduate students in applied mathematics, physics, engineering, and chemistry in the exploration of rare events, multiscale processes and their analysis and simulation.<br/><br/>The PI is interested in the large deviations regime (tail events) as well as in the moderate deviations regime (the gap between the typical center and the tail of the distribution). Due to the lack of explicit solutions, one has to rely on approximation and simulation methods and for this reason rigorous development of provably efficient approximation methods and simulation Monte Carlo methods is essential. In a closely related direction, the PI develops a rigorous theory of metastability for infinite dimensional dynamical systems that may have multiple scales, interacting with the rare events of interest. Moreover, the PI is interested in the effect of multiple scales on tail events associated to interacting particle systems. Systems of interacting diffusions arise in many areas of science, theory of random matrices, mathematical biology, neural networks in machine learning and optimization, construction of Kahler-Einstein metrics, opinion dynamics, finance, and engineering. The proposed work leads to the development of a rigorous mathematical framework that allows to design provably efficient algorithms associated to modeling of rare events.

The project seeks to understand the singularities of algebraic varieties---places where the shape is pinched or folded over on itself.

The goal is to find sharp lower bounds, classify the singularities achieving that lower bound, and apply these results to open problems in the field. More specifically, a first direction is to prove general lower bounds on F-pure threshold in terms of other invariants, such as multiplicity, and then identify the varieties??extremal singularities?? achieving those bounds. Next, the aim is to classify Frobenius forms, which are the ?extremal singularities? for a certain lower bound on F-pure threshold in the homogeneous case.  A third direction is to advance progress on a conjecture of Kleiman and Piene characterizing hypersurfaces whose Gauss maps are extremal in certain ways, using properties of Frobenius forms.

This project?s aim is to develop a practical approach to interactive parallel applications.  The project?s novelty, in addition to focusing on this under-studied intersection of parallelism and interaction, is that it follows an end-to-end methodology that brings together many areas of computer science and bridges theory with practice.  The project has the potential to impact the design of several application areas that require large-scale interactive applications, including web services, desktop clients for CAD/CAM, games, and a variety of mobile applications.  <br/><br/>This research?s end-to-end goals require advances in type systems, programming languages, scheduling theory, and runtime systems.

This calculus will equip a fully general formal programming language based on Church's Lambda Calculus with a cost semantics, making it possible 1) to express interactive parallel applications and 2) to reason about the throughput and responsiveness of the programs. A type system will ensure the absence of thorny bugs such as priority inversions that can prevent establishing responsiveness guarantees. The investigators will prove that this calculus is realizable by developing scheduling algorithms that can faithfully match the cost semantics so as to guarantee the desired performance criteria.  On the practical side, the project team will extend Cilk, a C-based parallel programming language, to support interactive parallel applications.

These include (1) data-poisoning attacks in machine learning (ML), where even a small fraction of adversarial data inserted by malicious users can substantially degrade the quality of the ML system, and (2) exploratory analysis of scientific datasets (e.g., in biology), where systematic errors can create structured corruptions that require painstaking effort to detect. To address these challenges, there is a real need to develop efficient robust learning algorithms -- methods whose performance is stable to deviations from the idealized assumptions about the input data. The precise form of these deviations is problem-specific and gives rise to various notions of robustness. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a general algorithmic theory of high-dimensional robust statistics and learning. A crucial component of the project involves building bridges between different communities, by organizing interdisciplinary workshops, and writing a new graduate textbook on the topic. Moreover, the investigators are mentoring undergraduate students and design new data-centric courses integrating research and teaching.<br/><br/>The technical core of this project consists of two interrelated thrusts: (1) List-Decodable Learning and Mixture Models: The majority of recent literature in algorithmic high-dimensional robust learning focuses on the setting where the clean data is the majority of the dataset. List-decodable learning is a relaxed notion of learning capturing the regime where the clean data is a minority of the input dataset, and can be used to model important data-science applications, such as crowdsourcing with a majority of unreliable respondents and learning-mixture models.  The project is developing a unified theory with the goal of uncovering which distributional parameters can be efficiently list-decoded, and leveraging this theory to understand the complexity of learning mixture models. (2) Robust Supervised Learning of Geometric Concepts: The goal of supervised learning is to infer a function from a collection of labeled observations. Supervised learning has traditionally been concerned with the problem of generalizing from a set of correctly labeled examples. In many realistic scenarios, a fraction of the points and/or labels may be corrupted by noise, e.g., due to sensor errors or adversarial data poisoning.

Determining the best treatment options for waste streams, economically, environmentally, and socially for any given municipality is a complex decision dependent upon existing infrastructure, available funds, and local policy goals such as climate action plans. It is very difficult to evaluate options without the assistance of mathematical modeling to represent these systems, often referred to as decision support tools (DSTs). DSTs help to facilitate identification of the best solution given the characteristics of the waste stream, the existing infrastructure, specific policy goals in a given location. However, the tools can be challenging for nonexperts to use, and with the rapidly changing waste management landscape, they need updates to represent emerging waste management options and expand decisions beyond one or two metrics. This work engages stakeholders early and throughout the project to increase shared understanding of a widely used DST called the Solid Waste Optimization Life-Cycle Framework (SWOLF) and learn about the short- and longer-term targets for the stakeholders. This knowledge shapes technologies added to SWOLF as well as shape scenario analysis to best serve these stakeholders. SWOLF represents waste management options from a life cycle perspective; that is, the materials and energy flow across the entire chain of operations rather than just at the facility level and applies optimization techniques to allow for consideration of multiple objectives, in this case cost, carbon, and nutrients. Overall, this project provides better DSTs as well as uncover better approaches to developing DSTs that are more accessible to end users.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this work is to transform decision-making toward environmentally, economically, and socially optimized waste management by improving model development through early and frequent engagement with stakeholders. Determining the best treatment options for waste streams, economically, environmentally, and socially for any given municipality is a complex decision dependent upon existing infrastructure, available funds, and local policy goals, e.g., climate action plans. Decision support tools exist for waste management; however, even the best among them have need for inclusion of ability to model novel management options and social impacts. In particular, these existing tools generally address waste management decisions with respect to a single objective, such as minimizing cost or emissions, and do not reflect the reality that decision makers need to select waste management alternatives on the basis of multiple, conflicting criteria. An ?alternative? waste management approach in this context is multi-faceted, consisting of a mix of potential investments in technologies, logistics resources, and manpower, which further argues for a systems modeling approach to addressing such questions. The project uses and enhances the Solid Waste Optimization Life-Cycle Framework (SWOLF) model for analysis of waste management strategies: (1) To identify mixes of strategies that optimize stakeholders? objectives with respect to cost savings, greenhouse gas reductions, and social impacts. (2) To create life cycle inventory (LCI) data for novel waste management options and integrate these into SWOLF expanding the set of SWOLF environmental and economic objectives to include an option for social benefit maximization. (3) The project?s final modeling extension integrates the enhanced SWOLF model into a multi-objective optimization framework that identifies the efficient frontier of candidate solutions (across economic, environmental, and social objectives), and then helps direct a stakeholder to its preferred solution along that frontier. Using this extended modeling framework, waste management system analysis is applied using stakeholder-identified variables, metrics, and decision-making criteria. The intellectual merit of this project includes improving communication strategies between stakeholders and modelers, development of LCI data for novel waste treatment processes, improved multi-objective optimization modeling capacity for solid waste management, and waste management systems analysis tailored to stakeholders? geography and situation. The broader impacts of this project include undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral mentoring, networking across three academic institutions, and collaborating with a variety of stakeholders. Further, through model-presentation workshops the project improves the broader research communities? ability to create impact models and help waste management. The workshops also allow sustainability professionals make informed and aligned decisions based on their resources and goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are synthesized in specific geometries to enable selective and targeted interactions, while objects such as screws and rotors convert rotational motion to linear force. However, there are very few examples of chiral materials with nanoscale or mesoscale dimensions. Materials at these length scales are particularly important for interactions with polarized light. Chiral molecules absorb different polarization states of light to different extents, the effect is orders of magnitude stronger in appropriately designed nanostructures. The detection of polarized light is integral to sensors and imaging systems, and the generation of circularly polarized light is essential to the development of stereoscopic displays, of anti-counterfeiting security, and of quantum optical circuits. This project focuses on the fundamentals of the design, fabrication, and characterization of nanostructured materials to control the absorption and emission of circularly polarized light by creating new nanostructures comprised of light-emitting nanocrystals. The project also advances the fields of nanopatterning and fabrication. The research conducted will train students in photonics, nanotechnology, and materials characterization.

Rates of greenhouse gas release from these wetlands may increase with warming and offset their ability to sequester carbon. By studying the chemical and microbiological processes in wetland sediments over space and time, predictions of the effects of climate change on these critical habitats will be possible. Documentation of the ecological importance of this region via photography will demonstrate the value of wetlands to a broad audience.<br/><br/>The drivers of biogeochemical activity that dictate the emissions of carbon dioxide and methane in small, inland waters are poorly constrained, yet processes in these water bodies play an oversized role in understanding climate change. One process that is poorly understood is the role of chemical reactions in mediating carbon dioxide and methane formation in small lakes and wetlands, especially the abiotic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the sediment-water interface (SWI). The hypothesis for this project is that the reaction of reduced soluble and particulate forms of iron, sulfur, and carbon with trace level oxygen to form ROS at the SWI is an under-appreciated, yet critical, control on microbiological activity and the cycling of carbon in small inland water bodies. Using a combination of field work in the prairie pothole region of North Dakota, controlled laboratory experiments, and mesocosm studies, this work will 1) identify the geochemical drivers of ROS generation at the SWI, 2) determine spatiotemporal patterns of linked pore water chemistry and ROS at the SWI, and 3) track the generation of specific labile carbon substrates produced through ROS-DOM reactions that affect rates of carbon mineralization and methane production in small lake and wetland sediments. A combination of in situ voltammetry measurements, detailed characterization of dissolved and particulate organic matter, iron, and sulfur species, and microbial -omics analyses will be used to understand the coupled biogeochemical processes. A key component of this work is understanding how abiotic ROS driven reactions at the sediment-water interface lead to turnover of terminal electron acceptors and generation of labile microbial substrates. Establishing a baseline understanding of these processes is needed to predict changes in carbon dioxide and methane fluxes under different climate scenarios. The collected data will enable understanding of how biogeochemical cycles are maintained through coupled abiotic/biotic pathways, and how these processes impact carbon cycling in aquatic environments. This approach is also applicable to other systems and the cycling of other elements, such as nitrogen, which may be especially important in urban wetland regions. The societal benefit will be improved understanding of processes that influence, and are influenced by, climate change. To reach as broad an audience as possible regarding the importance of this region, a photographer will document the landscape and its ecological function during field sampling trips.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research scale photovoltaic cells based on HPs display record power conversion efficiencies that are on par with the most widely used photovoltaic material, silicon, but can be produced at a fraction of the cost of silicon photovoltaics. Although HPs have similar efficiencies to silicon, there are two major barriers to commercialization and wide scale deployment ? inadequate stability and the presence of lead (Pb), a well-known toxic element. Reduced dimensionality HPs, which are a class of HPs where the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite structure is broken into 2D sheets by bulky organic cations, are promising materials for improving stability and enabling the replacement of Pb with tin (Sn), which is much less toxic. At present, photovoltaic devices based on reduced dimensionality HPs show significantly lower performance than their 3D counterparts, while Sn-based HPs also underperform their Pb-based counterparts. This project develops new reduced dimensionality HPs, with a stronger focus on the less toxic Sn-based materials, and determines key relationships between spacer structure and material properties, thus providing the understanding necessary to accelerate material development for more stable and less toxic photovoltaics and light emitting diodes. The research team promotes STEM education and interest at the middle and high school levels while emphasizing participation of traditionally underrepresented groups. This goal relies largely on an annual workshop for middle and high-school teachers from around Kentucky, where teachers conduct experiments in the organic electronics fabrication laboratory at the University of Kentucky and leave with the materials required to make dye sensitized solar cells with their middle and high school classes.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The performance of reduced dimensionality HPs is limited by their high exciton binding energies and poor electronic transport relative to their 3D counterparts, while the development of Sn-based HPs in general is limited by defect states resulting from Sn oxidation. Currently, it is hard to predict how molecular parameters of the spacer molecule, such as electrostatics, polarizability, or size, influence the optical and electronic properties of reduced dimensionality HPs. In part, these predictions are difficult because fundamental relationships between the molecular parameters of the spacer molecule and the ionization energy, electron affinity, and exciton binding energy of the reduced dimensionality HPs are largely unexplored. However, these parameters are critical to designing materials and device structures for photovoltaics and light emitting diodes. This research project systematically probes how the spacer molecule?s structure impacts these important material properties as well as stability, charge-carrier transport, and photovoltaic performance in both Pb- and Sn-based reduced dimensionality HPs. The project uses low-energy ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopies to uncover critical relationships between spacer structure, crystal structure, ionization energy, and electron affinity in reduced dimensionality HPs. Next, the research focuses on how the spacer structure influences exciton binding energies in reduced dimensionality HPs and uses this knowledge to design materials with lower exciton binding energies. Third, spacer molecules are designed to inhibit Sn(II) oxidation and thereby provide a potential route for developing improved Sn-based HPs. Finally, selected reduced dimensionality HPs are incorporated into photovoltaic devices to determine how material properties such as exciton binding energies impact photovoltaic performance. Charge-carrier mobility measurements are conducted to establish more complete structure-property relationships that help to advance both material and device design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physicists and mathematicians are only beginning to understand a vast array of quantum phases of matter: classes of systems that may look different microscopically but share common macroscopic properties. This project aims to  solidify the connection between topological phases of matter as thought of by condensed matter physicists and their conjectured mathematical classification. The intended approach to this problem is expected to have immediate applications to condensed matter physics and quantum information science via new examples of topological phases and the development of new theoretical methods. The award will also contribute to US workforce development through the training of graduate students. <br/><br/>The principal scientific goal of this project is to use algebraic quantum mechanics to develop a framework to study the relationship between condensed matter physics and topology. In condensed matter physics quantum systems equipped with a time evolution or Hamiltonian are often presented using lattice models: these are simplified models of a material at low temperature. When the energy gap of a quantum system is non-zero, some properties are robust to deformations of the system, leading to the notion of equivalence classes of systems known as gapped phases of matter. Some gapped phases, called invertible, are believed to be well approximated by topological quantum field theories, although this connection is not understood rigorously. However, Kitaev has proposed a more fundamental connection between topology and condensed matter physics, suggesting that invertible gapped phases are classified by a loop-spectrum in the sense of homotopy theory. The project team will make this precise by introducing  a cohomology theory of invertible gapped phases. Physically, this corresponds to studying quantum systems with parameters that are allowed to vary, with some predetermined restrictions and without changing the fundamental properties of the system. This award supports investigations aimed toward constructing this theory and answering related fundamental questions in the mathematical physics of gapped phases of matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting materials moreover promise to possess properties needed for next-generation electronics and quantum electronics technologies, important for national defense and prosperity. The impact of the supported research and science, and of research and science in general, will be communicated to the public by the researchers through planned outreach activities, for example via the University of Wisconsin?s Badger Talks initiative. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>Molecules are the ultimate nanostructures. Their size, shape, and composition can be nearly infinitely tuned, and exact replicas can be created on a massively parallel scale. Molecules? physical, electrical, and optical properties can be vastly tailored ? to realize insulating, semiconducting, and metallic behaviors and manipulate photons from the ultraviolet to the infrared. In this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, we will create and explore analogs to molecules ? specifically analogs to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules ? that are not free but covalently embedded, in-plane, in crystalline monolayer sheets of insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). While nanoscale domains of carbon have been fabricated from the top-down in h-BN previously, these domains have been relatively large and/or disordered in shape and size, and none have been defined with molecular precision. Here, atomically precise carbon domains will be realized, from the bottom-up, by using PAH molecules themselves to create them. The embedded PAHs will offer the exactness and tunablility of conventional molecules but in a planar, immobilized, and atomically thin form. Molecularly embedded h-BN sheets promise phenomena not previously possible ? including exceptionally thin materials with exact pores of widely tunable size and shape (through selective carbon etching) for molecular sequencing or sieving applications, h-BN sheets (conventionally insulating) with functional semiconducting dopants, and immobilized single molecules that are individually addressable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop alternative tools, or in case they do not exist to prove h-principle type results asserting that whatever is not prohibited by holomorphic curve method is, in fact, possible. The main objectives of the project are: 1) Completion of the arborealization program of simplification of singularities of Lagrangian skeleta of Weinstein manifolds, and,  in particular, establishing the combinatorial notion of arboreal homotopy, i.e., finding the minimal set of Reidemeister type moves necessary and sufficient to connect  two arboreal skeleta of homotopic Weinstein structures; 2) Finding an  appropriate notion of overtwistedness for conformal symplectic structures and proving the corresponding parametric h-principle; 3) Finding a generalization of the notion of  arboreal singularities applicable to general Weinstein manifolds beyond the polarized case; 4) Finding conditions on a codimension 1 foliation  to admit a  leafwise conformal symplectic structure; explorations of this condition  for the problem of deformation of foliations into contact structures; and 5) Developing effective invariants for open contact manifolds and proving surgery type formulas for their computations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this work is to explore the dynamic response of summer and winter Asian monsoon variability to changing external drivers, such as insolation, and internal climate variability which will contribute to improved understanding of large-scale hydrological variability in a vulnerable region. Specifically, the researchers will develop a new set of past climate records utilizing multiple environmental tracers (Carbon and Oxygen isotopes, trace elements such as Magnesium/Calcium, radiocarbon) in precisely dated speleothems spanning at least the last ~45 thousand years. Additionally, a detailed cave monitoring program will aid the interpretation of data obtained from the speleothems. The results will be integrated with other regional and global records of past climate variability and state-of-the-art climate model simulations to diagnose the dominant mechanisms driving hydroclimate variability on sub-decadal to millennial timescales in the MESA region. <br/><br/>The research will address the following specific objectives: (1) Determine the summer and fall/winter response of MSEA hydroclimate to orbital and millennial-scale forcing, (2) Determine the response of MSEA hydroclimate to decadal to multidecadal scale sea surface temperature variability, and (3) Synthesize data with other available records to elucidate the spatiotemporal patterns of MSEA hydroclimate, which, combined with paleoclimate model analyses, will allow us investigation of the dynamical mechanisms underlying summer and fall/winter monsoon variability. Speleothem oxygen isotope records from three study sites will serve as a proxy for summer monsoon intensity, dominated by the degree of upstream rainout over the Indian Ocean and trace element measurements will provide robust evidence for past variations in local water balance at each cave site, with Laos sites recording summer rainfall and Vietnam sites recording fall/winter rainfall.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include a better understanding of the monsoon dynamics and related hydroclimate in a vulnerable region by generating quantitative and well-dated multi-millennial climate records from speleothems.

This project proposes several accurate and efficient algorithms to solve the phase field models and to further explore the connections between different areas.

This ability, which is driven by a reversible change in the crystal structure, makes them capable candidates for morphing aircrafts, deployable medical implants, and solid-state actuators.  Beyond the unique mechanical response, atoms in some SMAs inexplicably move up 10 billion times faster near room temperature than predicted by current diffusion models.  As a result, the alloy spontaneously grows stronger but also less ductile over a period of weeks to years when left undisturbed at room temperature.  This project proposes a new theory for this unexplained behavior based on locally weakened bonding between atoms caused by instabilities of the crystal structure, which lowers the energy required for atomic motion along certain directions within the crystal.  The award supports a theory-driven experimental approach that augments the fundamental understanding of diffusion in crystalline solids.    Broader impacts of the project include research experience for undergraduate students, K-12 students, and especially those from underrepresented minorities and backgrounds, community outreach through contribution to science and technology exhibitions and makerspaces, and a ?living sculpture? artistic project using SMA technology in collaboration with the school of design and architecture.  Fundamental understanding gained from the project could lead to a new class of programmable materials whose properties change controllably with time over the course of months to years.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This project seeks to identify the origins of ultra-fast low-temperature diffusion observed in some shape memory alloys (SMAs), which cannot be explained with current diffusion models.  The knowledge gained will establish the basic understanding for a new mode of enhanced diffusion in crystalline solids based on phase instability and lattice softening.  This work proposes a hypothesis based on reduction of activation energy of vacancy-based diffusion due to orientation-dependent lattice softening of the unstable austenite.  The hypothesis will be tested experimentally in a single crystal model through inelastic x-ray scattering and electron microscopy.   It will also explain how rapid room-temperature nucleation and coarsening of precipitates can be possible in some alloys despite being far from their melting points.    At the basic science level, the project yields information on the phonon dispersion relations in beta-titanium shape memory alloys, and identifies soft phonon modes and their relationships with both phase transformation and abnormal diffusion at room temperature.  At an applied science and engineering level, the proposed work will clarify the origins of the room temperature aging effect in SMAs and identify strategies by which such instability can be eliminated. From an education and outreach perspective, the project will engage students at the intersection of science and the arts through a living sculpture project that utilizes the shape-changing characteristics of SMAs, and introduce advanced materials to designers and architects as a new set of tools in their toolbox.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the Hyflex model shows great promise, its implementation in the US and globally as an emergency response to COVID-19 has proven challenging. The mass transition from traditional in-person classroom environments to online learning in March 2020 required STEM educators to design flexible learning experiences and reconceptualize student engagement and participation. This project has the potential to transform and improve the accessibility of undergraduate STEM education in a Polytechnic Design Thinking core course required of 1500 students each year. The project proposes to expand upon a 2020-2021 pilot implementation of Hyflex by studying active learning strategies in blended synchronous instructional environments.  This project is designed to further define HyFlex as an educational model, optimize the approach, scale to 1500 students annually, and study the efficacy on student learning and sense of community. Lessons learned will be shared across campus (47,000 students, faculty, and staff) and nationally.<br/><br/>The research team will implement literature-based best practices in HyFlex learning, use design-based research to optimize the HyFlex learning experience, and study its impacts. To investigate student learning and sense of community, the project team will use pre-existing data from a large-scale freshman core course gathered during traditional face-to-face instruction as a comparison to the proposed HyFlex environment. The project PI is the course coordinator for an active learning core Design Thinking course with 1500 students annually, providing an ideal course for this study. To manage quarantines dictated by COVID-19 protocols, the project team piloted the HyFlex model during the 2020-2021 academic year, blending face-to-face and online learners synchronously. Using Self-Determination Theory as a lens, the analysis of quantitative and qualitative pilot data suggests the model meets dynamic and rapidly changing student needs. This project will build on the 2020-2021 foundation, which also supports a rigorous study design.

The research explores a novel approach to dramatically suppress the kinetics of some of these evolutions through minor addition of alloying elements. Since it is now known that addition of one solute can only imperfectly meet the many functions required for that goal, here a combination of synergistic elements is pursued. Atomistic simulations and modeling are used to identify the most effective combination of such alloying elements, and nanoscale experiments are designed to test and validate the proposed approach on model metallic alloys, including Cu-based alloys. This research impacts broadly the development of alloy design strategies for new materials that are critical to advanced energy technologies. The program supports the development of workforce in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math fields by supporting two graduate students and several undergraduate students. The research is integrated with undergraduate education by developing modeling modules and by implementing active learning techniques in the courses taught by the PIs.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This fundamental research investigates the use of solute additions for trapping point defects toward the design of radiation resistant alloys. The motivation stems from the recognition that the sustained fluxes of point defects to sinks such as grain boundaries and dislocations is the main factor contributing to the long-term degradation of materials during irradiation. In alloys, moreover, defect fluxes often couple to chemical fluxes, resulting in irradiation-induced segregation or even precipitation at sinks. An attractive solution is to increase point-defect recombination by adding point defect-trapping solutes. The challenge is to identify the best solutes that can trap point defect efficiently, without being progressively removed from the matrix by solute drag due to defect fluxes. The proposed research introduces the novel idea of using synergistic solutes to meet these multiple requirements, employing first principles calculations to determine solute-point defect interactions and self-consistent mean-field theory to calculate defect and solute transport coefficients. The experimental program aims at measuring directly the effect of solute on the overall vacancy diffusion and on solute drag. This is achieved by measuring the broadening and the drift of thin marker layers placed at strategic positions in a Cu thin film using atom probe tomography. The proposed experimental program is complemented by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The broader impact of the research includes the development of alloy design strategies for new materials that are critical to advanced energy technologies. The project will also establish an international collaboration with Dr. T. Schuler, from CEA, France, on the modeling of point defects and solute coupled transport.

The cumulative and concurrent impacts of multiple stressors remain relatively unknown and requires investigating their synergistic impacts across all life stages. Two common stressors in coastal environments are hypoxia, or low dissolved oxygen, and coastal acidification. Hypoxia and coastal acidification are linked to daily cycles of respiration and photosynthesis, even in pristine bays and estuaries. Coastal waters are also affected by pulses of natural and artificial freshwater runoff driven by rainfall and storm events. Pulses of freshwater can cause short-term, low salinity conditions, another stressor, that are expected to worsen with climate change. For many marine species, larval stages are the only means of migration and genetic exchange, and larvae are likely encountering hypoxia, coastal acidification, and low salinity stressors while they are in shallow coastal waters. Additionally, early juveniles may encounter extended periods of all three stressors. The interaction of early life-history stages with repeated and combinations of coastal stressors has the potential to result in an increase of larval/juvenile mortality or the removal of less tolerant larvae. The consequences of this differential mortality are being investigated in the eastern oyster using laboratory multi-stressor exposure experiments and in the field through genomic surveys of natural populations. Patterns of genetic selection are being analyzed by combining genomic and environmental data to elucidate how multiple stressors are shaping marine populations. Broader impacts include training opportunities for a post-doctoral fellow, graduate and undergraduate students and societal impacts. Results from the study are key to predicting how oyster reefs will adapt to long-term climate change and human population growth. A symposium is planned to bring scientists and members of the broader community together to discuss conservation and restoration of oyster reefs and sustainable aquaculture. A better understanding the physiological limits of larvae and juveniles to stressors is contributing to new strategies for oyster hatcheries to optimize selection and screening of brood stock for robust larvae and juveniles.<br/><br/>The broad goal is to characterize how hypoxia (DO), coastal acidification (CA), and low salinity events (LS) shape population connectivity and microevolutionary processes of marine invertebrates. As larvae grow and develop, they may be able to tolerate short-term exposures to environmental stressors, but prolonged exposure to diurnal DO/CA cycling and LS events may reduce subsequent survival, especially in juveniles. Larval and juvenile interactions with multiple stressors have the potential to either disrupt gene flow by simply not allowing migrant exchange or to act as a selective force, structuring populations through genotype-environment interactions. This project uses a coupled experimental and seascape genomics approach to investigate how multiple stressors are shaping observed genomic diversity. Phase 1 is determining how larval and juvenile genotypes and phenotypes respond to multiple stressors across different developmental time points. Experiments include two larval short-term exposures to factorial combinations of DO/CA and LS, and a long-term juvenile exposure to factorial combinations of DO/CA diurnal cycling and LS. The coding regions of genes expressed during experimental exposures are being sequenced using a cost-effective exome capture method. Phase 2 is determining the role of natural and anthropogenic forces shaping the evolution of oyster populations by testing if selective regimes differ and interact across life-history stages and if the frequencies of both neutral and resistant genotypes correlate with environmental conditions. Surveys of the genomes of adult populations across multiple localities from several urbanized estuaries are generating a seascape genomic framework based on a panel of genomic markers, including potential loci under selection during early-life history. These data are being integrated with environmental data to elucidate the mix of factors that contribute to population structure and local genetic diversity. Results are linking adult genotype frequencies at both neutral and putatively selective loci to changes in allele frequencies in response to early larval, late larval, and early juvenile exposure to stressors. The research is unraveling the complex interaction of selection, migration, and drift on marine genetic diversity for a mechanistic understanding of the genomic consequences of coastal stressor and their interaction on larvae.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Biological Oceanography and Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, learning programming is a difficult undertaking that can induce a wide array of emotions that may impact students' learning and belief in their abilities to learn programming.  This, in turn, may affect their persistence and eventual retention in both individual programming courses and computing-related degrees and careers.  This project looks to better understand how individual students' backgrounds and beliefs about their abilities shape their emotional responses to programming challenges, and how those responses in turn affect their beliefs.  The work will lead to better models of how people learn programming and inform the way programming is taught to undergraduate students, and may be especially beneficial to students from groups who often experience more negative emotions and lower self-efficacy than students overall, including women and minority students.  In the longer term, the project will contribute towards workforce development and broadening participation in computing and STEM in general.<br/><br/>This project aims to use novel ideas to advance the understanding of non-cognitive factors (emotions and self-efficacy) as they relate to learning introductory programming for undergraduate students.  The overarching research question is: how do students' emotions and self-efficacy beliefs interact with each other during programming tasks?  The work will also tease out how that interplay varies for students across differences in gender, ethnicity, and prior experience with programming, drawing on the diverse sample provided by doing the work at one of the largest public universities in the United States.  To do this, the project team will conduct two rounds of data collection and analysis.  During the first round, the validity and reliability of two data collection instruments (the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire for programming and Computer Programming Self-Efficacy Scale) will be established. In the second round the team will collect data using the validated scales, along with real-time biometric data and interviews.  Triangulating these data will help build both theoretical and computational models of the interplay between emotions and self-efficacy in the context of learning programming at the undergraduate level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prioritizing learners? agency in deciding what is worth knowing and how learning takes place may create more equitable and inclusive learning experiences by centering the knowledge, cultural practices, and social interactions that motivate learning for people across ages, genders, and backgrounds. In informal learning environments, families? social interactions are critical avenues for STEM learning, and science centers and museums have developed strategies for prompting families? sustained engagement and conversation at STEM exhibits. However, exhibits often guide visitors? exploration toward predetermined insights, constraining the ways that families can interact with STEM content, and neglecting opportunities to tap into their prior knowledge. Practices in the maker movement that emphasize skill-building and creative expression, and participatory practices in museums that invite visitors to contribute to exhibits in consequential ways both have the potential to reframe STEM learning as an ongoing, social process that welcomes diverse perspectives. Yet little is known about how these practices can be scaled, and how families themselves respond to these efforts, particularly for the diverse family audiences that science centers and museums aim to serve. Further, although gender and ethnicity both affect learning in informal settings, studies often separate participants along a single dimension, obscuring important nuances in families? experiences. By addressing these outstanding questions, this research responds to the goals of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning opportunities for the public in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening engagement in STEM learning experiences and advancing innovative research on STEM learning in informal environments.<br/> <br/>Research will address (1) how families perceive and act on their collective epistemic agency while exploring STEM exhibits (i.e., how they work together to negotiate and pursue their own learning goals); (2) whether and how families? expressions of agency are influenced by gender and ethnicity; and (3) what exhibit design features support expressions of agency for the broadest possible audience. Research studies will use interviews and observational case studies at a range of exhibits with distinct affordances to examine families? epistemic agency as a shared, social practice. Cultural historical activity theory and intersectional approaches will guide qualitative analyses of families? activities as systems that are mediated by the physical environment and social setting. Education activities will involve an ongoing collaboration between researchers, exhibit designers, educators, and facilitators (high-school and college-level floor staff), using a Change Laboratory model. The group will use emerging findings from the research to create a reflection tool to guide the development of more inclusive learning experiences at STEM exhibits, and a set of design principles for supporting families? expressions of agency. A longitudinal ethnographic study will document the development of inclusive exhibit design practices throughout the project as well as how the Change Lab participants develop their sociocultural perspectives on learning and exhibit design over time. Analyzing these shifts in practice within the Change Lab will provide a deeper understanding of what works and what is difficult or does not occur when working toward infrastructure change in museums. By considering how multiple aspects of families? identities shape their learning experiences, this work will generate evidence-based recommendations to help science centers and museums develop more inclusive practices that foster a sense of ownership over the learning process for the broadest possible audience of families.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many biomaterial approaches have been developed for pacing heart tissue without leads; the wires that connect to the tissue. Existing alternative strategies have not been successful in clinical settings. In this collaborative project between NSF and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF), Drs. Tian and Dvir propose to develop a new class of silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC)-based nanostructured membranes for optically controlled stimulation of cardiac tissues. The semiconductor-based membranes are flexible and biocompatible, and are capable of bypassing many of the current limitations faced by traditional cardiac pacing tools. The team will use the pulsed light illumination of the Si and SiC membranes to trigger the excitation of heart cells under physiological conditions. This research will provide new data that are critical for understanding and developing biomaterials-based tools to meet the needs of future cardiac therapy. The educational goals include providing learning opportunities for students in a highly interdisciplinary area.

Therefore, new biomaterial tools and biointerfaces are still highly desired for understanding the treatment of arrhythmias and conduction disorders. Drs. Tian and Dvir propose to develop a new class of silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC)-based nanostructured membranes for optically controlled, non-genetic modulation of cardiac tissues. The semiconductor-based membranes are flexible and biocompatible, and are capable of bypassing many of the current limitations faced by traditional modulatory devices. When activated by pulsed light illumination, the Si and SiC nanostructures can trigger membrane depolarization of cardiomyocytes under physiological conditions, causing the interfaced cardiomyocytes to fire action potentials. This research will provide new data that are critical for the fundamental understanding and development of biomaterials-based tools to enable future leadless cardiac resynchronization therapy. The research activities will provide learning opportunities for students in a highly interdisciplinary area. The proposed study will also provide a unique knowledge and skill set that can open new endeavors in the semiconductor or detector industry. Dr. Tian will build on existing model programs at the University of Chicago to increase diversity in science and engineering by offering summer research opportunities to high-school and undergraduate students.

Boron is next to carbon on the periodic table, but having one-fewer electrons than carbon leads to boron being characterized as an electron-deficient element. The electron deficiency of boron results in distinctive chemical and physical properties for boron-containing molecules and materials, and boron and metal boride nanoclusters display a rich range of structural and chemical bonding characteristics. There are significant experimental challenges to study these clusters, which exist only briefly before reacting to form more stable species, and, thus, must be carefully prepared. Professor Wang and his students are overcoming these challenges by developing innovative experimental techniques to investigate the structures and bonding of boron and metal-boride nanoclusters. The research not only provides fundamental knowledge about the boron-boron and metal-boron chemical bonding, but also has the potential to discover new boron and metal-boride nanomaterials valuable for industrial applications. The students engaged in this research are gaining critical thinking skills and valuable experience in advanced physical chemistry techniques. <br/><br/>The project focuses on 1) structural evolution of large boron clusters to lay the foundation for new boron nanostructures and 2) metal-boride clusters to probe the nature of the metal-boron chemical bonds. These clusters are produced using a laser-vaporization cluster source and investigated using two different types of home-built photoelectron spectroscopic apparatuses. One apparatus involves a magnetic-bottle photoelectron analyzer and is aimed to provide spectra with a wide range of photon energies. Well-resolved photoelectron spectra provide electronic fingerprints, which are crucial to be used to compare with theoretical calculations to elucidate the structures and bonding of size-selected clusters. A cryogenically-cooled ion trap is being developed to create cold boron clusters, which are essential to obtain well-resolved photoelectron spectra for large clusters. The second apparatus involves high-resolution photoelectron imaging, which is aimed to obtain vibrational information. The broader impact of this work includes the discovery of novel boron-based nanomaterials, which have potential technological applications and societal benefits. This project is integrated with the teaching of physical chemistry by Professor Wang, as well as providing training opportunities for students and postdoctoral associates in the design and construction of advanced experimental instrumentation and computational chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current practices that test a product?s effects on humans consist of lengthy, expensive, and harmful animal studies. Given the cost, many animal toxicity screenings often happen in later product development stages ? at which point millions of development dollars have already been spent. Major financial losses follow unfavorable screening results. Specifically, this technology will be developed with the intention to not only save millions of dollars downstream, but also maintain animal welfare and ethics in the product development process across industries. Compared to the current market offerings by others, this novel cell toxicity assay is intuitive and easy to manage with respect to time and the number of samples, while providing a rapid, accurate assessment.  The global toxicology testing market is projected to reach $14.4 billion by 2025. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at developing a novel, scalable in vitro toxicity assay that leverages a cellular-electrode interface bioprinting technology. Toxicological testing occurs toward the end of product development of a drug or consumer product after millions of dollars have already been poured into R&D.  These in vivo screens are expensive, harmful to animals, and have the potential to kill products after years of pre-market development. Bioprinting has emerged as a promising new approach for biofabricating models and systems for in vitro toxicology screening in an attempt to address the ethical and financial burden aforementioned. Yet, despite revolutionary potential, traditional bioprinting has technical and commercial drawbacks (e.g. cell damage, low throughput, high cost, inflexible). This proposal is designed to address those drawbacks by developing 1) a novel method to biofabricate tissues using an innovative bioprinting technique and 2) an integration of electrode sensors to quantitatively measure cell health and viability via electrical signal output correlations. Experimental success of tissue fabrication and electrode-cellular measurements will be determined by greater than 80% of cellular viability following novel bioprinting method and a correlation value of r> 0.6 between electrical impedance readings and canonical molecular toxicity analyses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Americans belong to many different social groups, many of which strive toward achieving common goals. Individuals can hold many different social identities and identify with multiple social groups at the same time. These group identities serve an important role in social life. They help to satisfy a sense of belonging and help people to organize and motivate action around common goals. For example, people from many different groups share a strong interest in reducing discrimination and societal inequality. Despite their shared goals, people from different groups may differ in how they think about and pursue solutions. Little is known about how belonging to multiple groups influences how people respond to social challenges such as inequality and how they might want to act to reduce it. This project examines how people from diverse backgrounds seek to pursue a common goal, identifies potential roadblocks to building effective diverse coalitions, and tests for a method to intervene to facilitate smooth group functioning. The specific context of the research is social inequality. Understanding how social identities may affect how people react when perceiving inequality is vital for understanding group functioning when individuals from diverse backgrounds try to work together to tackle such pressing societal issues. The project aims to offer insight into how coalitions may function and find ways to facilitate effective coalition-building among groups with diverse members.<br/><br/>This project seeks to collect data on and identify discrepancies in the preferred action of different coalition partners as well as the motivations underlying the discrepancies. The primary aims of the research are to 1) identify what types of action are supported by members of different social groups in the context of inequality, 2) identify the motivational processes that  underlie discrepancies in preferred action among ostensibly-allied individuals, 3) consider how individuals? multiple identities influence these motives and, subsequently, preferred action to reduce inequality, and 4) test whether assuaging identity-based motives and considering multiple identities reduces misalignment and enhance cohesion among a diverse coalition. Several experiments, including a final translational experimental study, examine these research questions in the context of several forms of social inequality. The broader objectives are to better understand potential conflicts within a diverse group of individuals who share the same goal and to identify methods to reduce conflict and support group cohesion.

Such cooperation is not naturally incentivized because the actions beneficial to upstream users can often negatively impact downstream users. These asymmetrical benefits create the potential for non-cooperative behavior in three key areas: 1) water withdrawal rights, 2) water quality responsibilities, and 3) risks associated with flooding. Historically, cooperative agreements among independent entities have required static legal agreements that created barriers to adaptation or policy improvement. This research will explore novel management approaches, such as market-based mechanisms, to overcome these challenges to cooperation. The anticipated efficiency and equity gains in these systems will advance prosperity and welfare for municipal, industrial, and agricultural water users; treatment plant and network operators; and the natural environment. Two contrasting use cases will be considered in this research: urban river restoration in the Anacostia Watershed (Use Case #1) in the metropolitan Washington, DC, area and economic development and ecological preservation in the Duck River Watershed (Use Case #2) in Tennessee. The work will establish new interdisciplinary collaborations between experts in operations research and water resources management, which will promote the progress of science and intellectual merit.<br/><br/>The work will use rigorous mathematical techniques to model deterministic and stochastic water infrastructure systems from a one-level and two-level equilibrium problem perspective based on non-cooperative game theory.

The novelty of this work is that it accounts for risk and benefits in a systematic, unified, and endogenous manner across all entities and their interactions and allows the system operator/regulator to effectively balance risk and cost under uncertain and/or changing conditions. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the work will lead to algorithmic advances in decomposition methods for water equilibrium problems as well as stochastic equilibrium models for this general class of infrastructure equilibrium problems. Also, a rolling-horizon, stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints will develop strategic learning algorithms for water stakeholders to improve their decision-making over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The process of merging and removing duplicate information from noisy data is known as entity resolution or record linkage. Entity resolution tasks are prevalent in many areas, including public health, human rights, official statistics, social networks, fraud detection, and national security, among others. Although probabilistic approaches for entity resolution have become more pervasive in recent years, principled approaches that are also computationally tractable and scalable for large data sets are limited. This project aims to develop Bayesian models and efficient computational algorithms suited for entity resolution tasks with heterogeneous types of data. The methods will be made accessible to practitioners and other researchers through open-source software. <br/> <br/>Entity resolution with multiple files can be treated as a clustering task in which similar records that represent the same latent entity are grouped together. In this context, a large number of small clusters or microclusters is expected. The following three general avenues of research will be explored: (a) adaptive prior distributions for random partitions that display microclustering properties and permit straightforward incorporation of prior information at different scales; (b) integrated Bayesian models suited for entity resolution tasks with social network data that are easily adaptable according to the nature of the available information; and (c) computational algorithms for model acceleration of entity resolution applications on big data. A variety of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms and efficient alternatives for posterior inference in the microclustering setting of entity resolution will be explored to overcome the known practical limitations of Bayesian inference in high-dimensional discrete spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When two monolayers of atomically thin materials, also knowns as two-dimensional (2D) materials, are stacked together with a well-controlled twist angle between these two layers, they form a new periodic structure with interesting properties. In this collaborative project, the PIs investigate these 2D materials to gain knowledge that could enable transformative technology innovations such as high-temperature superconductivity, quantum electronics and optoelectronics. This project integrates an education component to train students and build a strong workforce for quantum science and technologies. Under-represented groups are particularly encouraged and included in the education programs.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>Correlated states such as Mott insulators and Wigner crystals remain intriguing subjects of physics. More recently, twisted hetero-bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a new platform with even more enhanced correlation strength, and their strong spin-orbit coupling and presence of bandgaps provide new avenues to explore spin-related physics and optoelectronics in correlated states. In this collaborative proposal, the PIs explore the moiré superlattices formed by twisted hetero-bilayer TMDs. The research plan includes two main thrusts. Thrust I is to characterize the interaction strength of the correlated states and study its relationship with moiré structure parameters and external controls to manipulate the correlated states. Thrust II is to explore new correlated states arising from interactions with other electronic phases, such as the interplay of correlated states with Landau levels, the effect of strong correlation on valley physics and excitonic physics of the moiré superlattice, and other types of new states that could possibly arise in this strongly interacting system.

The award to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University has potential to increase the understanding of hydroformylation which is an industrial process to produce aldehydes. The project will create undergraduate and graduate courses in materials modeling, provide research training in computational materials science and catalysis and create internal and external collaborations with local community colleges and high schools.<br/> <br/>Hydroformylation is a process to produce aldehydes by the reaction of synthesis gas with alkenes. Currently, hydroformylation is carried out using Rh and or Co-based transition metal complexes as a catalyst. The homogeneous nature of this reaction leads to difficulties in catalyst separation and recovery, active metal losses, metal species contamination, and corrosivity of catalytic solutions. The development of heterogeneous catalytic systems without sacrificing the activity and selectivity will avoid the drawbacks associated with homogeneous catalysts and be highly useful. This project employs computational methods such as first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations to gain a fundamental understanding of catalytic science of ethylene hydroformylation to C3-oxygenates on heterogeneous Rh and Rh-based bimetallic model catalysts. The DFT calculations will provide the energetics of the reaction network and KMC simulations will be employed to obtain the kinetics of the reaction at experimental reaction conditions. The theoretical calculations will provide atomistic insight into ethylene hydroformylation and help identify simple catalytic descriptors that can be used to screen potential bimetallic catalysts that are active and selective for ethylene conversion to C3-oxygenates.

Understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of quantum processes such as charge and energy transfer is critical for rationally designing a wide variety of materials such as photovoltaic, photocatalytic, or energy-storage systems, optoelectronic and quantum materials. The computational modeling of the quantum processes in such complex systems at the atomistic level inevitably involves approximations that challenge the reliability of the computational predictions. The computational complexity also limits the range of the processes that can be studied from first principles. In this project, Akimov and his group will develop new theoretical frameworks, computational methodologies, and open-source software to lift the current limitations of quantum dynamics simulations in nanoscale systems. This project will explore the quality of the presently-used simplified approaches, re-evaluate them from more rigorous grounds, and bring the state of quantum dynamics calculations in large systems to a new level of rigor and practicality, unreachable before. The open-source software developed in this project will enable researchers to study new, previously inaccessible, classes of solar energy materials, contributing toward sustainable and renewable energy economy development. Dr. Akimov?s research program is closely integrated with his outreach and educational programs, including workshops on theoretical chemistry for graduate students and a virtual international seminar series for a broad scientific audience.<br/><br/>In this project, the Akimov group will develop and study reliable and efficient methods for modeling quantum nonadiabatic dynamics in condensed matter and nanoscale systems. The nonlinear dimensionality reduction and machine learning strategies will be explored to enable computing many nanosecond-long quantum trajectories, without expensive ab initio calculations. These strategies are expected to help obtain the converged statistics of electronic transitions and estimate the error bars in computed properties. They will also enable modeling intrinsically slow quantum processes and infrequent events and help accelerate nonadiabatic dynamics modeling of large systems. The project aims to identify the ?effective? low-dimensional coordinates that can be used to facilitate the analysis of photoexcited dynamics in various materials. New techniques for nonadiabatic dynamics in large systems will be developed based on the formally-exact hierarchy of equations of motion method. These developments enable the accurate description of the bath-induced decoherence, and thermalization of excited states in complex systems, in a non-perturbative way. New nonadiabatic dynamics methods for computing electronic state couplings and energies at the many-body level, beyond the commonly-used single-particle picture, will be developed and implemented in open-source codes. These advancements seek to enable computational material scientists to model excitonic dynamics in quantum-confined systems and capture slow dynamics with infrequent electronic transitions. The nonadiabatic dynamics approaches resulting from this project will be validated against the model and experimental references. These efforts aim to assess modern approximate quantum-classical methods for extended systems and bring them to a new level of rigor and reliability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, some of the outstanding open problems in topology concern manifolds specifically of dimension 4, and the study of such manifolds has important links with many areas of mathematics.

In nature, these extremely stable bonds are hydrolyzed by highly specialized enzymes. However, currently only a few natural enzymes have been successfully employed for the aforementioned applications but with some deficiencies. Therefore, the development of small molecules that can mimic the activities of natural enzymes is of interest. However, realization of this goal is very challenging and necessitates a rigorous integration of experiments and theoretical calculations.

To some extent, this is true, but the field is badly fragmented: different disciplines operate mostly in isolation; many professional schools focus on only their own kind of organization (e.g., hospitals, schools, public agencies, businesses). Meanwhile, social-science departments often regard the science of organizations as outside their purview, yet doctoral training in professional schools sometimes lacks the depth available in social-science departments. To better respond to this situation, this project convenes a series of workshops and multi-disciplinary collaborations to advance the science of organizations and imagine its future directions. <br/>These workshops will engage the network and expertise already shaped by the four Summer Institutes on ?Organizations and Their Effectiveness? at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) at Stanford University, co-directed by Robert Gibbons (MIT) and Woody Powell (Stanford University).

The teams will discuss the ecosystem of research funding for organizational science, including government agencies such as the NSF, major foundations and philanthropies, and university centers. After identifying areas of consensus and disagreement, participants will collaborate on strategies that warrant further elaboration and synthesize these recommendations. In this way, these workshops seek two related objectives: to enlist young experts in imagining the future of the science of organizations; and to cultivate potential leaders and collaborators in implementing this future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Murray and John von Neumann as a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. With recent breakthroughs in quantum computing, the study of von Neumann algebras is poised to yield insights into deep problems in the theory of quantum computation which must be overcome to make quantum computing and quantum cryptography practical, efficient technologies. One goal of this project is to use tools from von Neumann algebras to provide insights into so-called ?quantum expanders? which have applications to quantum error correction and quantum cryptography. This is part of the broader goal of the project to investigate quantitative aspects of von Neumann algebras. Other potential applications lie in the theory of random matrices, which are used in diverse applications in many fields from quantum physics to biology and big data. This project will contribute to workforce development by providing research training and mentoring opportunities at the undergraduate and graduate level. <br/> <br/>The project aims to make progress in several directions around quantifying and developing new invariants for exploring the phenomenon of rigidity in von Neumann algebras. One objective is to further develop the theory and use of cohomological rigidity techniques in Popa?s deformation/rigidity theory based on techniques developed by the PI jointly with collaborators on the existence and uniqueness of maximal rigid subalgebras of deformations. This could lead to progress towards settling two outstanding conjectures in the field, the Peterson-Thom conjecture and absence of Cartan subalgebras for von Neumann algebras of groups having nontrivial first cohomology with coefficients in the left-regular representation. Techniques from continuous model theory will also be explored as potential avenues to these conjectures by attempting to find noncommutative analogs to Anderson and Keisler?s model theoretic approach to stochastic differential equations. A second objective is to develop experimental and quantitative approaches to property Gamma, in part based on the PI?s discovery of malnormal matrices in his work with Mulcahy. The PI will approach these problems using a mix of techniques from ergodic theory, random matrix theory, computability theory, and von Neumann algebras. Results in this direction could lead to new insights at the interface of von Neumann algebras and quantum computing. A third objective is to explore the applications of uniform 2-norms to the classification theory of nuclear C*-algebras based on the PI?s work with Goldbring and Hart on the continuous model theory of correspondences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award to North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University has potential to increase the understanding of the cell membrane. The proposed study intends to train undergraduate and graduate students in the study of an enzyme that affects cell membrane function. The PI will actively engage and recruit underrepresented minority students into the project so that the students may engage in cutting edge research.

In this proposed work, the PI will identify the PKC?-mediated phosphorylation site in BCATc, express and purify the PKC?-phosphorylated BCATc, and solve the crystal structure of the phosphorylated BCATc to analyze the structural changes of BCATc triggered by the phosphorylation by PKC?. The work will analyze the structure of PKC?-BCATc complex via co-crystallization and other biophysical methods, e.g. SPRi to uncover the protein-protein interaction interface and further understand the mechanism of the phosphorylation process. The constructed model built from the project outcomes will enable the PI to understand the mechanism of how the redox-regulated phosphorylation of BCATc by PKC? regulates its conformational changes that further regulate its membrane localization.

However, data is often too large and complex to analyze in its entirety, and therefore different techniques are used to summarize the data in order to work with smaller, more manageable representations of it.  This project studies the data-comparison problem through the lens of mathematics, using geometric and topological signatures to represent these shapes concisely. This project will consider a variety of different kinds of shape data which live in some larger geometric or topological space (e.g., GIS trajectories, point sets, meshes, 3d scans, or graphs), and consider classes of algebraic, geometric, and graphical signatures which can be used to represent these shapes concisely.  The project draws primarily upon the nascent yet rapidly developing area of topological data analysis, where tools from topology like homology or homotopy are combined with geometric measures to create robust analysis tools for analyzing the shape of data. Graduate and undergraduate students will be tightly integrated into the project, and special efforts will be made to involve students from underrepresented groups. Additional efforts by the research team include planning a workshop focused on women in this field, as well as broadening diversity and inclusion efforts in their own universities.<br/><br/>The project focuses on shapes that have some common underlying annotation framework on top of the signature, which is usually additional structural or geometric information from the original embedding. The research consists of two major components.  In the first, the investigators are initiating a principled study of algorithms and approaches to develop a unified framework which leverages multiple signatures for shape comparison. The goal of this phase is to provide theoretical results as well as empirical evaluations on a variety of data sets and signatures. The second major component of the project studies inverse problems, which aim to reconstruct shapes from a combination of signatures.  Such problems are notoriously difficult for geometric or topological signatures, as they are necessarily lossy and remove certain types of information.  During the course of the project, the investigators are also developing a shape signatures toolkit that enables computation of a range of signatures and distances, adding to the software both existing notions of distance and new ones developed over the course of the project.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algorithmic Foundations Core Program and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microscopic flows generated by cilia are central to biology; examples include muco-ciliary clearance in the lung, ciliary transport of the fertilized ovum along the fallopian tube to the uterus, and the propulsion of bacteria and protozoa. Engineered mimics of these structures developed as microfluidic technologies offer unique solutions for transport at the microscale for mixers, pumps and as microfluidic rheological sensors in blood clotting diagnostics. In this project, photolithographically molded biomimetic ciliated surfaces will be used to investigate fundamental questions pumping and mixing. The lessons learned will be used to design and control ciliated swimmers, i.e. biomimetic paramecia.<br/><br/>This project has three goals focused on pumping, mixing, and swimming in low Reynolds number fluid. Starting with pumping, the project will study the ways in which arrays of actuators can generate flows. Using designed arrays and actuation strategies, the project will use arrays of similar actuator geometry and compare the utility of different strategies for breaking time symmetry of motion. Using the same arrays, the project will generate coordinated time-asymmetric beats between actuators (pairs, arrays, etc.), time asymmetric beats in single actuators, and metachronal waves where the time-asymmetry extends over tens of actuators. The nature of these flows will be studied to understand the length scale of long-range fluid motions and for mixing, which in part may occur on short length scales. Next, the project will use the arrays to focus on mixing. In the low Reynolds number of microfluidics systems, fluids cannot support turbulence and therefore mixing is diffusion limited. The project will identify the parameters of beating actuators that provide high mixing. Finally, the project will fabricate free swimmers that will be untethered. The design rules that govern the generation of directed flow for surface attached structures directly transfer to swimmer design. In this way, the project will completely close the loop between fluid pumping and swimmer propulsion. In total, the research program will design actuating surfaces for better biomedical diagnostics and design micro-robotics for future implantable treatment strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Certain fluid motions are repeatedly observed in turbulent boundary layers and contribute significantly to drag on surfaces. Mechanisms that sustain turbulent motions in the inner region of the boundary layer were previously identified and have inspired control strategies for drag reduction and simple models for prediction. This research will seek to identify mechanisms for coherent motions in the outer region, which could then be better modelled to more accurately predict vehicle drag and could lead to drag reduction strategies. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be trained and mentored in the laboratory through the research initiative and graduate students will be educated in a research-based class at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Additionally, math tutor and introductory engineering educational programs will be implemented at the Danville Correctional Facility, a medium security men?s state prison in Illinois.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to evaluate a hypothesized cycle that generates and sustains coherent motions in the outer region of turbulent boundary layers. The project has three tasks: two that focus on mechanisms through which different coherent motions can interact and one that focuses on the characterization of the coherent motions involved. The interaction of a small von Karman vortex street with a turbulent boundary layer will be studied using time-resolved particle image velocimetry, yielding insights into the interaction of large- and small-scale coherent motions. The amplification of small-scale coherent motions will be investigated by performing a resolvent analysis of the Navier-Stokes equation with a quasi-base flow, which includes both the mean and a single large-scale coherent motion. The small-scale coherent motions will be characterized using a new sampling approach for turbulent boundary layer data that leverages the current understanding of the interaction of coherent motions in turbulent boundary layers.

Earlier civilizations with sociopolitical hierarchies often had complex infrastructure designed to organize movement of people and resources. For example, impressive constructions like temple pyramids and causeways, connected local residents to important buildings while also legitimizing the authority of governing entities or individual rulers. Sociopolitical powers also influence the way natural resources are supplied to a population. The doctoral dissertation project examines social differentiation in households through the recovery and analysis of animal bones at a site in an early stage of social complexity development. Examining animal (faunal) remains, which primarily survive in archaeology as bones, help to determine if these products were unevenly allocated within residences during the period of initial urbanization in the region. This project contributes to ongoing discussions on the origins of states by outlining the cooperative nature of an archaic state. The research thus highlights dynamics of an ancient community by studying the way neighborhoods were organized demarcating unity and hierarchy. This project supports the training of a doctoral student from an underrepresented minority in the sciences. <br/><br/>Animal bones in archaeological deposits are often interpreted as preserved remnants of animals that people consumed in the past. This study  aids in answering the central question of whether status differentiation in the form of elite to nonelite members (commoners) at the site were clearly defined through diet. By analyzing patterns in species distribution, the project will: (1) identify amounts of local and non-local animals; (2) reveal the presence or absence of difficult to acquire vs. common organisms; and (3) determine the quantity of dissimilar proportions of fauna amongst households. The doctoral student will excavate several household structures and their refuse disposals. Faunal samples will be catalogued, weighed, and counted using common zooarchaeological quantification units. Quantitative data will be statistically analyzed and graphically modeled. Coupling this zooarchaeological investigation with examinations of household structural design and building material, residential location, and associated artifacts is essential to being able to recognize social identities among the prehistoric people. Such an approach also provides contextual support for social inequality in an ancient population while furthering the progressive understanding of a contemporary and relevant issue: socioeconomic control over the distribution of natural resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electron-neutral interactions drive many important chemical and physical processes, yet they are difficult to explore experimentally.  From a practical standpoint, controlling electrons is challenging because they are thousands of times lighter than atoms, which themselves are tiny particles, while at the same time, the electric charge carried by the electron makes it vulnerable to deflection by the earth?s magnetic field, among other weak influencing forces present in laboratory settings.  Professor Jarrold overcomes these hurdles by preparing the free electrons in a controlled way, which is to target negatively charged molecules with a laser pulse that removes an electron with a known amount of energy, and in the desired proximity of a neutral target molecule. The array of molecules selected for study are chosen to sample a broad range of properties that affect their interactions with electrons.  <br/><br/>The experiments involve the novel use of photoelectrons as a tool for probing valence-bound, non-valence-bound, and temporary anion states of molecules and bimolecular complexes, with an emphasis on preparing and probing systems that do not neatly fall into any of these three categories.  This project addresses several hypotheses involving the description of electron-driven chemistry, the increasingly complex landscape for electron-bimolecular interactions, and the rules that govern non-valence-bound anion lifetimes.  Probing these systems experimentally with energy-selected electrons is achieved by detachment of anionic precursors, which provides a route to mapping the energy-dependence of electron-neutral interactions, some of which initiate electron-driven chemistry.  Additional studies include fluorescence lifetime and dispersed fluorescence measurements on non-valence-bound excited states of anions.  Interpretation of data collected on these complex and often transient species is supported by calculations conducted by collaborator Professor Thomas Sommerfeld of Southeastern Louisiana University, who has expertise in the theoretical treatment of non-valence states of anions. The broader impacts include a more complete picture of electron-driven chemical and physical processes, which is a prerequisite for controlling these processes.  In addition, participants in this project receive well-rounded graduate or postdoctoral training in a range of techniques in chemical physics, coupled with ample professional development opportunities, in the laboratory of a PI with a deep commitment to diversity and equity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It involves a mix of pursuits, including the development of new tools and the solution of open problems. A main theme is understanding complicated systems in terms of simple building blocks. For example, a primary aim is to describe global phase spaces in terms of a concrete list of local combinatorial models. This offers a new language to capture intricate phenomena through an elementary syntax. The methods are inspired by singularity theory, where symmetry-breaking often reveals hidden structure. In addition to original research, a broad goal of the project is the education of students in the new frontiers of rapidly developing fields. There will also be ample opportunities for outreach across fields and for increased public engagement with mathematics. <br/> <br/>The research centers around symplectic manifolds, the modern descendants of classical phase spaces, and their quantum invariants. More specifically, the projects focus on symplectic manifolds arising in algebraic geometry (Kahler manifolds) and gauge theory (moduli of bundles and connections). Specific directions focus on Lagrangian singularities and skeleta of Weinstein manifolds, microlocal sheaves in mirror symmetry, and the Betti Geometric Langlands correspondence. The main goals include a combinatorial approach to Weinstein manifolds, foundations of microlocal sheaves in homological mirror symmetry, and a Verlinde formula for automorphic categories. The methods span a range of techniques in symplectic geometry, algebraic topology, and gauge theory. They connect with central pursuits in supersymmetric gauge theory, in particular higher structures coming from four-dimensional topological field theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of these changes can be beneficial, helping an organism to persist in unfavorable conditions. But other changes may be costly or damaging and may eventually lead to death if conditions are harsh enough. In common types of experiments that measure physiological plasticity, it is often impossible to identify which changes are beneficial, and which are not. This impedes understanding the physiological mechanism that may facilitate or limit responses to changing environments. This research explores how exposure to low temperatures affects transcription, a critical step in the process of synthesizing new proteins.  By comparing low temperature responses of temperate fly species that often encounter very cold temperatures (well below freezing) to tropical fly species that rarely encounter cold temperatures, the investigators will identify which processes are beneficial for persistence in cold environments. The research will also attempt to quantify the lower temperature limits of transcription and will test whether these limits can evolve when flies experience new environments. This research will be integrated with biology education at the undergraduate level. The investigators will develop a Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) allowing students to participate in authentic research as part of an introductory biology course. Underrepresented student groups often have reduced access to research opportunities; the CURE will be purposefully designed to encourage broad participation and to provide a gateway to further research experiences for underrepresented student groups.  <br/><br/>Environmentally-induced changes in the transcriptome provide a widely used and relatively comprehensive snapshot of how cellular, tissue, or whole organismal physiology changes across environments. However, in commonly used experimental designs it is impossible to infer whether a change in abundance of any particular transcript has beneficial or detrimental effects on performance, and ultimately fitness. Common approaches to quantify differential expression in transcripts are further limited because they cannot distinguish the effects of new transcription and transcript degradation on transcript abundance. Thus, the transcriptional dynamics regulating transcriptomic environmental responses also remain largely unknown. This research will compare profiles of newly formed transcripts during low temperature exposures among replicate temperate- and tropical-origin Drosophila species. Combining sequencing of chromatin-associated RNA fractions and bromouridine-labeled new transcripts with standard messenger RNA sequencing, the research team will 1) identify putatively beneficial changes in new transcription or transcript degradation rates associated with adaptation to low temperature, and 2) characterize reaction norms for transcriptional dynamics in a comparative framework. The research will be integrated with undergraduate education by developing lab exercises that allow undergraduates to test the roles of individual genes in thermal adaptation using transgenically-modified lines of Drosophila melanogaster. This CURE will integrate with ongoing efforts at CU Denver to improve outcomes for underrepresented groups and increase their representation in STEM fields. The CURE will also generate a database of transparently reported results that will contribute to candidate gene testing in the field of thermal biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the aims of moduli theory is to try to understand properties of a given variety by thinking about the space of all possible shapes such a variety can have. This space of all shapes is the moduli space of a variety of a given numerical type. For example, the cubic threefold is a variety in 4-space given by one equation of degree 3. Much modern progress in understanding moduli is due to degeneration techniques ? the idea of understanding a given variety by thinking how it can break up into simpler objects. This project aims to further the understanding of the properties of some of the moduli spaces central to algebraic geometry: the moduli of cubic threefolds, the moduli of complex curves (that is, objects that from close up look like complex numbers), and other related moduli spaces. In particular, the PI will study how such varieties can degenerate, or break up, and will aim to understand the behavior of geometric constructions under such degenerations. The project will support the work of the PI and his PhD students on these topics. <br/>    <br/>The project aims to better understand the geometry of compactifications of some of the moduli spaces ubiquitous in algebraic geometry: moduli of of curves, of curves with a differential, and of cubic threefolds.

The PI will apply the compactification of the strata of differentials (that is, of moduli of curves with a differential with prescribed multiplicities of zeroes and poles) that he constructed with other researchers.  The PI will also investigate the birational geometry of strata and will approach the central orbit classification questions in Teichmueller dynamics by applying degeneration techniques of algebraic geometry. The PI will apply real-normalized differentials, the geometry of which he studied, and the degeneration techniques he co-developed to work towards a sharp upper bound for the number of cusps of plane curves.

Although speech itself is uniquely human, vocal learning, the ability to modify vocal output as a result of experience, has evolved independently in multiple mammals and birds, including songbirds, parrots, hummingbirds, bats, and whales, as well as humans, uniquely among great apes. During the evolution of each of these species, genome sequence mutations over millions of years have led to differences in the molecular properties of cell types within their brains, allowing for their vocalizations to be learned. This project leverages that diversity across species to take a comparative genomic approach to understanding how vocal learning evolved: what features do the genomes of vocal learning species have in common relative to species without this ability? To answer that question, this research will develop artificial intelligence methods to look for common patterns of gene activity across dozens of brain cell types and common genome sequence patterns across hundreds of mammals. In addition to linking vocal learning behavior to specific cell types and genome sequence mutations, the artificial intelligence methods that will be developed have the potential to be applied to study the evolution of additional behaviors and other traits that vary across species with available genomes. To help facilitate the adoption of these methods, as well as other new artificial intelligence approaches, this project seeks to train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists, who are experts in artificial intelligence, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience. Undergraduate neuroscience and biology majors will get the opportunity to participate in the research by applying the computational techniques to other behaviors. More broadly, a video and guided tutorials that explain the research and how to conduct it will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>Vocal learning demonstrates striking similarities across several of the lineages at multiple levels including the behavior itself, neural circuit features, and even shared gene expression patterns. Despite this wealth of information, there is still no solid connection between genotype and phenotype. This project seeks to make that connection by linking vocal learning-associated gene expression patterns to specific neural cell types that form the neural circuits for the production of vocalization and by linking them to variation in genome sequence at candidate regulatory elements. To uncover the cell type-specific gene expression features associated with vocal learning behavior, a nested tree probabilistic graphical model-- a machine learning approach that simultaneously models hierarchies of cell types and species -- will be applied. Then, to trace the evolution of regulatory elements associated with those gene expression patterns, convolutional neural network models that predict differences in open chromatin from differences in genome sequence will be applied. As a result of these analyses, this project will produce hypotheses for how differences in genome sequence between vocal learners and non-learners lead to differences in cell type-specific gene expression and open chromatin. Beyond the contributions to the study of vocal learning, the tools developed here fill a growing need for methods to study the evolution of cell types and regulatory elements across a rapidly increasing set of genomes.

To achieve the requisite accuracy, GPS, for example, relies on general relativity, which in turn postulates that gravity is the result of a curved space-time on which waves travel rather than an external force. And in many applications involving nonlinear equations, the governing systems have geometry that depends on the solution but the solution in turn depends on the geometry. Einstein?s equations, which are at the heart of general relativity and determine the evolution of a universe from a given starting state, can be realized as such a system of wave equations in certain coordinate systems. On background geometries, waves flow along special curves called geodesics rather than rays as is more familiar. A phenomenon called trapping occurs when some of these geodesics remain in a bounded set for all time. This occurs, for example, on known black hole space-times where there are indeed regions where light orbits the black hole rather than tending toward infinity. Trapping is a known obstruction to typical measures of dispersion, and a major focus of this project is to precisely quantify its effect in numerous scenarios. The project provides research training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The problems to be examined largely focus on integrated local energy estimates, which are generalizations of the original estimates of Morawetz, and their application to nonlinear equations. Major initiatives include improving our understanding of such estimates in the presence of trapping and on non-stationary backgrounds. The construction of space-times with degenerate trapping provided the first examples where an algebraic loss of regularity is both necessary and sufficient for recovering local energy estimates. Numerous questions related to these examples remain unexplored, including the discovery of space-times with degenerate trapping outside of the highly symmetric warped product setting. Local energy estimates can be used to establish long-time existence for nonlinear equations and have particular benefits in the presence of background geometry. Planned work related to this include the examination of wave equations on half-spaces and applications of a related weighted estimate of Dafermos and Rodnianski to critically damped equations related to the Strauss conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this research is to develop representations for years-long video streams that facilitate analysis and understanding of phenomena at a wide range of time scales. To serve this purpose, the representations need to be compact, allow for full reconstruction of the input, and organize scene content by timescale. To achieve this, a dataset of video streams will be collected and scene-specific models will be trained to encode video frames into compact latent vectors. A novel regularization scheme will impose order in the latent space, arranging the representation of the scene's content by how quickly it varies. The research will enable new ways to detect, monitor, and understand phenomena that occur over weeks, months, and years. Existing video understanding applications such as anomaly detection, action recognition, and video prediction will also benefit by operating in a compact and organized self-supervised latent space. Finally, the research will further progress towards understanding how to encode temporal redundancy in videos and yield insights about general video understanding by helping to determine what is possible with the absence of camera motion and an abundance of observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meteoroids are defined as solid particles of natural origin in space, which typically originate from the breakup of comets and asteroids and are categorized according to their origin. On average, over 100 billion meteoroids enter Earth?s atmosphere daily with masses larger than 1 microgram.  Meteoroids travel between 11 and 72.8 km/s relative to the Earth if in solar orbit; a small, though as yet undetermined, fraction originates outside of our solar system, implying that distant stellar systems can impact Earth?s environment.  The light and associated physical phenomena associated with a meteoroid?s passage through a planet?s atmosphere is called a meteor, which results from the plasma created by the meteoroid as it ionizes the gas along its trajectory.  <br/><br/>Although meteoroids have a profound effect on our space environment, we know very little about their fundamental properties.  The connection between meteoroid properties and plasma formation still remains poorly understood due to a lack of knowledge regarding how background properties influence the plasma dynamics and also how selection effects in the observing instrument impacts detection.  This project seeks to answer these questions by probing into the plasma physics that surrounds the meteoroid, known as the head echo plasma, and uncover the connection between meteoroid properties, plasma formation, and the properties of the background ionosphere. The research will address many of the outstanding questions in the meteor and meteoroid community, including the mass deposition rate into our atmosphere, the dominant density population, and the effect of the background electric and magnetic fields on plasma expansion and distribution.  This fundamental research includes the development of three simulations, including a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) model and a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) algorithm to determine the plasma formation and expansion, and a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) model to correlate radar signal strength with plasma density.  The project team will also collect and analyze High-Power, Large-Aperture (HPLA) radar data at diverse geographic locations.  <br/><br/>This research will contribute to the National Space Weather Program?s goal of understanding the evolution of ionospheric irregularities, and answer the following three scientific questions:<br/>1) What are the properties of meteor plasmas, including peak plasma density and distribution?<br/>2) How is meteoroid ablation and plasma formation affected by the physics of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere?<br/>3) What are the properties of the parent meteoroids, including mass, bulk density, and velocity, and how do they correlate to the meteor plasmas?<br/><br/>The results of this research will enable understanding of impact plasma and facilitate collaboration between MIT Haystack Observatory and Stanford University.

The research will be integrated into the classroom at Stanford University, including three graduate classes and one undergraduate class designed and taught by the PI. In addition to developing and teaching these courses, the PI frequently engages in outreach activities, such as with grade schools, the Mission to Mars Program for undergraduate students, and various television programs, such as National Geographic, the Weather Channel, and PBS NOVA, where she has described how meteoroids can threaten interplanetary space programs.

The Downbursts are rapidly descending columns of air that can cause strong, damaging winds that pose a threat to aviation, infrastructure, livestock, and human life. Meteorologists rely on weather radar data to detect developing downbursts, but because they are relatively localized and can develop quickly, it is often difficult to issue warnings for them in advance. However, recent advancements in radar technology now permit improved insight into the factors that lead to downbursts, but a comprehensive study examining such signatures has yet to be performed. By better understanding the causes of downbursts and what these factors look like in their existing radar data, forecasters will be able to better anticipate their occurrence and intensity before they reach the ground, and thus provide earlier warnings with fewer false alarms and more time for people to safely seek shelter. In addition, as computers play an increasingly large role in deciding when to issue severe weather warnings, the insights gained from this study will help determine how reliably weather models simulate downbursts and provide the basis for future automated downburst detection. The project involves mentoring a graduate student to be the next generation of atmospheric scientists. <br/><br/>This study seeks to use both observations and numerical simulations of downbursts in a complementary manner to understand the relation between the sources of negative buoyancy that drive downbursts and their manifestation in observed dual-polarization radar variables.

Additionally, a one-dimensional model with spectral bin microphysics that is coupled to a forward polarimetric radar operator will then be used to simulate downbursts and quantitatively examine the association between the environment, sources of negative buoyancy (i.e., precipitation loading and diabatic cooling), and the resultant downburst intensity with the evolution and spatial distribution of the simulated polarimetric variables.

A combination of drought and heat stress occurring during the summers of 1980, 1988, 2000, 2003 and 2008, for example, resulted in yield losses estimated in 33, 44, 7.6, 7 and 8.6 billion dollars, respectively. Because episodes of drought and heat stress are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the coming years, due to the largely unopposed process of global warming and its consequential impacts on climate change, breeding crops for enhanced tolerance to a combination of drought and heat stress is of the utmost importance for modern agriculture and food sustainability. Crucial for yield loss during episodes of drought and heat stress are processes such as flowering and fertilization that are especially sensitive to these conditions, as well as highly important for yield production in almost all cereals and legumes. In this project the focus is on the impact of heat, drought, and drought and heat combination on flowering, fertilization, and seed production of soybean. Using a combination of experimental tools, genes and proteins that are essential for enhancing the tolerance of soybean to these stressful conditions will be identified. These proteins and genes will enable breeders to develop new genotypes that will resist the harsh conditions of our current and future environment and ensure a secure and sustainable soybean seed production for years to come.<br/><br/>A combination of drought and heat stress occurring during the reproductive growth phase of many different crops, such as soybean, corn, rice, and wheat, has a devastating impact on yield. In soybean, a considerable effort has been made to develop genotypes with enhanced yield production under conditions of drought or heat stress. However, how these genotypes perform under conditions of drought and heat stress combination is mostly unknown. Moreover, although past research has focused on the impact of abiotic stress on pollen viability, recent findings reveal that the combination of drought and heat stress has a unique impact on reproductive processes that occur post pollen germination. Here, it is proposed to utilize a unique collection of soybean genotypes with altered seed production under conditions of drought or heat stress conditions to identify genes and gene networks impacting seed production under a combination of drought and heat stress. Using a combination of field and growth chamber studies focused on the effect of drought and heat stress combination on reproductive tissues and yield of different soybean genotypes, coupled with microdissection techniques, RNA sequencing and machine learning-driven network analysis tools, genes and gene networks that impact reproductive processes under conditions of stress combination will be identified.

The concept of diffusion has recently received renewed attention with the discovery of giant concentration fluctuations (of spatial extent approaching 10,000 times molecular length scales) that develop during diffusive mixing of three-dimensional (3D) fluids in the presence of a concentration gradient. The concentration fluctuations are expected to be even larger in two-dimensional (2D) fluids due to the larger spatial extent of hydrodynamic interactions between diffusing particles. Bio-membranes can be modeled as quasi-2D fluids, having a combination of 2D and 3D hydrodynamic features due to the presence of a bulk fluid embedding the membrane. This project studies experimentally and theoretically the spatial and temporal extent of out-of-equilibrium concentration fluctuations, the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior, and the effects of fluctuations on the aggregation rate of diffusing particles in freely suspended smectic films, a model quasi-2D fluid.  The research team is using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) of dye dissolved in the film, and a miscibility phase transition in films of a binary liquid crystal mixture as well as in a dye-doped lipid Langmuir monolayer, to measure the concentration correlation function through the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior. The theory component of the project involves performing analytic calculations and running computer simulations, based on the immersed boundary method and stochastic hydrodynamics and using initial concentration distributions characteristic of the experiments, in order to generate a comparison to the observed concentration correlation functions.

Because they are charged, these polymers dissolve in water, substantially increasing viscosity. When polyelectrolytes of opposite charge are mixed, they associate to give new materials, polyelectrolyte complexes or PECs, with potential applications as membranes for purification, biomedical materials, antifouling coatings, and waterproof adhesives. Salt helps to loosen the attractions between oppositely charged polymers, allowing the material to be processed into desired shapes. All of these valuable applications depend on how the properties of these PECs can be designed by choice of materials and processing conditions. This research will shed light on three parameters essential to understanding the response and performance of PECs. First, the size of polymer coils, known to be entangled within the amorphous PEC, will be measured inside the material by labeling polymer chains with heavy atoms. Second, the efficiency of salt in actively breaking interactions between polymer charges, as opposed to passively sitting near the charges, will be investigated. Finally, the influence of salt on water, salt and polymer content of PECs will be measured with ultraprecise analytical techniques. In addition to serving as a training vehicle for domestic students, this project will reach out across continents, engaging colleagues and students in France and in Nigeria in seminars on polyelectrolytes and other aspects of modern polymer science and technology.  <br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Polyelectrolyte coacervation/complexation, PECs, a subset of liquid/liquid phase separation, occurs when two polyelectrolytes of opposite charge are mixed. The system represents a hydrated blend of charged polymers with characteristics overlapping both a hydrogel and a classical blend of neutral polymers. This morphology offers novel applications in the areas of separations/purification, biomedical materials, antifouling coatings, energy conversion, and waterproof adhesives. The materials and their properties also lie at the intersection of intense interest in liquid/liquid phase separation from the physics, chemistry, biology and materials fields. A deep understanding of the properties of PECs requires knowledge of many parameters both fundamental to polymer science and unique to PECs. The proposed research will accurately measure three important parameters. First, the scaling of the polymer coil size as a function of molecular weight will be determined using a series of narrow molecular-weight-distribution deuterated polyelectrolytes. The second area addresses the central uncertainty of what happens to salt ions when they enter a PEC to break pairing between positive and negative repeat units: whether each ion breaks a pair or whether some of the ions are simply present to balance the osmotic pressure between PEC and solution. In the final subproject, a series of short-chain-length polyelectrolytes, radiolabeled with C-14, will be prepared and employed in highly precise and accurate radioanalytical methods to determine a PEC phase diagram as a function of molecular weight. All of these parameters are needed to supply the burgeoning theoretical treatments with reliable data.

By doing so, it will advance the science base of critically important materials and manufacturing processes, and provide technological benefits for industry sectors as diverse as energy systems, ground transportation and aerospace. The project will explore a recently uncovered phenomenon pertaining to metals - a large change in their fracture and plastic flow behavior arising from application of even nanoscale organic films onto their surface. It will study the changes produced in surface properties of the metals (e.g., surface and interface energy, surface stress, strength) by the films. Based on this study of the properties, and their relation to film attributes, e.g., chemistry, chain length, adsorption, it will identify the factors that control the flow and fracture phenomenon. The approach will combine advanced experimental techniques such as high-speed imaging and image analysis and nanoscale metrology, with atomistic modeling of interactions between organic molecule structure and metal surface attributes. The findings will impinge upon areas as diverse as materials processing, environmentally-assisted cracking and wear ? areas, where synergistic effects of mechanical loading and chemistry often play a key role. Controllability of the mechanochemical phenomenon by tailoring of the organic film chemistry will enable enhancements in material removal (e.g., cutting, comminution) and surface deformation (e.g., friction-stir processing) processes for metals.

By integrating a surface molecular probe (Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAMs)) and high-resolution in situ deformation analysis, with atomistic and continuum modeling of monolayer attributes and materials behavior, the research will address two closely-related hypotheses on the effect: 1) an adsorbed monolayer is sufficient to disrupt surface plastic flow and induce a local ductile-to-brittle transition; and 2) energetics of the monolayer-metal interface (surface stress vs. interface energy) controls the surface flow and the flow-fracture transition. The hypotheses exploration is guided by four objectives: 1) Utilize molecular self-assembly (SAMs) to anchor various monolayers onto metal surfaces, and characterize their attributes. The principal thermodynamic parameters of the surface, namely surface/interface energy and surface stress, will be varied via molecule chemistry and chain length; 2) Analyze the plastic-deformation response of the metal and associated flow dynamics, with and without the organic films, under controlled mechanical loading (e.g., simple shear, uniaxial tension) of specimens with high surface area-to-volume; 3) Develop a model for explaining the mechanochemical effect due to adsorbed monolayers ? from changes in nanoscale surface properties to mesoscale transitions in plastic flow; and 4) Integrate the experiments and modeling to understand how adsorbed films influence surface plasticity in metals, and what monolayer attributes control the mechanochemical effect. The study will be conducted specifically with commercially pure aluminum and iron, selected for their diversity in structure and deformation response, experimental suitability and technological interest. The findings will be of value for areas as diverse as materials processing, environmentally-assisted cracking and wear, wherein synergistic effects of mechanical loading and chemistry often play a key role.

During the day, plants and other photosynthetic organisms use solar energy to fix carbon dioxide and store excess carbon as carbon polymers such as starch or glycogen. At night, these storage carbons are broken down as the energy source for dark survival. The dark-to-light transition represents a universal environmental stress for photosynthetic lifeforms. For example, many metabolites necessary for photosynthetic reactions upon light exposure are limited or depleted due to metabolic reactions conducted in dark. It is important for photosynthetic organisms to have a mechanism in place to cope with this stress and ensure healthy photosynthetic performance upon exposure to light. How photosynthetic organisms achieve this dark-to-light transitions remains unclear. This research project applies cutting-edge biochemical and systems biology approaches to dissect the molecular mechanisms that allow this dark to light transition to occur in a model photosynthetic blue green alga. Knowledge gained from this research will how storage polymers like glycogen pave the way for carbon dioxide fixation to occur during the dark to light transition and eventually lead to ways to improve photosynthetic efficiency for crop productions. The research project also provides training opportunities for one postdoctoral researcher, one graduate student, and several undergraduate students. Components of this research are also integrated in a cluster education program as well as in the form of a special topics course on Synthetic Biology to broaden the training opportunity and strengthen scientific literacy for both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>Cyanobacteria experience drastic metabolic changes under daily light/dark cycles. The smooth metabolic transition from dark to light is crucial for healthy photosynthetic performance and the overall fitness of phototrophs. It is known that glycogen metabolism is involved in supporting the initiation of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle reactions during dark-to-light transitions in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. However, the molecular mechanisms of how glycogen metabolism supports photosynthesis are not clear. This project applies proteomics, metabolomics, metabolic flux analysis, and photochemical analyses to characterize the coping mechanism of cyanobacteria for the dark-to-light transition stress. The research activities will illustrate the status of a stalled CBB cycle, and understand how glycogen metabolism helps replenish and restart carbon fixation reactions, as well as protecting Photosystem I from photoinhibition during dark-to-light transitions. Discoveries from the research will significantly advance the understanding on a fundamental mechanism employed by photosynthetic lifeforms to cope with the dark-to-light transition stress and further our knowledge on energy balance between photosynthetic light reactions and carbon fixation.

These forests are also a vital part of global recycling of freshwater, and their loss has implications for food security for millions of people as well as global climate dynamics. Climate change is threatening these systems and there are concerns that as temperatures rise and rainfall becomes less reliable, these forests might be replaced by low-diversity grasslands. However, it is unclear what level of climate change might trigger a forest-to-grassland transition. Paleoecology can provide information about biological diversity in the past, and how biodiversity patterns changed during past warming events. This research project will investigate two periods of climate warming, one that lasted from about 8000 to 5000 years ago, and another even warmer time that lasted from 128,000 to 120,000 years ago. Ancient lakes build up sediments through time, and by taking a drill-core down through the sediment the history of the region can be captured in the lake mud. The researchers will analyze the fossil and chemical content of lake sediment cores from seven locations in the Amazon and Andes to establish how much the climate changed in the past, and whether those changes were enough to induce a shift from forest to grassland. By looking at a range of locations that vary in moisture, from very wet to quite dry, and degree of warming, the researchers will estimate how close the modern rainforest is to a forest-to-grassland transition. Additionally, new interactions between the collaborating research groups will include a co-taught paleoecology/paleoclimatology course, a sponsored category in a local film festival, and training of at least 10 undergraduates, two doctoral students, and one postdoctoral researcher. <br/><br/>The research will address a number of hypotheses relating to climate-vegetation responses such as flickering, teleconnections, ecosystem buffering, and tipping points. By using organic geochemical data to estimate paleotemperature, leaf wax isotopes to estimate precipitation, sediment chemistry to characterize droughts, fossil pollen to reconstruct vegetation, and charcoal to reconstruct fire frequency, the researchers will investigate ecosystem change under conditions as much as 2 degrees C (4 degrees F) warmer than the present. The Last Interglacial will provide an index of scale of change in traits, fire prevalence and community composition in a climate 1-2 degrees C warmer than modern. In the directly-dated Holocene, the data will assess sub-decadal variance in ecosystem indicators, and allow rates of change to be investigated. Currently, no high-resolution records of Amazonian temperature exist, so the novel approach of separating climatic change from that of ecological proxies will be transformational for quantitative neotropical paleoecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because environmental policies impact firm decisions, they provide a lens to test theories of firm interactions that contribute to our understanding of firm behavior. This research project will study the effects a policy which relocated firms located in densely urban areas to industrial locations  outside the city. The goal was to move polluting firms out of high population density areas so that they would affect fewer people. Because random drawings were held to assign plots at the new location to firms as industrial plots became available,  the randomization makes the firms that relocated earlier comparable to those that relocated later. This makes it possible to provide an improved understanding of how the presence of industrial activity at a variety of scales affects air quality and emissions in urban areas, workers? choices of where to live. Additionally, the proposal develops a new method of inferring air pollution levels from historical high-resolution satellite images which can be helpful whenever direct measurements are not available.  This innovative design allows the researchers allows researchers to assess the impact of industrial policy on the environment. The results of this research will provide inputs into  environmental policy and thus establish the US as the global leader in environment research and policy.<br/><br/>Understanding aggregate and distributional consequences of environmental policies is important to inform policies that balance the growth-pollution trade-off. We use the randomized removal of firms from city centers at different times to assess neighborhood-level policy impacts on a range of outcomes such as agglomeration, entry and exit, environmental quality, and land values. A key input to the analysis is fine resolution air quality measures spanning a fifteen year period. The proposed research will use deep learning methods applied to satellite imagery to create pollution measures at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. Furthermore, conditional on a firm?s assigned plot being in one of four size categories, the specific plot that a firm allotted was also random. This generates random variation in firms? neighbors, as well as in location characteristics such as proximity to infrastructure like roads. The project will estimate how different aspects of firm location impact firm outcomes and how these effects are heterogeneous depending on neighbors? characteristics. In studies of agglomeration and density, truly experimental variation is almost entirely absent so that most identification is either quasi-experimental or model-based. This study is the first to conduct a joint experimental analysis of how firm density impacts environmental quality, firm outcomes, and agglomeration. The results of this research will provide inputs into environmental policy and thus establish the US as the global leader in environment research and policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To understand the wide-ranging abilities of these moths to acquire fluid from long and short nectar tubes, a diverse team of researchers will investigate the structure, function, and biomechanics of the proboscis and its associated sucking pump. The team will focus on how wettability of the proboscis and it ability to take up fluid enable the many species of hawk moths to feed on a wide range of liquid resources and from flowers with different nectar-tube lengths. By coupling structural and functional characteristics of the proboscises with principles of biology and fluid dynamics, the team will provide insights into the diversification of hawk moths and their coevolution with the different species of flowering plants from which they acquire nectar and, in turn, pollinate. The results will provide strategies for novel bio-inspired engineering designs and products, such as new microfluidic probes. The resulting tools, techniques, and theories will be mutually beneficial for biological and engineering sciences and will involve integrated biological and engineering education of a new generation of scientists and teachers. In addition, the researchers will participate in public outreach activities related to the project, and students will lead citizen-science activities that provide hawk moth specimens for study and share results on a student-created webpage.<br/><br/>This project focuses on how proboscis structure in hawk moths relates to biomechanics of feeding and explores the evolutionary forces responsible for miniaturization and gigantism of the proboscis. More than 1460 species of hawk moths have evolved to exploit diverse fluid resources. Their proboscis ranges in length from a fraction of body length to more than twice body length, allowing hawk moths to feed from many species of flowering plants. The morphological structure of the tubular proboscis facilitates passive, spontaneous fluid uptake. The principal hypothesis is that structural variations of the proboscis and sucking pump provide physical determinants for diverse fluid-flow scenarios that enable hawk moths to use many liquid resources of different viscosities. Coupling morphology and wetting and transport properties of proboscises with biomechanics and energetics of fluid uptake will provide physical clues to the evolution and diversification of hawk moths. The objectives are to investigate (1) proboscis structure in relation to wettability, (2) influence of permeability and proboscis geometry on fluid uptake, (3) sucking-pump morphology as a basis for fluid-mechanics modeling, and (4) evolution of physico-chemical traits and the constraints imposed by physical determinants of fluid flow. The research is based on unique materials characterization technology and high-speed microscopy of live moths, supported by theoretical modeling. The team will include diverse talent and perspectives from all academic levels. Researchers will network with amateur lepidopterists to study hawk moths from around the country. Inspiration and skills exchanged between biologists and engineers will generate new techniques and approaches impacting biology, physics, and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solar energy conversion often begins with the transfer of energy or charge between two or more identical molecules that are packed together tightly. The close proximity and identical structures of the molecules make it very difficult to directly observe the first stages of the conversion process. In order to better understand these early events and how they affect solar energy conversion efficiency, Dr. Anna and her research team use sophisticated laser techniques to study pairs of molecules that represent more complicated systems. The team varies the relative distance and orientation of the two molecules in a well-defined way that allows them to distinguish changes caused by subtle differences in the way the two molecules interact with each other. The cutting-edge measurements they make provide new insight to aid in the design and development of new materials for solar energy conversion, including artificial photosynthetic complexes, photocatalysts, and organic photovoltaic materials. The project also involves educational and public outreach activities related to the research, including the development of new teaching modules for integration into graduate, undergraduate, and pre-college classrooms, as well as research opportunities and paid internships for undergraduates, pre-college students, and local area high school teachers. The teaching modules, research opportunities, and paid internships are designed to increase the participation of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, including underrepresented groups and first-generation college students.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on elucidating the interplay between exciton dynamics and charge transfer in a new family of pi-extended metallo-dipyrrin complexes. These systems have the potential to form excitonic states that undergo symmetry-breaking charge transfer, and therefore allow a systematic investigation of the interplay between energy- and charge-transfer processes. Dr. Anna and her students use pump-probe and coherent multidimensional spectroscopy in the visible and mid-IR spectral regions to study the different dipyrrin complexes and obtain a full characterization of the excited-state dynamics, structural rearrangement, and solvent reorganization involved in the symmetry-breaking charge transfer process. The research team uses a mixed spectral approach to probe the evolution of molecules in electronically excited states having charge-transfer character, harnessing the sensitivity of vibrational modes to the local electrostatic field. The team uses pump-probe spectroscopy to characterize population transfer and determine the branching ratios among different excited states in the dipyrrin complexes. The coherent multidimensional spectroscopy measurements provide more detailed information on the dynamics by alleviating spectral congestion, resolving vibrational modes in the excited state, and elucidating solvation dynamics and other relaxation processes. The comprehensive spectroscopic approach yields a deeper understanding of the combined role of intramolecular structural rearrangement and solvation dynamics in symmetry-breaking charge transfer processes that are important for solar energy conversion and other applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They will focus on realistic molecular complexes of considerable practical and fundamental importance and amenable to spectroscopic investigations, allowing for direct comparison between theory and experiment. Their studies will lead to more accurate description of the noncovalent intermolecular interactions, which play a major role in bulk liquids, molecular solids, and atmospheric chemistry, and the processes that occur in these environments.

Moreover, such a comparison will help them greatly with the assignment of the measured IR spectra, which for fluxional complexes is heavily reliant on theory. The intermolecular PESs of many molecular trimers, e.g., (H2O)3 and X-(H2O)2 (X = Cl, Br, I), exhibit multiple low-barrier tunneling pathways connecting the degenerate minima, which give rise to intricate patterns of tunneling splittings, observable in the measured spectra.

Development of these approaches for making measurements inside live cells will have broad application as we expect to obtain 1) benchmark data for in-cell NMR and EPR that can be used by other practitioners of these methodologies (biochemists, biophysicist) and 2) biological insight that may open new strategies for understanding protein function in cells and when bound by drugs.

Thus, a critical challenge faced by educators is to develop strategies that provide youth access to high quality STEM and ICT programs, and that motivate them to persist in STEM trajectories. Alarmingly, data suggest that positive STEM attitudes, especially among females and members of historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, tend to decline as youth transition from elementary to middle school and again from middle school to high school. Promisingly, informal STEM learning programs are thought to be important vehicles for addressing issues of underrepresentation, declining interest, and for facilitating sustained participation in STEM and ICT trajectories. However, it is largely unknown how and to what extent informal learning programs impact participants? awareness, interest, and engagement in STEM and ICT majors and careers. To address this knowledge gap, this synthesis project will investigate the impact of informal STEM and ICT programs on the cognitive and social emotional outcomes of youth participants. Importantly, this synthesis study differs from many other quantitative analyses and qualitative syntheses because one of the major goals of this project is to extract program design principles, technology-based innovations, theoretical underpinnings, and best practices from studies that exhibit exemplary evidence of rigorous research design and impact. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in STEM and ICT careers. <br/><br/>The goal of this synthesis study is to perform a quantitative meta-analysis and qualitative synthesis of research on youth participants of informal STEM and ICT programs.

(2) What are the program design principles, technology-based innovations, theoretical underpinnings, and best practices of rigorously designed informal, out-of-school time STEM and ICT programs that exhibit exemplary evidence of impact that can be adopted by STEM practitioners to maximize impact and broaden participation of underrepresented groups? To address the two main research questions, first, the project team will perform a systematic literature review and a quantitative meta-analysis to assess how and to what extent informal STEM and ICT learning experiences impact participants? awareness, interest, and engagement in STEM majors and careers. Second, the project team will use two validated rubrics to identify studies that exhibit exemplary evidence of research design quality and impact. From these studies, the team will conduct qualitative analyses to identify program design principles, technology-based innovations, theoretical underpinnings, and best practices for adoption by STEM practitioners to maximize impact and broaden participation of underrepresented groups. By focusing on programs with exemplary evidence of impact that specifically target females, underserved populations, and members of historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups, the findings can be used by practitioners to inform program design and practice, and to maximize the impact of underrepresented students.

However, data is often too large and complex to analyze in its entirety, and therefore different techniques are used to summarize the data in order to work with smaller, more manageable representations of it.  This project studies the data-comparison problem through the lens of mathematics, using geometric and topological signatures to represent these shapes concisely. This project will consider a variety of different kinds of shape data which live in some larger geometric or topological space (e.g., GIS trajectories, point sets, meshes, 3d scans, or graphs), and consider classes of algebraic, geometric, and graphical signatures which can be used to represent these shapes concisely.  The project draws primarily upon the nascent yet rapidly developing area of topological data analysis, where tools from topology like homology or homotopy are combined with geometric measures to create robust analysis tools for analyzing the shape of data. Graduate and undergraduate students will be tightly integrated into the project, and special efforts will be made to involve students from underrepresented groups. Additional efforts by the research team include planning a workshop focused on women in this field, as well as broadening diversity and inclusion efforts in their own universities.<br/><br/>The project focuses on shapes that have some common underlying annotation framework on top of the signature, which is usually additional structural or geometric information from the original embedding. The research consists of two major components.  In the first, the investigators are initiating a principled study of algorithms and approaches to develop a unified framework which leverages multiple signatures for shape comparison. The goal of this phase is to provide theoretical results as well as empirical evaluations on a variety of data sets and signatures. The second major component of the project studies inverse problems, which aim to reconstruct shapes from a combination of signatures.  Such problems are notoriously difficult for geometric or topological signatures, as they are necessarily lossy and remove certain types of information.  During the course of the project, the investigators are also developing a shape signatures toolkit that enables computation of a range of signatures and distances, adding to the software both existing notions of distance and new ones developed over the course of the project.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algorithmic Foundations Core Program and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reactive magnesium oxide cement (RMC) is one of the most promising and environmentally friendly alternatives to ordinary Portland cement as a modern concrete binder. The advantages of RMC include low-cost and low carbon footprint compared to conventional cements. RMC achieves its strength by forming different magnesium carbonate phases as binding agents by reacting with carbon dioxide and water. However, the strength and durability properties of existing RMCs exhibit significant variations, slowing their adoption by construction industry. This research will address the following two technical challenges: (i) understanding the fundamental processes that govern the formation of dense magnesium carbonate phases using novel experimental testing and computer simulation; and (ii) innovation of durable RMC-based composites with high strength by incorporating corrosion-resistant micro- and macro-fibers. In this project, an outreach program for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students will be implemented in order to disseminate knowledge on low-carbon structural materials for the construction industry, and train next generation students and engineers with sustainable infrastructure engineering backgrounds. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this research is to tailor the carbonation products of reactive magnesium oxide cement by maneuvering thermodynamic and kinetic precipitation pathways in order to achieve high-performance RMC-based composites. RMC can be produced from low-temperature (500-1000 °C) calcination of either magnesite deposits or brucite precipitates from reject brine. Thus, it is deemed a more sustainable binder to ordinary Portland cement, whose production accounts for 7% of the global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Yet, the large specific volume variability of the different reaction products of RMC and the vulnerability of the embedded rebars to corrosion due to an absence or quick loss of the passivating oxide layer hindered its widespread application in the construction practice. To address these longstanding challenges, this research offers a combined experimental and computational research plan with two objectives: (i) to guide the nucleation and growth pathways via nanoscale interfacial energy considerations with non-reactive seeds (quartz, calcite, magnesite, and dolomite) to avoid the precipitation of low-density hydrated magnesium carbonate phases and hence reducing the volume change by modulating the competition between thermodynamics and kinetics driving forces, and (ii) to employ this fundamental knowledge to develop dense RMC-based fiber-reinforced structural composites that are less permeable and more resistant to cracking and corrosion. This approach exploits the fundamentals of the nucleation and growth process at the nanoscale, rather than case-by-case testing of different mix designs and processing conditions, to achieve robust composite performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Being incorporated into the radiation transfer codes presently in use in the astrophysics community, this information will enable astronomers to quantify the abundance of these molecules in pre-stellar cores and proto-stellar jets. The standard quantum calculations of rotationally inelastic collisions become prohibitively demanding at higher collision energies and for heavier molecules, such as the interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs). To overcome this obstacle, it is proposed to develop a practical computational treatment of scattering where the relative motion of collision partners is described classically, while their internal degrees of freedom (rotation, vibration) are still described quantum mechanically. This approach is expected to be both accurate and computationally affordable. <br/><br/>For the successful quantitative interpretation of astrophysical observations it is imperative to know cross sections for collisional state-to-state excitation/quenching of the light-emitting molecules by typical background gasses, such as He and H2, across a broad range of temperatures.

These forests are also a vital part of global recycling of freshwater, and their loss has implications for food security for millions of people as well as global climate dynamics. Climate change is threatening these systems and there are concerns that as temperatures rise and rainfall becomes less reliable, these forests might be replaced by low-diversity grasslands. However, it is unclear what level of climate change might trigger a forest-to-grassland transition. Paleoecology can provide information about biological diversity in the past, and how biodiversity patterns changed during past warming events. This research project will investigate two periods of climate warming, one that lasted from about 8000 to 5000 years ago, and another even warmer time that lasted from 128,000 to 120,000 years ago. Ancient lakes build up sediments through time, and by taking a drill-core down through the sediment the history of the region can be captured in the lake mud. The researchers will analyze the fossil and chemical content of lake sediment cores from seven locations in the Amazon and Andes to establish how much the climate changed in the past, and whether those changes were enough to induce a shift from forest to grassland. By looking at a range of locations that vary in moisture, from very wet to quite dry, and degree of warming, the researchers will estimate how close the modern rainforest is to a forest-to-grassland transition. Additionally, new interactions between the collaborating research groups will include a co-taught paleoecology/paleoclimatology course, a sponsored category in a local film festival, and training of at least 10 undergraduates, two doctoral students, and one postdoctoral researcher. <br/><br/>The research will address a number of hypotheses relating to climate-vegetation responses such as flickering, teleconnections, ecosystem buffering, and tipping points. By using organic geochemical data to estimate paleotemperature, leaf wax isotopes to estimate precipitation, sediment chemistry to characterize droughts, fossil pollen to reconstruct vegetation, and charcoal to reconstruct fire frequency, the researchers will investigate ecosystem change under conditions as much as 2 degrees C (4 degrees F) warmer than the present. The Last Interglacial will provide an index of scale of change in traits, fire prevalence and community composition in a climate 1-2 degrees C warmer than modern.

Schatz of Northwestern University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop theory and models that describe the transfer of energy between molecules that is mediated by metal nanoparticles (typically silver, gold or aluminum) that show strong optical absorption properties known as plasmon excitation.   The theory builds from the past history of research on energy transfer, but here is adapted to problems at the leading edge of science, in which energy transfer can extend over distances from 10s of nm to mm, involves strong coupling where traditional perturbation theory approaches can break down, and where quantum effects provide opportunities for making fundamental changes to the energy transfer process. Energy transfer involving metal nanoparticles is important in emerging optical technologies, including topics related to optical switching, in the development of new types of optical devices, in single photon emitters, and in secure communications.  Schatz will also study  energy transfer and other properties associated with quantum light including the emission, absorption and energy transfer involving two entangled photons. The students and postdocs who work on this project include a significant number of women and minorities, and they will acquire unique skills that they can use to launch their own careers. In addition, there will be outreach to K-12 groups, undergraduate training, numerous seminars and workshops, and interactions with the public.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed work on energy transfer mediated by metal nanoparticles is a relatively new field where analytical theory based on quantum mechanics is essential. In addition to analytical theory, the research will pursue computational algorithms for using the theory, and applications of the theory to describe experiments done by experimental collaborators.  The theory includes the description of: (1) donor-acceptor energy transfer near arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles where energy transfer can be mediated by optical modes of the lattice, and where issues of coherence and strong light-matter interactions can be tuned by controlling array structural parameters and emitter/absorber concentrations; (2) energy transfer mediated by  individual or a few nanoparticles where Schatz will develop a full quantum electrodynamics formalism that incorporates plasmonic, excitonic and electromagnetic states on equal footing and which will provide the capability of describing quantum effects under circumstances where perturbation-theory based energy transfer theory breaks down; (3) energy transfer associated with quantum light that is coupled to entangled plasmons, including donor-acceptor energy transfer in which interference between the entangled photons modulates the rate.

Organofluorine compounds are used as medicinal agents, insecticides, refrigerants, fire-fighting foam and stain-protective coatings for furniture and carpet. The C?F bond is especially strong and resistant to cleavage. As a consequence, organofluorines can persist and accumulate in the environment and physiologically. This project seeks ways to chemically degrade organofluorines by breaking the relatively unreactive C-F bonds and replacing all the F atoms with H atoms. The methods are to utilize rhodium and iridium catalysts to insert into the C-F bond, with molecular hydrogen serving as the reductant and H source. The project contains a strong educational component in which undergraduate and graduate students are trained for future careers in science and technology. For outreach, Dr. Lu will partner with science teachers at Antwatin Middle School with a majority of underrepresented students (50% African American, 26% Hispanic) to develop hands-on experiments related to energy and sustainability.<br/><br/>Heterobimetallic Group 9 (Rh or Ir) complexes where the transition-metal has a formally zero or subvalent oxidation state and is braced are being investigated as reagents and catalysts for heat- or light-activated hydrodefluorination reactions.

The efficient preparation and further modification of the nitrogen-containing heterocycles frequently is necessary in the industrial production of many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, the processes that are presently used for these transformations are often inefficient and do not exactly target the chemical bonds that must be manipulated. To rectify this problem, frameworks containing metal atoms bonded to boron or aluminum atoms are constructed. The boron or aluminum atoms can capture a nitrogen atom and hold the nitrogen-containing heterocycle in a very controlled geometry that allows the metal atom to activate specific chemical bonds. This permits precise control of the nitrogen-containing heterocycle. The project involves a network of collaborators, including Professor Anna Larsen at Ithaca College and Assistant Professor Miles Johnson at the University of Richmond, both faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions. The project also aims to increase the participation of students from underrepresented groups through graduate student recruitment efforts and outreach with the local secondary schools.<br/><br/>The theme of this project involves the synergistic use of the Lewis acidity of boryl or aluminyl sites bonded to transition metals and incorporated into pincer type ligands. It exploits the ability of boryl or an aluminyl units to capture the nitrogenous group in an azine substrate. This positions the transition metal to activate a specific C-H bond, which is topologically distinct from traditional C-H activation approaches. To develop a library of new ligands, 1,2-pyrrolediyl will be utilized as a key building block in the synthesis of pincer type ligands that contain the boryl or aluminyl moieties. Using these ligands, rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium complexes will be prepared and their ability to activate C-H bonds will be investigated. The mechanistic roles of B or Al in shuttling organic fragments to and from the transition metal and their involvement in the C-H activation process will be probed.

Modern society relies extensively on engineering applications involving transmission of waves. Cell phone communications, satellite data transmissions and information on the internet - all sent along thousands of miles of glass fiber cables - are controlled by mathematics describing the motion of waves. A striking feature of the wave propagation, and the topic of this project, is its universality. In fact, waves propagating on astronomical scales such as the gravitational waves detected by LIGO, as well as waves on a microscopic scale such as those emitted by atoms in the form of electromagnetic radiation in a laser, are governed by exactly the same mathematical theories. It is therefore of the utmost strategic importance for the well-being and safety of the society at large to train young specialists in the PI?s area of research; this is also one of the goals of this project. Experience shows that this broader impact can only be achieved by scientists who are actively working at the frontier of knowledge. <br/><br/>The PI recently completed a perturbative analysis of equivariant critical wave maps into the 2-sphere, without any symmetry assumptions on the perturbations. This nonlinear analysis is based on the semi-classical representations of wave functions for Bessel-type potentials which the PI developed more than a decade ago in the context of the Price law in general relativity. Application of this new technique is planned to other nonlinear evolution equations, which admit separation of variables and a reduction to an infinite system of coupled semi-classical wave equations. The role of the semi-classical parameter h is typically played by the reciprocal of the angular momentum. Another area in which spectral theory is now coming to the fore is the rapidly developing field of asymptotic stability of topological solitons, specifically of kink solutions for one-dimensional scalar fields. Jointly with others, the PI recently demonstrated how to treat Klein-Gordon equations with a nongeneric potential and long-range nonlinearities. The basic scalar field equations each exhibit a nongeneric potential with a threshold resonance and are therefore of the type to be considered in this project. The PI's work on quasi-periodic localization and its ramifications will be continued. A particularly challenging novel perspective will be offered by nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems, where there are strong indications that it is possible to bring Anderson localization techniques to bear.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order for the field to fully live up to its promise, the experimental realization of ultra-strong light-matter coupling must be accompanied by high-quality theoretical descriptions of the properties of polaritonic features. The DePrince group will develop a robust, reliable, and systematically improvable framework for the ab initio description of polaritonic structure. The theories and software that will be developed will fill a gap in the existing computational tool kit for the high-accuracy description of polariton-mediated processes. Such tools have the potential to facilitate the rational design of new polariton-based technologies relevant to light harvesting, super conductivity, and quantum information science. All software developed under this program will be released in a free and open-source manner. Under this award, the DePrince group also will be developing readily accessible online educational materials for quantum chemistry and computer science education.<br/> <br/>Dr. DePrince and his team will take a many-body approach to the polaritonic structure problem, with an emphasis on the equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) hierarchy of methods. Polaritonic formulations of excitation-energy (EE), ionization potential (IP), and electron affinity (EA) EOM-CC theory and software will be developed and applied to a variety of problems involving cavity-bound molecules. Ab initio descriptions of strong and ultra-strong light-matter coupling are rare, with only a few existing examples of many-body approaches to this problem having recently emerged. Given that the exact form of the electron-photon exchange-correlation functional in polaritonic formulations of density functional theory (DFT) is unknown, it appears that many-body methods such as the EOM-CC approaches that will be developed under this program offer the only route to universally reliable and systematically improvable descriptions of cavity-molecule interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computer simulations of biological molecules can spur the design and optimization of engineered proteins and biomimetic nanomaterials. However, obtaining dynamical information at a reasonable computational cost is limited by the time required to overcome kinetic bottlenecks that characterize rare events in biological systems. Dr. McCarty and his research group will leverage a variational formalism, based on the statistical mechanics of rare events, to compute long-time dynamical observables for proteins in solution and biochemical reactions. A goal of this work is to provide a computational framework to bridge the gap between computer simulations and experiments that probe long-time dynamics. The methods developed by Dr. McCarty?s group will be made accessible to experimental and computational research groups and will provide new tools for experimentalists to interpret dynamical measurements. Dr. McCarty?s research will offer increased access and opportunities for undergraduates to engage in computational biochemistry research. An outcome of the planned activities is expected to be the integration of computational advances into the undergraduate biochemistry lab, pairing computer simulation with experimental mutational screening data.<br/><br/>Enhanced sampling methods in molecular simulations use an external bias potential to more efficiently sample state space. Dr. McCarty will make use of a variational approach to enhanced sampling in which an external bias potential accelerates rare-event transitions along a low-dimensional reaction coordinate. The bias potential is constructed on-the-fly by optimizing a set of variational parameters in an iterative procedure. Through algorithmic advances, benchmarking, and applications of this variational formalism, Dr. McCarty?s work will extend the scope of the variational approach into two key areas important for understanding macromolecular dynamics and enzyme reaction rates. (i) Dr. McCarty will be developing methods to predict the mean-first-passage times of enzymatic reactions from ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. (ii) Dr. McCarty will be developing an approach to extract time correlation functions from time-series data obtained from biased classical (MD) trajectories that is expected to efficiently compute NMR relaxation rates. In both of these areas, dynamic observables are computed by rescaling the biased simulation time according to the statistical mechanics of rare events. The orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency that will likely be afforded by Dr. McCarty?s work has the potential to accelerate the capabilities of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) hybrid simulations for drug development and protein engineering, and to ultimately provide a new tool for researchers to interpret dynamical NMR measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, flooding induces several stresses: limited oxygen availability, changes in temperature, reduced light. Anoxia, the removal of oxygen, is a consequence of waterlogging and submergence of plants. During this stress, plant tissues significantly reduce the rate of energy production, affecting many aspects of metabolism. This project examines how fluctuations in calcium (Ca) within plant cells can impact anoxia tolerance. The investigators have discovered that removal of a specific Ca transporter appears to buffer the plant against anoxic conditions. Here imaging experiments will visually address how this change effects how Ca moves, where it is localized, and how the temporal and spatial changes in Ca can impact anoxia tolerance. To complement these photographic approaches, biochemical and genetic experiments will address the mechanisms of Ca movement. Approaches to measure changes in protein and nucleic acids will be used to further define how removal of a specific Ca transporter can impact the plant?s utilization of energy. One broad impact of this work will be the development of a unique research collaboration with faculty and students from Houston Community College (HCC). HCC is an open-admission, public school that while serving one of the most diverse populations in the US, does not usually provide research experiences. These HCC students will both learn and contribute to this project. The efforts of this work will lead to a better understanding of how plants adapt to their environment. In the future, engineering-modulated Ca movement in plants could circumvent adverse effects of anoxic conditions to mitigate climate change-induced crop loss.<br/><br/>Oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) and absence (anoxia) are severe physiological stresses in plants. Most commonly they occur when extreme weather events lead to flooding, which causes widespread crop losses. Membrane transporters may be essential components of anoxia tolerance because they are involved in signal transduction and regulation of metabolic processes. Mutations in the Arabidopsis vacuolar cation/proton exchangers (CAXs) cause striking tolerance to anoxia. This robust phenotype was unexpected: a loss-of-function mutation causing a gain of function. The majority of CAX RNAs are unchanged during hypoxia, highlighting the limits of RNA profiling as an exclusive means of gene discovery. A series of genetic, omics, membrane transport, physiological, cell and elemental imaging experiments will be used to characterize the role of CAXs during anoxia that will demonstrate their role in signaling, cation transport and metabolism. A highly skilled, diverse team will use a multi-disciplinary approach including plant genetics, membrane transport and elemental imaging. As part of the broader impacts, and as a further means of discovery, a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) at Houston Community College (HCC) will be implemented. HCC is an open-admission public school that, while serving one of the most diverse populations in the US, does not typically provide research experiences. In short, characterizing the role of CAXs in anoxia tolerance will lead to a greater understanding of plant signal transduction. Furthermore, this knowledge will eventually aid in the development of flood-resistant crop plants, reducing crop loss during extreme weather events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The complexity of such coordination became obvious in the recent events of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017 as well as earlier ones, such as Katrina and Rita in 2005, which created significant awareness in the shortcomings in existing response plans.  This research is motivated by the recognition of the stakeholders involved and their individual objectives in the course of decision-making for preparedness planning activities upon an imminent hurricane. As commonly witnessed in real situations, conflicting motivations of stakeholders can lead to decisions driven by individual objectives rather than what is best under a system view, and, thus, lead to unintended consequences. One main reason for this occurrence is the current paradigm of emergency logistics that has largely overlooked the important interdependence between evacuation (demand) and relief (supply) sides.  This grant will investigate such integration from the perspective of both cost- and operation-effectiveness in emergency preparedness planning. If successful, the outcome of this grant will facilitate future development of sophisticated and easy-to-use decision support tools for emergency logistics planners. It will help to bring services to a wider group of citizens by making it possible to move out of harm?s way efficiently in case of an impending disaster. Undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups will be engaged and trained with state-of-the-art tools and means to conduct socially impactful research.  <br/><br/>While significant advances have been made in past decades, comprehensive efforts to understand and leverage the linkage between demand and supply sides within an integrated framework do not exist. Especially in the presence of uncertainty that carries from hurricane characteristics to supply planning through evacuation decision-making and evacuee behavior presents a major challenge in optimization when employing an integrated systems framework. This grant addresses this critical gap in theory and practice. This work will be the first to systematically explore the integration of demand and supply sides in infrastructure design and operations planning for emergency preparedness/response logistics. The overall system will be considered in two layers of decisions within an optimization framework: strategic infrastructure related and tactical/operational decisions by explicitly modeling uncertainties based on potential disaster events and evacuee behavior. Thus, collectively, the components of the research fully capture the stakeholder activities, and rather than planning for their actions independently, as is commonly done in existing literature, this research aims to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness at the system level. The methodology brings together new perspectives and purpose to investigate new and challenging optimization models under uncertainty and solution algorithms for their optimal solutions and it will also establish a framework to examine the benefits of integration over the existing approaches by addressing optimization of current decision-making in a comparable manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additive manufacturing by direct writing is the process of producing a patterned film from a digital computer model without the need for a mask or other part-specific tooling. The technique has the potential to revolutionize the way things are made because it can dramatically lower the cost for making patterned films for low production volume parts or even allow custom geometries for each part. There are many existing direct-write manufacturing processes that can produce patterned films. However, they generally require high temperature which can damage the substrate that the films are deposited on and this is particularly problematic for ceramic films since the processing temperatures are usually very high. This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of a room temperature direct-write additive manufacturing process for depositing ceramics. This process will enable the deposition of high-quality ceramic films at room temperature. Combined with metal films that can be deposited using the same process, these ceramic films can be use in hybrid devices that require multiple materials such as sensors, actuators, and rechargeable batteries. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research requires expertise in both experimental and computational materials science. The multi-disciplinary approach will train students in an areas that can contribute immediately to industry and outreach activities that will broaden participation of female engineering students in research and positively impact engineering education.<br/> <br/>The micro cold spray process offers unique advantages compared to existing manufacturing processes for depositing thick films of metals and ceramics: 1) Deposition occurs at or near room temperature allowing for the use of film materials and substrates that are temperature sensitive; 2) It is possible to deposit oxygen-sensitive and very high melting temperature metals without highly specialized and expensive equipment; 3) Non-equilibrium mixtures of materials can be deposited onto a wide range of substrate materials with minimal surface preparation. However, experiments have shown that micro cold spray produces high quality ceramic films only over a narrow window of processing parameters. The existing empirical approach was required because the mechanism(s) for particle bonding remain poorly understood. A fundamental understanding of the physics of film formation would allow the establishment of a processing window a priori that would dramatically reduce the number of experiments required to produce high quality patterned thick ceramic films using micro cold spray. An understanding of the factors that affect film deposition by micro cold spray requires the study of new fundamental science to advance the manufacturing process because the combination of extremely high strain rates, large strains, primarily compressive stress states, and locally high temperatures that arise during particle impact for micro cold spray are unique in ceramics processing and have not been previously explored. This grant uses a combined experimental and molecular dynamics simulation-based approach to establish the scientific underpinnings advancing this manufacturing process and provides a fundamental understanding of the particle and agglomerate deformation mechanisms that lead to film formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fog consists of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air at or near the Earth?s surface and is considered as a type of low-lying cloud. Fog forms in high-elevation complex terrain as frequently as over water bodies but is less understood. Because of its impacts on visibility, fog is the second most common cause of weather-related aviation accidents after strong wind events. Fog forecasts have significant impacts on human activities, transportation, air quality, human health, and agriculture. Despite the impacts of fog and historical fog research, fog prediction remains a challenge for weather prediction because of complex interactions between land, water, and atmospheric conditions in fog formation. Poor fog forecasting skills reflect a lack of understanding of fog formation, development, and dissipation, which is the focus of the research. This study is expected to contribute to improving fog forecasting in mountainous regions, enhancing public awareness of fog-weather conditions, and information for decision-making. The project involves the participation of multiple institutions nationally and internationally with graduate and undergraduate training in both classrooms and the field.<br/><br/>The overarching goals of the CFACT project are to 1) investigate cold fog development and environment conditions in complex terrain with latest observation technology, 2) improve microphysical parameterizations and visibility algorithms used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and 3) develop data-assimilation and analysis methods for current and next-generation (e.g., sub-kilometer scale) NWP models. The field project will be conducted in Heber Valley, Utah, during January and February 2022 with deployment of a network of ground-based in-situ instruments and remote sensing platforms to obtain comprehensive measurements of thermodynamic profiling, cloud microphysics, physical and chemical properties of aerosols, and dynamics of the environment. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with various physical parameterizations and coupled land-atmosphere data assimilation capabilities will be used to facilitate the studies for improved fog prediction with NWP models. It is anticipated that the efforts will result in 1) improved understanding of cold-fog processes in complex terrain, 2) an evaluation of the bulk nucleation conditions that affect cold-fog microphysics related to visibility prediction, 3) identification of knowledge gaps in the micro- to synoptic- scale kinematic and thermodynamic processes associated with cold-fog life cycles in heterogeneous complex terrain, 4) understanding of interactions between physical (e.g., particle growth, nucleation, condensation, radiation) and dynamic mechanisms (e.g., turbulence, vertical air velocities, and wave motions) during the lifecycle of a fog event,  5) an evaluation of how land-surface conditions, especially snow on the ground, affect near-surface and boundary-layer atmospheric processes including the critical role of the surface radiative balance in cold-fog formation and evolution, and  6) improvement of microscales to mesoscales NWP-model simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, data is often too large and complex to analyze in its entirety, and therefore different techniques are used to summarize the data in order to work with smaller, more manageable representations of it.  This project studies the data-comparison problem through the lens of mathematics, using geometric and topological signatures to represent these shapes concisely. This project will consider a variety of different kinds of shape data which live in some larger geometric or topological space (e.g., GIS trajectories, point sets, meshes, 3d scans, or graphs), and consider classes of algebraic, geometric, and graphical signatures which can be used to represent these shapes concisely.  The project draws primarily upon the nascent yet rapidly developing area of topological data analysis, where tools from topology like homology or homotopy are combined with geometric measures to create robust analysis tools for analyzing the shape of data. Graduate and undergraduate students will be tightly integrated into the project, and special efforts will be made to involve students from underrepresented groups. Additional efforts by the research team include planning a workshop focused on women in this field, as well as broadening diversity and inclusion efforts in their own universities.<br/><br/>The project focuses on shapes that have some common underlying annotation framework on top of the signature, which is usually additional structural or geometric information from the original embedding. The research consists of two major components.  In the first, the investigators are initiating a principled study of algorithms and approaches to develop a unified framework which leverages multiple signatures for shape comparison. The goal of this phase is to provide theoretical results as well as empirical evaluations on a variety of data sets and signatures. The second major component of the project studies inverse problems, which aim to reconstruct shapes from a combination of signatures.  Such problems are notoriously difficult for geometric or topological signatures, as they are necessarily lossy and remove certain types of information.  During the course of the project, the investigators are also developing a shape signatures toolkit that enables computation of a range of signatures and distances, adding to the software both existing notions of distance and new ones developed over the course of the project.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algorithmic Foundations Core Program and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to the noisy and imprecise nature of data, these analyses need to be performed in the presence of uncertainty. Bayesian networks constitute one model that can be used to represent noisy and imprecise data, and that has been employed in applications ranging from atomic-level systems to cosmology, healthcare, and in various engineering domains such as transportation, manufacturing, civil infrastructure, and aerospace systems. In the last decade, there has also been tremendous interest in the field of quantum computing due to its superior computational performance over conventional computing paradigms in solving certain types of problems. This project is investigating efficient representation and simulation of Bayesian networks in the quantum-computing paradigm. The results from this project are being incorporated into STEM courses. Multiple undergraduate and graduate students are being trained as part of this project, and several short teaching modules are being developed to train high-school students in quantum computing through annual summer camps. <br/><br/>The proposed project investigates the fundamental question of simulating a Quantum Bayesian Network (QBN) on currently available Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The proposed research is investigating a multi-pronged approach for efficient QBN simulation. First, a novel QBN representation framework through rotation angle decomposition, which has a lower analysis complexity without losing the accuracy is being investigated. Second, a mixed optimization-reinforcement learning approach for transpilation is being investigated for combined qubit placement and routing problem to efficiently map any given QBN circuit on to gate-based hardware architectures. Finally, a non-parametric statistical approach is being investigated to obtain an empirical relationship between QBN complexity and the number of quantum circuit runs required for a desired accuracy in QBN state probabilities. The proposed methods are not limited to quantum Bayesian networks but are generic and applicable to any quantum algorithm.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will overcome such challenges by developing bioinformatic methods that incorporate unique characteristics of data and fully utilize publicly available data, providing comprehensive characterization and quantification of PTMs. This development will enhance fundamental understanding of functional proteomics in many biological areas, including plant science, biomedicine, and microbiology.

Textiles are often substrates susceptible to microbial growth under appropriate temperature, humidity, and nutrient conditions. Therefore, antimicrobial textiles have become a necessity, especially for critical applications such as personal protective equipment or PPE, sportwear and air filters. However, current antimicrobial agents and manufacturing technologies suffer from one or more key limitations, for example, low antimicrobial activity, poor durability, and lack of manufacturing scalability. This grant supports fundamental research to bridge the knowledge gap in scalable manufacturing of novel antimicrobial textiles with high activity and durability. This project establishes a new paradigm for the economical production of antimicrobial personal protective equipment and air filters in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises. This project provides transferable knowledge for the manufacturing of other functional textiles. The results from this project promote the progress of science and benefit the U.S. textile industry, economy, national health and welfare. Furthermore, this multidisciplinary project involves material science, chemistry, nanotechnology and manufacturing science and provides research opportunities for women and underrepresented minority students. The integrated education and outreach activities promote engineering education for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Silver nanoparticles have been researched as promising antimicrobial agents for protective textile applications. However, to realize practical low-cost and large-scale manufacturing of silver nanoparticle-functionalized textiles, fundamental understanding is still lacking on a series of key factors, including the heterogeneous interactions between the nanoparticle and fabrics, the engineering of the nanoparticle properties, and the manufacturing process that allows for mass production. To gain such basic knowledge, this project performs fundamental investigations into a continuous and scalable production process toward the manufacturing of silver nanoparticle-decorated textiles, by integrating electroless plating of silver nanoparticles with roll-to-roll manufacturing. The research generates new knowledge in (1) interfacial nucleation of silver nanoparticles assisted with biocompatible molecules such as polydopamine, which functions as an adhesive and reducing agent to facilitate the growth of the silver nanoparticles during electroless plating on different textile surfaces; (2) the growth mechanisms of silver nanoparticles on textiles for optimized antimicrobial potency; and (3) how fabric materials and structures impact the roll-to-roll coating quality.

As the number of electric machines grows rapidly in response to less carbon dioxide emissions, a large number of electric machines are connected to form electric machine networks.  However, traditional CMFD were developed based on individual machine sensors, which requires a large number of sensors and do not comprehensively consider fault and degradation propagation. This limitation will be in part resolved by coordinated monitoring and analysis of strategically-placed electrical waveform sensors in power networks. The intellectual merits of the project include integrating high-fidelity physical model of electric machine networks to signature-based CMFD for improved accuracy and robustness. The broader impacts of the project include advancing the research experiences for K-12 and undergraduate students including underrepresented students. The research will be integrated into the undergraduate and graduate electric power engineering curriculum to educate future engineers who will have the skills and knowledge to meet the emerging needs of the industry. <br/><br/>The proposed physics-guided signature-based approach for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis (CMFD) of electric machine networks will advance the literature in a new direction compared to the traditional approach based on individual machine sensors. Four specific objectives will be pursued: (1) Assess the electrical waveform signature due to faults and degradation that will build a technical foundation for the proposed CMFD approach. (2) Create a high-fidelity physical model of electric machine networks that reflects not only the fault, degradation and nonlinearity of the machine, but also waveform propagation due to faults and degradation. (3) Design a physics-guided signature-based method that leverages the waveform propagation model to more effectively and efficiently identify and locate faults or degradation source in electric machine networks.

We recognize that promoting well-being among faculty and students must be a central focus rather than an afterthought of professional education. Accordingly, this project will advance cultures of well-being in engineering education by understanding faculty members? personal experiences of coping with negative emotions and failure within their professional context. Engineering faculty members are highly influential to students who seek their guidance to understand what it means to become an engineer. Faculty are best positioned to influence healthy cultures of engineering education when their own emotional needs are met. Therefore, this project will examine how faculty members meet their well-being needs and how they use their influence to nurture or inhibit cultures that allow for engineering students to experience well-being. This project aims to transform how faculty relationally connect with students and other faculty and staff by transforming the ways that they understand themselves. In addition to the research plan, which includes intensive interviews with engineering faculty at multiple institutions, this project will also provide direct training to faculty on coping with failures and preserving a positive professional identity. In line with the PI?s career mission, this project will develop and define a scholarship of care within engineering education research that influences national and local policies of well-being through research-informed insights.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will address two significant gaps in extant literature: 1) the role of failure and negative emotions in facilitating or mitigating cultural patterns of well-being; 2) the complex, dynamic nature of the lived emotional experiences of engineering faculty. This project is organized around the following objectives:<br/>Objective 1: Examine social and individual experiences of failure and negative emotions in engineering faculty. <br/>Objective 2: Characterize the link between faculty?s emotional experience and their surrounding cultures of well-being. <br/>Objective 3: Establish a framework to provide training for engineering programs to establish cultures that support healthy strategies for coping with professional failure. <br/><br/>This project will use a qualitative mixed-methods approach that embeds an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) study that examines the lived experiences of professional failure and negative emotions in engineering faculty (Objective 1) within a constructivist grounded theory (CGT) analysis that generates a theoretical model of the relationships between faculty emotional regulation and cultures of well-being (Objective 2). The education plan to develop faculty training on regulating emotions related to professional failure (Objective 3) will be interwoven with the research focus to change cultures of well-being (Objective 2). This study will occur at three purposefully selected institutions and involve 10-12 faculty participants for the IPA study, 18-22 participants that are interviewed twice for the CGT study (36-44 total interviews), and a three-module training series to be delivered at four institutions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) in the Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) Division of Engineering (ENG), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, Subotnik will develop new and powerful algorithms that quantify exactly how molecules with nuclei and spins relax after they have been excited by light.  Subotnik will test both theoretically and computationally which atoms move during relaxation, and will explore the possibility that this atomic motion can lead to a promotion of spin-selectivity for long periods of time.   All of the algorithmic developments will be released to the public in an open source fashion.  This research program lies at the cutting edge of physical chemistry and spin-chemistry, and in the long term, research here has the potential to help create an entirely new form of device electronics based on electronic spin (so-called spintronics) unlike conventional devices based on electronic charge. The broader impacts include the Subotnik group's support for bringing undergraduate researchers into the lab, with a special emphasis on introducing members of underrepresented groups to hands-on science.  The Subotnik research team also invites these students to participate the annual Penn Conference in Theoretical Chemistry (PCTC). <br/><br/>Subotnik will develop a semi-classical algorithm for quantifying how coupled nuclear-electronic systems prepared out of equilibrium relax in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the electronic Hamiltonian becomes complex-valued and the nature of electronic transitions becomes very difficult for modern algorithms because (i) the direction of momentum rescaling becomes unclear and (ii) the presence of Berry magnetic forces can lead to novel reaction pathways.  Subotnik is constructing and benchmarking a novel, reliable surface hopping approach to treat such conditions, both for the case of doublets (with two electronic states) as well as for the case of singlet-triplet crossings (with four electronic states).

A careful investigation into already-at-scale data science initiatives shows that such tools and curriculum are largely not accessible to individuals with disabilities, nor do they have a strong foundation of human factors evidence supporting their designs. These issues are crucial and must be resolved for workforce equity and a diverse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pipeline. <br/><br/>This project will bring together investigators in computer science, mechanical engineering, education, social science, and cognitive neuroscience to rethink the tools that support the teaching and learning of data science at the high school level. The overarching goal will be to create and evaluate data science tools and curriculum that are not just in legal compliance for accessibility, but that carefully take into account the needs of learners, including those with disabilities. This project will involve numerous strategic partnerships including two schools for students with disabilities, the Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology Center, and an engaged advisory board representing computing accessibility (AccessComputing), data science industry (RStudio), and data science governance (Association for Computing Machinery Data Science Task Force). The rigorous research plan will include iterative, user-focused development, empirical quantitative investigations, qualitative focus groups, and a culminating in-classroom field study, targeting an estimated total of 385 students, 105 teachers, and 30 industry professionals as participants across all studies. By creating, deploying, and rigorously evaluating the first data science tool and curriculum that is accessible to all, the project intends to help create equitable pathways for all students to enter the field of data science.

The first aim of this proposal focuses on increasing quantitative protein labeling rates by over 1000-fold by genetically encoding tetrazine-containing non-canonical amino acids (Tet-ncAAs) into proteins. The second aim seeks to develop labels that react with tetrazine-containing proteins by optimizing label bioavailability and specificity to achieve ultralow background. The third aim leverages the advantages of the site-specific ideal labeling systems to develop a new class of protein labels that ?turn-on? when they bind to DNA, allowing one to monitor DNA-Protein interactions. The fourth aim tackles three key questions surrounding the localization, dynamics and DNA binding ability of the transcription factor STAT3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3) by combining the ideal protein labeling system with confocal microscopy and single molecule tracking.  In addition to developing general fluorescent labels, this research will open access to labeling modalities by engineering protein labels that are fluorogenic upon binding DNA and can be used to report the function of DNA binding proteins. The results of these experiments will fill important gaps in existing knowledge that cannot be adequately addressed using current fluorescent labeling methods.

The latter is fundamentally different from traditional states of matter, such as solids, liquids, and gases. In active matter systems, the individual particles consume energy, propelling them along directional motions, where the mutual interactions of these motorized particles lead to a wide variety of far-from-equilibrium phases with exotic behaviors. The cell is by far the most important example of active matter, where chemistry and mechanics are strongly coupled, for example, allowing the cell to crawl around and actively sense the extracellular environment. Prof. Papoian?s group has been developing a novel research platform, called MEDYAN, which enables computer simulations of complex active matter systems. Prof. Papoian?s laboratory will work on a new representation of cytoskeletal filaments within MEDYAN, anticipating great increase in the sophistication of modeling of various nonlinear deformations of cytoskeletal networks. His group will develop algorithms that take into account chemistry dynamics on deformable membranes, which, in turn, will enable simulations of many interesting cellular processes, such as receptor clustering and cellular signaling. Longer-term, the development of MEDYAN will pave the way for in silico modeling of the whole cell at a single molecule resolution. The PI is also continuing his various educational and outreach activities, in particular, serving as physical chemistry lecturer for the US National Chemistry Olympiad Team of high school students.<br/><br/>Prof. Papoian?s approach is based on a novel simulation framework developed in his group, called MEDYAN (the Mechanochemical Dynamics of Active Networks). It is a highly intricate reactive force field, targeted at micrometer scale complex molecular systems, such as deformable vesicles containing a mixture of various chemical species and polymers. MEDYAN interleaves chemical dynamics with mechanical equilibration, comprehensively covering in particular many important components of the cellular cytoskeleton. Prof. Papoian?s group will rely on a sophisticated nonlinear elasticity theory to describe cytoskeletal filaments in MEDYAN, enabling, for the first-time, structure-based studies of torsional and chiral effects in large cytoskeletal networks. In particular, Prof. Papoian?s laboratory will investigate how the chirality of actin filaments at the nanometer scale may propagate to the micrometer scale, which may lead to rotational symmetry breaking. In a different project, they are developing algorithms for simulating reaction-diffusion processes on the membrane manifold, achieving a careful distinction between surface and interior chemistries. This capability enables studies of a wide variety of exciting biological phenomena, from the aggregation of curvature inducing proteins causing formation of tubular protrusions to signaling receptor clustering in immune cells. MEDYAN has been fruitfully used by many research groups to model a variety of active matter phenomena, from soft matter to cell biology.

This project aims at producing precipitation records from stalagmites located in the Yucatan Peninsula (Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico regions), and at examining underlying causal mechanisms of tropical hydroclimate change by integration of these records with climate model simulations. The researchers will analyze multiple tracers including Oxygen and Carbon isotopes and trace elements to reconstruct precipitation variability in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico regions during key climate periods: the Holocene, the last glacial and during marine isotope stages 8-9. In addition, they will expand an environmental and geochemical monitoring system of surface and cave conditions that started in the year 2014, to investigate the relationship between local precipitation amount, and the Oxygen isotopes of precipitation and stalagmite isotopic and elemental composition. The new monitoring system will include fieldwork to understand the role of vegetation shifts and prior calcite precipitation on the carbon isotopic composition of stalagmites. The monitoring, in conjunction, with the new stalagmite paleoclimate records from the Yucatan Peninsula would help test various hypotheses concerning the environmental controls of the stable isotopic and elemental composition of stalagmites, the role of drought in the development of the Maya civilization, and potential links between Heinrich events (cold intervals) and precipitation declines in the northern Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico region. <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include a characterization and better understanding of hydroclimate variability and tropical cyclones beyond the instrumental record in a densely and vulnerable geographic area (Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico).

The award to Clark Atlanta University has potential to broaden impacts in several areas. The proposed study intends to develop and characterize new crystalline porous materials that are important in solid state chemistry. The research will provide a multidisciplinary platform for undergraduate students to explore cutting-edge materials science and collaborate with researchers at national laboratories. <br/><br/>The proposed work intends to develop next-generation covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that obviate the common reliance upon traditional dynamic linkages such as boron and nitrogen-based linkages. COFs are 2D and 3D crystalline porous materials entirely composed of lightweight organic elements. Due to their unique structural features such as high crystallinity, ultralow density, large surface areas, versatile synthesis, and predesignable structures, COFs have been at the forefront of porous material chemistry in the past decade and garnered enormous attention in widespread areas. However, the inherent chemical instability and inadequate structural complexity are hindering the fullest exploration of COFs. To this end, the work aims to develop the next-generation COFs beyond traditional dynamic linkages by using reactions with limited reversibility, i.e., nucleophilic aromatic substitution and aldol condensation. A series of as-yet-undiscovered aryl ether-linked COFs and unsubstituted sp2 carbon-conjugated COFs will be produced via conventional solvothermal and mechanochemical synthesis. Besides experimental synthesis, the work will unveil the underlying mechanism of new COF formation through multipronged approaches, including exchange reactions in model analogs, computational simulation, and kinetic studies coupled with in situ characterizations. Lastly, the research will advance the use of next-generation COFs in heterogeneous catalysis and elucidate hitherto poorly understood structure-catalysis correlations, which will guide the synthesis and enhancement of COFs for catalysis and beyond. This project challenges the convention of COF chemistry and will produce a series of robust well-ordered porous materials with peculiar properties, thus opening numerous possibilities in widespread applications even in harsh operating environments, which are off-limits of current COF systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of algebraic geometry stems from Descartes? introduction of the coordinate plane to better understand the geometry of objects defined by polynomial equations. For example, the polynomial equation y=x^2 defines a parabola in the coordinate plane and the polynomial equation x^2+y^2=1 defines a circle. In contrast, the graph of the equation y^2 = x^3 has a sharp point, a type of singularity. Geometric objects defined by polynomial equations may admit singularities. The local study of these singularities is a necessity to understanding the geometry of the object. The main research goals of this project concern itself with the study of singularities when the defining equations have coefficients in a positive characteristic numbering system.  <br/> <br/>Singularities of prime characteristic rings are studied, classified, and understood through descriptive behavior of the Frobenius endomorphism. This project focuses on the study of F-pure and F-regular singularities, numerical invariants designed to relate rings among these singularity classes, and test ideals. A particular emphasis is to determine sufficient conditions that imply equality of the finitistic and big test ideal of a local F-pure ring. The purpose of doing so is to investigate the weak-implies-strong conjecture from tight closure theory, to establish unifying behavior of F-regular rings, and to relate the numerical invariant F-signature with the behavior of valuation rings centered over an F-regular ring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies report that most African American youth will experience racism during their lifetimes, and these experiences increase their risk for negative life outcomes, such as poor mental and physical health and less academic success. How do African American youth manage their experiences with racism to protect against such negative outcomes? This research examines how African American youth develop a specific form of emotional competence, called emotion regulatory flexibility, to protect themselves from racism. They may attend to cues that signal when an interaction is not going well, and then use these signals to adjust how they express and manage their emotions so that others do not perceive them as angry or threatening. This research provides a novel perspective on emotion regulatory flexibility as a form of emotion-related competence that is malleable and culturally situated. <br/><br/>How do African American youth develop such self-protective emotional competence? This question is addressed by doing research with both African American youth and their parents, and by combining physiological and self-report measures. The unique approach provides subjective and objective indicators of emotional reactions to racism and captures the social cues that African American youth use to manage these situations. The research also includes parent-child interactions to reveal how parents discuss these issues with their children. This project provides training experiences for junior scientists from various racial backgrounds in how to work with the African American community to address the effect of racism on youth, and can help African American youth recognize their positive emotion skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, vulnerabilities of IoT wireless communication networks will be investigated by designing optimal attacking strategies based on adversarial multi-armed bandits, and randomized time-varying feedback graphs. In the defense design paradigm, an intelligent IoT device will apply novel adversarial multi-armed bandit methods for effective frequency channel selection and data transmission while minimizing channel switching delay. In addition, both objectives of channel and power allocation will be integrated into a unified framework to optimize the IoT user's power consumption. Characterizing the wireless channels' inherent conditions with a time-varying stochastic process and considering both the attacker and the IoT user to be learning-based, the two agents form an online repeated stochastic game. It is intended to identify any possible equilibrium between these two agents using stochastic optimization methods. Furthermore, using a data-driven methodology based on statistical factor analysis approaches, the IoT device's robustness will be characterized as a function of its intelligence factors. Then, the proposed defense frameworks will be extended to centralized and decentralized multi-user IoT networks where combinatorial online learning approaches and various collision resolutions techniques will be utilized in the centralized and decentralized settings, respectively. Eventually, the collective intelligence of multiple IoT users will be quantitatively evaluated by extracting the group intelligence and examining its impact on the IoT users? resiliency and network capacity in adversarial settings. Successful implementation of the proposed optimal spectrum access policy based on multidisciplinary techniques will provide secure spectrum sharing mechanisms for the IoT users with practical considerations which enables them to circumvent the adversary and maximize the network capacity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, experts in the operation of chemical plants make decisions based on years of experience, but their decision strategies often are not well documented and, due to the complexity of these manufacturing processes, are difficult to explain even to fellow operators. This means the complete transfer of expert knowledge to new operators remains an unsolved problem. Likewise in microbiology, cells can be considered autonomous agents that make decisions regarding gene expression and cell metabolic function. While we can observe the decisions cells make in experiments, we often do not understand the motivation for these choices. Answering this question would provide fundamental insights that could advance cancer treatment, immunology research, and biomanufacturing operations. These challenges provide the motivation for this research program which aims to develop a computational framework that uses observations of decisions to uncover the underlying decision-making processes. Our research will advance the theory and algorithmic representation of this fundamental problem. Through our integrated research and education activities, we will teach future scientists and engineers to use advanced decision-making tools and promote interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers that work in the field of decision science.<br/><br/>Our proposed approach is inspired by the principle of optimality, which conjectures that autonomous agents generally make decisions in some optimal fashion. Following this principle, we propose to model decision-making processes as mathematical optimization problems in which decisions are considered optimal solutions. Given a set of observations, each represented by the decisions made in a specific situation, the goal is to infer the optimization model whose solution results in the observed decisions; this is referred to as Inverse Optimization (IO). The IO approach enjoys all the modeling flexibility provided by mathematical optimization, facilitates incorporation of domain knowledge, and allows the generation of inherently interpretable decision-making models. In this research, we will develop computationally efficient IO algorithms and apply them to a range of problems in science and engineering. Three specific Aims are proposed: (1) learning unknown objective functions, (2) learning unknown constraints, and (3) optimization with IO-based models. Aims 1 and 2 focus on the development of computational methods addressing the challenging aspects of IO, such as nonlinearity, discrete decisions, model selection, and adaptive sampling. Mixed-integer programming, bilevel optimization, and decomposition will be applied in innovative ways to ensure computational tractability. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate how optimization models derived from IO can not only help discover hidden decision-making processes but also serve as surrogate optimizers and embedded models in hierarchical optimization, with specific applications in bioprocess optimization and environmental policy design. Because the principle of optimality enjoys broad (albeit often approximate) validity and the IO methods developed in our research will be generalizable, our work has the potential to broadly impact artificial intelligence research, robotics, biology, healthcare, and even management and behavioral science. We will pursue a set of activities that include teaching K-12 students the basic concepts of decision science through games, incorporating optimization into our chemical engineering curriculum, establishing a short course on decision making, and organizing cross-disciplinary workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conjecture is important both because Calabi-Yau manifolds appear in many diverse parts of mathematics, but also because the mirror aspect unites two branches of mathematics (symplectic and complex geometry, which measure the two different aspects) in ways not previously anticipated.  Perhaps the most fundamental question is how, given one such object, one obtains its mirror partner.

These forests are also a vital part of global recycling of freshwater, and their loss has implications for food security for millions of people as well as global climate dynamics. Climate change is threatening these systems and there are concerns that as temperatures rise and rainfall becomes less reliable, these forests might be replaced by low-diversity grasslands. However, it is unclear what level of climate change might trigger a forest-to-grassland transition.  Paleoecology can provide information about biological diversity in the past, and how biodiversity patterns changed during past warming events. This research project will investigate two periods of climate warming, one that lasted from about 8000 to 5000 years ago, and another even warmer time that lasted from 128,000 to 120,000 years ago. Ancient lakes build up sediments through time, and by taking a drill-core down through the sediment the history of the region can be captured in the lake mud. The researchers will analyze the fossil and chemical content of lake sediment cores from seven locations in the Amazon and Andes to establish how much the climate changed in the past, and whether those changes were enough to induce a shift from forest to grassland. By looking at a range of locations that vary in moisture, from very wet to quite dry, and degree of warming, the researchers will estimate how close the modern rainforest is to a forest-to-grassland transition. Additionally, new interactions between the collaborating research groups will include a co-taught paleoecology/paleoclimatology course, a sponsored category in a local film festival, and training of at least 10 undergraduates, two doctoral students, and one postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>The research will address a number of hypotheses relating to climate-vegetation responses such as flickering, teleconnections, ecosystem buffering, and tipping points. By using organic geochemical data to estimate paleotemperature, leaf wax isotopes to estimate precipitation, sediment chemistry to characterize droughts, fossil pollen to reconstruct vegetation, and charcoal to reconstruct fire frequency, the researchers will investigate ecosystem change under conditions as much as 2 degrees C (4 degrees F) warmer than the present. The Last Interglacial will provide an index of scale of change in traits, fire prevalence and community composition in a climate 1-2 degrees C warmer than modern. In the directly-dated Holocene, the data will assess sub-decadal variance in ecosystem indicators, and allow rates of change to be investigated. Currently, no high-resolution records of Amazonian temperature exist, so the novel approach of separating climatic change from that of ecological proxies will be transformational for quantitative neotropical paleoecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The addition of electrons to chemical systems can make the unexpected occur, enticing seemingly impossible processes to take place. For example, electrons drive, direct, induce, and initiate an astonishing variety of transformations, including DNA damage, proton transfer, molecular activation, and a vast array of electrochemical reactions. The negative ions that result from electron attachment are also crucial actors in chemical reaction mechanisms, playing key roles in organic chemistry, electrochemistry, and radiation biology. Electron-influenced processes in complex environments are ubiquitous. For these reasons, a microscopic understanding of basic phenomena involving excess electrons is essential. To probe these phenomena, Dr. Bowen and his group use a technique called negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy to measure how tightly electrons are bound to negatively charged atoms, molecules, and clusters. The experiments reveal detailed information about both the ions and their neutral counterparts, while also providing important benchmarks for computational chemistry. Considering the wide-ranging importance of electron-driven processes, the work in Dr. Bowen?s lab has interdisciplinary appeal, with impact ranging across fields as diverse as atmospheric chemistry, catalysis, radiation chemistry and biology, astrochemistry, and mass spectrometry. Dr. Bowen?s work also makes strong contributions to education and human resource development by mentoring graduate students who will become the scientists of tomorrow, by providing undergraduates from Johns Hopkins and other colleges and universities an opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research, and by giving high school, middle school, and elementary school students a glimpse into scientific research. The outreach efforts encourage participation from groups that are underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>Dr. Bowen?s research examines electron-induced proton transfer (EIPT) reactions, weakly-bound (diffuse) excess electron states of atoms and molecules, and the properties of transient molecular anions. For example, the research team is exploring the role of EIPT in cluster anions, where they expect the internal interactions to be governed by the excess electron. EIPT is a wide-spread, perhaps even ubiquitous electron-assisted process. The team is also examining the relationship between EIPT in ground-state molecular anions and the process of excited-state intra-molecular proton transfer (ESIPT) in neutral molecules. Dr. Bowen?s research on weakly-bound (diffuse) excess electron states examines some of the most subtle interactions in chemistry; those between electrons and atoms or molecules. In this area, the research team is studying the formation and characterization of polarizability-bound electrons in xenon atomic cluster anions and in ground state anions of buckminsterfullerene; quadrupole-bound electrons in electronically metastable atomic metal anions; and multiple Rydberg electrons in metal-ammonia cluster anions. Although the electrons are weakly bound in each of these cases, they represent steps on a staircase of progressively stronger interactions. Finally, the research team is studying transient molecular anions using a unique approach, developed by Dr. Bowen, that combines Rydberg electron transfer with anion photoelectron spectroscopy (RET-aPES). The research team uses the RET-aPES technique to form and characterize valence anions of nucleobase molecules, the Criegee intermediate, and the hydrogen iodide molecule. They are also using RET-aPES to explore the barely studied, yet fundamentally important process of Penning electron detachment. These studies foster a deeper understanding of the earliest stages of electron damage to DNA, the electrophilic properties of important atmospheric intermediates, the unexpected stability of HI anion, and collisional anion destruction processes in energetic gaseous environments, such as flames and solar atmospheres. The outcomes from this broad research project are expected to have widespread impact across many fields of science. Additionally, the project provides advanced training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate research students, while also engaging K-12 students through Dr. Bowen's outreach activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research advances the fundamental understanding of catalysis and the ways that enzymes make use of networks of protein motions in order to achieve high efficiency and selectivity. Such understanding has the potential to support the development of new catalysts for targeted chemical reactivity, as well as the design and optimization of biocatalysts for applications in bioreactors. In addition, Prof. Cheatum and his group are working to extend the capabilities of the laser spectroscopy technique to make it more widely applicable for solving chemical and biochemical problems of broad scientific interest. The students engaged in this research develop skills in molecular biology, computational chemistry, and laser spectroscopy that are important for applications across science and technology, thus preparing them to make critical impacts in the scientific workforce. Professor Cheatum is also engaged in high-impact outreach activities involving K-12 students, and partners with faculty at a local community college in order to involve their students in his research and to encourage those students to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers.<br/><br/>This project addresses fundamental questions about the role of the long-range protein superstructure in enzyme catalyzed reactions: How does the peripheral molecular structure around a catalytic center affect its selectivity and efficiency? How far away from the catalytic center can this influence extend? How can one identify the key residues that modulate the catalyzed reaction dynamics? The central hypothesis of this work is that long-range networks in enzymes dynamically regulate catalysis. Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing protein conformational distributions and dynamics, and is the primary tool the team is using to probe the dynamic effects of remote protein residues. The team is working to determine the effects of remote residues on the dynamics of the catalytic center in dihydrofolate reductase, to understand the effects of remote residues involved in the rate-promoting vibration in purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and to identify remote residues that are involved in the active-site structure and reaction dynamics in formate dehydrogenase. Understanding how long-range interactions affect enzyme reactivity has broad impact across many disciplines. Additional broader impacts of the project include the advanced technical training of graduate, undergraduate, and community college students, as well as Prof. Cheatum?s involvement in Skype a Scientist and Data Nuggets programs to share his research with K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. This project brings together eight undergraduate students with faculty for an eight-week intensive research and learning experience to study the science and technology of environmental conservation. America?s biodiversity hotspots exist within a matrix of urban sprawl, reserves, and working lands. In populated areas, such as California, biodiversity cannot be supported solely through the designation of wildland and conservation areas. There is a need for a broader approach that incorporates humans, their activities, and working lands. This understanding has given rise to reconciliation ecology movements and new science that seek to integrate humanized spaces?working lands such as ranches and farms?with existing systems of wildlands and conservation areas. These approaches expand the habitat for rare plant and animal species as well as sustainably manage and provide ecosystem services to society. The objective of this REU is to train the next generation of land managers and restoration scientists in conservation science and technology to facilitate the transition of working lands to de facto working reserves. We will train a highly diverse group of students in the field on River Ridge Ranch (RRR), a working ranchland near Sequoia National Park, and in the laboratory, in the use of innovative geospatial technologies and systems and the application of the associated STEM biogeographic concepts that inform them. Students will develop their own research questions and carry out original research in teams. They will also receive training in career skills, including professional report writing and oral communication for in-person and virtual visual presentations. <br/><br/>The current intersection of population growth, climate change, and resource demand have created a pressing need for re-evaluating land use, especially working landscapes that have high ecological service value. This project will develop a framework for tracking metrics for a triple bottom line of ecosystem services?agricultural production, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and soil health. We will introduce and train students in the conceptual questions framed by this intersection, the choices faced by society and land managers, and the analytical and technological approaches needed to evaluate alternative solutions. We will train teams of students to track changes over time in carbon sequestration, vegetation cover, animal diversity, and other factors. We will use this team-based approach to study how plant communities respond to different disturbance regimes, such as the release of lands from intensive cattle grazing, reimplementation of fire regimes once used by Native Americans, and other forces that cause transitions between different vegetation states (e.g., grasslands to savannas to woodlands) with subsequent changes in ecosystem services. We will introduce a diverse group of students to the use of conservation drones (UAVs) to gather high species specificity data on vegetation. Data will be analyzed using state-of-the-art software systems to provide research teams and land managers with accurate data to inform management decisions that support economic and environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the field of coding theory studies how to cleverly encode a message so that the underlying information can still be recovered even after the message has been subjected to some kind of corruption by noise. While coding theory has been hugely successful and influential, there are many real-world settings in which a noise process affects information ""in the wild"" where coding schemes cannot be applied.  For example, given a DNA sequence that is subject to mutations or deletions, there is no opportunity to encode the sequence using tools of coding theory because it occurs in nature in a way that is not under human control.  So, there is a need for techniques that can reconstruct information that has *not* been cleverly encoded, and yet has been corrupted with different types of noise.  One particularly challenging type of noise is ""deletion noise"", meaning that some of the characters of the message are deleted with no indication being given as to where the deletions took place.  Fortunately, in many scenarios of this sort it is natural to assume that multiple independent copies of the deletion-plagued data are available; for example, in a biological setting one might have many copies of a given DNA sequence where deletions have affected each copy in a different way.  This project will study algorithms for performing reconstruction in scenarios such as the above.  Another important goal of this project will be dissemination and outreach activities. Planned activities include new advanced courses on reconstruction problems, training graduate students and postdocs through research collaboration, disseminating research results through seminar talks, survey articles and other publications, and continuing ongoing outreach activities aimed at increasing interest in and awareness of theoretical computer science in a broader population.<br/><br/>In more detail, the research team will build on their preliminary results to develop new algorithms for the trace-reconstruction problem, where independent copies of data corrupted by deletions (such a deletion-corrupted data string is known as a ""trace"") are available and the challenge is to reconstruct the original uncorrupted data. They will analyze a number of different natural variants of this problem, which are obtained by making different assumptions about the nature of the deletion process (low, intermediate, or high deletion rates, correlated versus uncorrelated deletions, and so on); the type of data that is being transmitted (worst-case data, average-case data, etc); and the desiderata for successful reconstruction (perfect reconstruction versus different notions of approximate reconstruction).  The research team will also investigate new algorithmic problems related to deletion noise, including more challenging versions of the problem described above in which the reconstruction algorithm is given a mixture of traces from multiple different source strings and the goal is to reconstruct the entire underlying ""population"" of source strings rather than just a single source string.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Anderson and his group at the University of Wyoming are using extremely cold crystals made from molecular hydrogen as a reaction vessel to investigate chemistry at low temperatures. The first thrust of the research project examines the diffusion and reactivity of hydrogen atoms.  At extremely low temperatures (-457°F), hydrogen atoms are better described as matter waves instead of particles, which has a major impact on how they diffuse through the crystal and react chemically with other species.  Chemistry is transformed under these low-temperature conditions into the fully quantum mechanical regime where unexpected chemical behavior can be discovered.  The second thrust of the work involves experimental studies of nuclear spin states in polyatomic molecules that undergo rapid cooling, photochemistry, or chemical reactions. Nuclear spin refers to the internal state of an atom, and sometimes has an orientation.  Certain molecules, like water, come in two different forms, one where the two hydrogen atoms have their nuclear spins aligned in the same direction, and the other with the two hydrogen atom spins aligned in opposite directions.  These different nuclear spin isomers of water have different magnetic properties.  The research team led by Professor Anderson is examining to what extent nuclear spin is conserved during various physical and chemical processes, with the goal of learning how to use nuclear spin to control chemical reactions and to enhance magnetic imaging techniques.  <br/><br/>This experimental work uses a custom-designed cryogenic apparatus to synthesize cryocrystals of para-hydrogen (a specific nuclear spin isomer of molecular hydrogen) doped with parts per million concentrations of chemical impurities at temperatures in the 1.5 to 5 K range.  Hydrogen atoms are created in situ using a variety of ultraviolet light sources and the ensuing reaction kinetics are measured using high-resolution Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.  Professor Anderson and his group utilize a liquid helium cryostat to achieve such low temperatures and have built a dedicated helium recovery system to recycle the spent helium gas to minimize supply costs.  The students working with Professor Anderson gain experience using sophisticated methods in experimental physical chemistry that probe the physical and chemical properties of quantum materials, materials whose properties are dominated by the laws of quantum mechanics. The involvement of students in the research has a significant impact by training future scientists in the techniques of low-temperature chemistry and the quantum-mechanical manipulation of matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Communities that have migrated or been displaced face many challenges, among them food insecurity, limited economic opportunities, and a loss of identity. This project focuses on herding communities to understand how particular economic and social strategies can differentially influence the outcome and experience of migrants. Agropastoralists benefit from a mobile food base that enables them to move between different environments and maintain broad social networks. Often considered marginal to urbanized state societies, herders find themselves at an advantage when the pressures of political conflict and persistent drought force communities to migrate in search of resources.

When two monolayers of atomically thin materials, also knowns as two-dimensional (2D) materials, are stacked together with a well-controlled twist angle between these two layers, they form a new periodic structure with interesting properties. In this collaborative project, the PIs investigate these 2D materials to gain knowledge that could enable transformative technology innovations such as high-temperature superconductivity, quantum electronics and optoelectronics. This project integrates an education component to train students and build a strong workforce for quantum science and technologies. Under-represented groups are particularly encouraged and included in the education programs.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>Correlated states such as Mott insulators and Wigner crystals remain intriguing subjects of physics. More recently, twisted hetero-bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a new platform with even more enhanced correlation strength, and their strong spin-orbit coupling and presence of bandgaps provide new avenues to explore spin-related physics and optoelectronics in correlated states. In this collaborative proposal, the PIs explore the moiré superlattices formed by twisted hetero-bilayer TMDs. The research plan includes two main thrusts. Thrust I is to characterize the interaction strength of the correlated states and study its relationship with moiré structure parameters and external controls to manipulate the correlated states. Thrust II is to explore new correlated states arising from interactions with other electronic phases, such as the interplay of correlated states with Landau levels, the effect of strong correlation on valley physics and excitonic physics of the moiré superlattice, and other types of new states that could possibly arise in this strongly interacting system. The collaborative project trains graduate and undergraduate students are trained for future placement in quantum science and technologies.

Recent measurements provide compelling evidence for a mixed composition of cosmic nuclei over the complete energy range over which such measurements are available today. Disentangling this mixture by a better classification of the primary particles will enable us to search for their origin in various ways: proton-enhanced cosmic-ray astronomy, correlations of mass-dependent anisotropies with source candidates, and the selection of neutrino and photon candidates for pointed astronomy.

Characterizing and controlling matter driven far from equilibrium by lasers represents a key challenge for science and technology.  This is because matter can behave very differently when shaken by the intense coherent light provided by lasers. Further, lasers offer the possibility of manipulation on an ultrafast timescale (on the order of a millionth of one billionth of a second), something that is simply not achievable by more conventional means such as an applied voltage, chemical or thermodynamic control. The Franco group will develop general schemes for the laser control of electrons in matter and, in doing so, catalyze the development of a novel class of laser-dressed dynamical materials with ?on-demand"" effective properties that are tunable on an ultrafast timescale. Recent proposals by the group include the use of light to drive ultrafast electronic currents, turn insulators into conductors, and optically transparent materials into broadband absorbers. In addition to the fundamental interest in being able to manipulate electron dynamics with lasers, this ability also serves as the basis for the development of ultrafast electronics, switching, imaging, catalysis, and, in fact, any science and technology at large based on electrons and their control. The outreach activities of this proposal include the organization of annual conferences exploring quantum frontiers in molecular science, integrating research with education by developing a graduate course on ?Quantum Dynamics?, and advancing initiatives to increase diversity in STEM at the University of Rochester. <br/><br/>Specifically, the Franco group will investigate the fundamental limits in the quantum control of electrons and advance our capabilities to use high and intermediate intensity ultrafast laser pulses to manipulate electronic properties and dynamics in molecules, nanostructures and extended systems. The group is particularly interested in effects that are triggered by the Stark effect induced by strong non-resonant laser fields. These fields effectively modify the energy levels in a dynamic and reversible fashion thus creating laser-dressed materials with transient properties that can be very different from those observed near thermodynamic equilibrium. The general objective is to understand the ability of laser-dressed matter to absorb light, transport charge, and the use of light to control electron dynamics. For this, the group will develop Floquet-based theories of the optical absorption properties of matter, the theory and simulation of laser-driven currents in nanoscale junctions, and advance the use of Stark based strategies to control electron dynamics at material interfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More specifically, they seek to improve the efficiency of methods based upon transition state theory so that dynamics over experimental time scales can be modeled using forces and energy from density functional theory (DFT).  In order to mitigate the computational expense of DFT a number of strategies will be followed to make the calculations as efficient as possible.  First, a public kinetic database will be established with geometric information of reaction mechanisms, which can be used to propose transition states from a query structure to the database. Second, machine learning (ML) methods will be used to accelerate our calculations.  Instead of fitting global potential energy surfaces, ML methods will be used to fit local energies, forces, and curvature to accelerate DFT calculations rather than replace them.  Specifically, the ML models will: (1) provide a pre-conditioner for the optimization of minima and saddle points; (2) suggest local minima to facilitate the search for stable materials; (3) efficiently construct a hyperdynamics bias potential for modeling of rare events in energy materials directly with DFT.  As well as using ML methods, this project will investigate how the choice of ML method, including neural networks and Gaussian processes, as well as the numerous hyperparameters, determine the shape and quality of the potential energy surface.  Finally, methodology to take trajectories of catalytic reactions will be developed to build reaction networks, from which the overall activity of a catalyst or battery material can be understood.

Reactive magnesium oxide cement (RMC) is one of the most promising and environmentally friendly alternatives to ordinary Portland cement as a modern concrete binder. The advantages of RMC include low-cost and low carbon footprint compared to conventional cements. RMC achieves its strength by forming different magnesium carbonate phases as binding agents by reacting with carbon dioxide and water. However, the strength and durability properties of existing RMCs exhibit significant variations, slowing their adoption by construction industry. This research will address the following two technical challenges: (i) understanding the fundamental processes that govern the formation of dense magnesium carbonate phases using novel experimental testing and computer simulation; and (ii) innovation of durable RMC-based composites with high strength by incorporating corrosion-resistant micro- and macro-fibers. In this project, an outreach program for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students will be implemented in order to disseminate knowledge on low-carbon structural materials for the construction industry, and train next generation students and engineers with sustainable infrastructure engineering backgrounds. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this research is to tailor the carbonation products of reactive magnesium oxide cement by maneuvering thermodynamic and kinetic precipitation pathways in order to achieve high-performance RMC-based composites. RMC can be produced from low-temperature (500-1000 °C) calcination of either magnesite deposits or brucite precipitates from reject brine. Thus, it is deemed a more sustainable binder to ordinary Portland cement, whose production accounts for 7% of the global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Yet, the large specific volume variability of the different reaction products of RMC and the vulnerability of the embedded rebars to corrosion due to an absence or quick loss of the passivating oxide layer hindered its widespread application in the construction practice. To address these longstanding challenges, this research offers a combined experimental and computational research plan with two objectives: (i) to guide the nucleation and growth pathways via nanoscale interfacial energy considerations with non-reactive seeds (quartz, calcite, magnesite, and dolomite) to avoid the precipitation of low-density hydrated magnesium carbonate phases and hence reducing the volume change by modulating the competition between thermodynamics and kinetics driving forces, and (ii) to employ this fundamental knowledge to develop dense RMC-based fiber-reinforced structural composites that are less permeable and more resistant to cracking and corrosion. This approach exploits the fundamentals of the nucleation and growth process at the nanoscale, rather than case-by-case testing of different mix designs and processing conditions, to achieve robust composite performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop the algorithmic solutions needed to exploit this seismic shift in storage technology.<br/><br/>The team considers three impacts on algorithm performance that arise from new hardware technology such as nonvolatile memories and increased parallelism: (1) there are smaller gaps between levels in latency and in bandwidth, (2) many-core technologies introduce sharing effects on caches, and (3) memory hierarchies do not adhere to a standard strictly nested model.  The team is investigating: (a) algorithmic problems in parallel-cache allocation and high-bandwidth-memory scheduling and allocation; (b) data structural problems that arise from different I/O cost models, including those that factor in the computational cost and/or the cost of durability; (c) extensions to the streaming and semi-streaming models, where algorithms have some amount of sequentially accessible working memory in addition to the traditional small pool of randomly accessible memory; (d) new I/O-efficient algorithms for directed graphs.  The team is continuing community-building efforts to span systems and algorithms, including founding, steering, and/or running two new conferences and organizing workshops on the theory of non-volatile memory and storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biomass has significant potential as a renewable source of energy. For example, it has been estimated that by 2030, 20% of transportation fuel and 25% of chemicals will be produced from biomass. Despite an annual production of around 170 billion metric tons, no more than 5% of this produced biomass is used for diverse purposes. The potential market for value-added chemicals and high-quality fuel products produced from plant materials is immense.  However, at present it is more cost-effective to drill and refine mineral diesel oil than grow, extract, and purify biodiesel. Environmentally friendly solvents known as ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have the potential to serve as a significant part of the solution in the creation of economically viable biofuels. Dr. Acevedo will develop and apply artificial intelligence-based software (i.e., machine learning) to design new ILs and DESs that efficiently convert biomass-derived building blocks into liquid fuel and extract impurities from diesel and biodiesel fuels. This project will help accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to biomass-derived energy by emphasizing the use of cost-effective and recyclable ionic fluids. The computational tools developed by Dr. Acevedo will be freely available to the scientific community. In addition, multiple community outreach events will highlight the use of artificial intelligence in chemistry through demonstrations at science museums located in Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, Florida, research networking social gatherings, and an illustrated science poem contest for K-12 grades.<br/><br/>In the first major research thrust, Dr. Acevedo will study the conversion of the highly versatile biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) compound into (a) 5,5?-di(hydroxymethyl)furoin (DHMF) using N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, and (b) 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) via a Cannizzaro reaction. Both methods are efficient, mild, and eco-friendly. To predict solvent-derived rate and selectivity enhancements upon these HMF transformations, a new mixed machine learning, quantum mechanics, and molecular mechanics (ML/QM/MM) methodology will be developed here that provides the accuracy of ab initio QM calculations with dramatically increased calculation speeds. In the second major research thrust, Dr. Acevedo will explore the use of ILs and DESs to extract (a) dibenzothiophene and other aromatic sulfur-compounds from diesel, and (b) glycerol from biodiesel, a waste product developed during the transesterification of plant triglyceride oil to biofuel. Both ILs and DESs have properties ideally suited for impurity extraction from transportation fuel: insoluble in oil, non-toxic, and environmentally benign. To study the origin of the favorable intermolecular interactions between these fuel-based impurities and ILs/DESs, our alternative method will train artificial neural networks (ANNs) using representative ab initio molecular dynamics data and couple the newly optimized ANN potentials to Monte Carlo simulations. Machine learning based methodology developed will be broadly applicable to other areas of chemical research and all software/products generated as part of this project will be readily available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SDMs are built by correlating observations of a species (e.g., whether it is present or absent) with environmental features. Once built, they can be used to predict how likely a species is to occur at a new site or interpreted to understand why species live where they do. The spatial aspects of species and environmental data present challenges for the machine learning methods often used to build SDMs, and this award focuses on two of those challenges. First, one must assess the quality of an SDM in order to determine the validity of its predictions and interpretation. To assess quality, some data are often held out from model building. Then, the model?s ability to predict the unseen data are used as a measure of its quality. With spatial data however, randomly selecting data to hold out can lead to optimistic bias in quality estimates. This award will support research into methods for assessing model quality that account for spatial characteristics of the data in order to produce unbiased estimates of model quality. A second challenge arises when the data supplied to an SDM come from the growing repositories collected by community science programs. Under-reporting is a common phenomenon in biodiversity surveys (since one typically cannot observe all individuals of all species during an observation), and community science is no exception. The error introduced by under-reporting can be corrected by conducting multiple observations at the same site and estimating the probability of detecting the species, but community science programs are often not structured this way. This award will support research to create groups of multiple observations after the fact, so that under-reporting error can be accounted for better in this growing data resource. In addition to these scientific aims, this award will support education and outreach to graduate, undergraduate, and pre-college students, including the production of a set of benchmark datasets, a new introductory computer science course, and modules for STEM clubs and camps.<br/> <br/>The research contributions of this award will enable scientists to build better models of spatial phenomena. The anticipated framework for cross-validation that accounts for domain adaptation between training and test folds will produce better generalization performance estimates by accounting for spatial autocorrelation and admitting target testing distributions. In SDM, this means that researchers will be able to correct for bias induced by autocorrelation and provide climate model projections to obtain estimates of how species will fare under global change. In addition, it will define and propose solutions to a new type of spatial clustering problem: creating spatial modeling abstractions aimed at meeting the assumptions of a subsequent modeling phase. In science and management questions informed by SDMs, this will improve the ability to correct for observational errors and translate to better habitat models. The methods will be applicable beyond the motivating applications in SDM to a variety of spatial domains. The education plan will build bridges between ecology and computer science, while drawing on best educational practices to improve recruitment and retention of underserved students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But many ordinary soaps and detergent negate this proverbial expression by allowing the two substances to mix.  Called surfactants, these soft and fragile materials interact with water (or oil) in complex, subtle, and nuanced manners. Their dissolution in water is often accompanied by the formation of unusual structures that extend far beyond the sizes of molecules producing a dynamic mosaic that characterize the surfactant-laden aqueous phase.  One such example is the formation of a class of finger-like cylindrical protrusions called myelin figures, tens of micrometers in diameters and hundreds of micrometers in length, which appear when a dry mass of surfactant meets water. This project involves controlled laboratory experiments to study their formation, direct their growth, and exploit their morphologies to produce novel nanomaterials.   The findings of the project should benefit many areas of applications, including food, cosmetics, soap, and dispersion technologies. The project includes the training and participation of a graduate student and a post-doc in the scientific process. It also engages undergraduate students and underrepresented groups in STEM through the Vertically-Integrated Program, which offers Science & Society credits and opportunities for laboratory research over multiple years on a single, consolidated project.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/><br/>The equilibration of complex fluids is often accompanied by unusual instabilities as they progress toward equilibrium. This is perhaps best exemplified by myelinic instabilities, which emerge when an insoluble surfactant meets water. The individual myelins ¬? cylindrical smectic liquid crystals tens of micrometers in diameter and hundreds of micrometers in length ? grow sinuously, by a two-dimensional reptation-like motion, which tightly juxtapose with their neighbors; elongate, cooperatively;  and, often fold morphologically, into symmetry-breaking helical shapes. This project seeks to understand their formation mechanisms, control their spatial organization, investigate their responsiveness to environmental perturbations, and exploit their nanometer scale confinements to template synthesis of nanostructures. It experimentally tests the hypothesis that the intrinsically non-equilibrium process of amphiphilic hydration can be controllably tuned to lift equilibrium constraints, dial-in structural instabilities, and kinetically trap long-lived metastable states within the free energy landscape that characterizes the hydration process. It also seeks to exploit myelin figures as self-organizing dynamic templates to synthesize nanoscale materials into hierarchical, extended, and complex superlattices. Using a combination of microscopy based quantitative measurements, the planned research activities include(1) develop methods to control the spatial organization of myelin figures (taming the chaos); (2) characterizing phase-separating mixtures of amphiphiles within myelin morphologies (introducing chemical diversity); (3) accessing higher-order, symmetric breaking organization of myelin figures by coupling physical-chemical stress from their local microenvironment (shape-shifting myelins); and (4) templating synthesis of nanomaterials by exploiting myelinic confinement (templated nanosynthesis). The effort should yield new insights into non-equilibrium routes for controlling supramolecular organization and novel approaches for synthesis-with-design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Acoustically levitated objects also influence the sound field, scattering sound waves and redirecting their forces. Scattered waves mediate interactions among the objects that cause them to organize themselves into dynamic three-dimensional assemblies. These wave-matter composite systems constitute a largely unexplored state of matter with extraordinary and potentially useful properties. The program on ?Analyzing and Organizing Soft Matter with Acoustic Holography? is dedicated to developing the fundamental principles and practical techniques needed to control acoustic forces, elucidating the physics of wave-matter composite systems, and advancing a new paradigm for materials characterization based on quantitative analysis of scattered sound. This experimental program is motivated by the Principal Investigator?s recent breakthrough in the theory of wave-matter interactions that explains how to design and project sound waves that move matter. Principles emerging from these studies are both general and fundamental. They have practical applications, moreover, in areas as diverse as non-contact manufacturing and 3D displays. Technology transfer for these applications already is under way, The science of acoustic manipulation through acoustic holography lends itself to effective STEM outreach in the K-12 sector. It also provides a wealth of accessible research projects for undergraduates, thereby helping to build the pipeline for diversity and inclusion in STEM research.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The recently-introduced acoustokinetic framework explains how the amplitude and phase profiles of a sound wave give rise to forces and torques on insonated objects. An analogous approach has proved extraordinarily fruitful for the field of optical micromanipulation by providing design principles for optical holograms that implement desired force landscapes. Translating principles of optical manipulation into experimental realizations has benefitted from highly advanced technology for shaping the wavefronts of light. No such technology currently exists for sound. Realizing the benefits of acoustokinetics therefore requires a novel approach to computational holography. This program bridges this technological gap by introducing spectral holography as a new paradigm for computational holography. Spectral holography is an approach to wavefront sculpting that relies on controlling the wave?s amplitude and phase at a small number of discrete emitters but over a wide range of frequencies. Whereas standard monochromatic holograms create static time-averaged force fields, spectral holograms can have dynamic content over a wide range of time and length scales. The time-dependent behavior of individual objects and many-body systems immersed in such multi-scale landscapes represent an emerging area of research. Anticipated outcomes from studying these systems include advances in the fundamental science of classical wave-matter interactions and discovery of new principles of self-organization in soft-matter and granular materials. The critical role of inertia in sound-mediated self-organization constitutes a particularly promising frontier for fundamental discoveries such as the remarkable dynamical behavior of wave-driven oscillators. This program also provides exciting opportunities for technology transfer to industry, including contact-free materials transport for manufacturing, rapid 3D scanning for volumetric displays and large-scale remote materials characterization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Key tools for these come from local cohomology theory, and the study of integer torsion in local cohomology modules. Other projects involve Hankel determinantal rings, close cousins of the determinantal rings of classical invariant theory. The F-regularity of Hankel determinantal rings of positive prime characteristic will be investigated; this has an entirely equivalent formulation in terms of differential operators.

Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged in the past decade as a promising low-cost, thin film solar cell with high efficiency and roll-to-roll printing processability, which could encourage a transition into a clean energy economy. However, the use of lead raises the concerns for commercialization because of the potential environmental contamination and human health problems. It is important to carefully find an environmentally benign and efficient replacement for lead with a focus on keeping the excellent properties ascribed to its presence in perovskite materials. Tin perovskite is regarded as an ideal candidate to replace lead perovskite with the theoretical PCE of tin PSCs close to 30% according to Shockley-Queisser limit. Despite progress having been made, the efficiency and stability of tin PSCs are still inferior to their lead counterparts. This project will apply a synergetic approach via materials and interface engineering with the goal to reduce defects, suppress tin oxidization, enhance charge extraction and transport, and reduce energy losses, hence, to increase the efficiency and stability of tin PSCs. Success in this project will advance the knowledge of ionic semiconducting materials and device physics of thin film solar cells, which could lead to a transition into a clean energy economy because of potential commercialization of lead-free, highly efficient and stable PSCs fabricated with low-temperature, large-area, high-throughput processes. Graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will receive training in this highly interdisciplinary research project. The knowledge gained from this work will be disseminated through the workshop that the PI group will offer to the annual event of Expanding Your Horizons at Cornell campus and Ithaca Sciencenter by providing hands-on activities and demonstrations for young students and their families. <br/><br/>The challenge with tin-based PSCs is primarily due to tin-defects, resulting in the undesirable nonradiative recombination of photocarriers and metallic conductivity, and the attendant loss of open-circuit voltage. Additionally, the dangling bonds on the surface and at the grain boundaries introduce trap states, which act as the centers of nonradiative recombination and degradation sites. The research team aims to (1) develop novel Dion-Jacobson (DJ) phase two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) tin pseudohalide perovskites to reduce tin defects and passivate defects at the grain boundaries and surfaces; (2) synthesize new hole transport materials by introducing functional groups to guide perovskite growth and reduce interface trap states; and (3) deploy new hole and electron transport materials in tin PSCs to increase device efficiency and stability. Forming DJ phase 2D/3D hybrid tin perovskites represents a paradigm shift in tackling the challenge of efficiency and stability of tin-based PSCs. The intellectual merit is driven by our hypotheses: (1) the defects can be significantly reduced and the tin oxidation can be effectively suppressed by adopting large A?-site divalent cations and pseudohalide anions to form 2D/3D bulk and planar heterojunction tin perovskites; and (2) the energy losses can be significantly reduced and the device stability can be greatly enhanced by utilizing newly developed hole and electron transport materials to guide perovskite growth and passivate defects, respectively. By fundamentally understanding the structural and optoelectronic properties of DJ phase 2D/3D tin pseudohalide perovskites, the effect of functionalized hole transport layer on the growth of perovskites, and the non-fullerene acceptor interaction with perovskites, the general principles to guide the development of highly efficient, stable tin PSCs can be elucidated, which could lead to the transformation of clean energy techniques.?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this need, this award will enable Wistar Institute to entirely re-design an existing hands-on, mentored technician training program and expand it to additional community colleges. The project will provide students with research experiences required for employment as technicians in biomedical research. Students will participate in an accelerated, paid summer program that includes pre-apprenticeship training, a hands-on Orientation at Wistar, and two full-time mentored laboratory experiences. Program graduates will be prepared for immediate employment as laboratory technicians or for advanced training through Wistar?s Biomedical Research Technician Apprenticeship program. The project aims to engage a diverse and underrepresented student population in life sciences research, while offering a direct path to employment as a laboratory technician. The project will address the compelling need to prepare community college students who have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic for employment in the skilled biotechnology workforce. This program can also serve as a model for other community colleges and scientific research partners.<br/><br/>The project has three primary goals: 1) Expand to recruit more students, including  those from new community college partners, while developing articulation agreements that make the project a credit-bearing experience; 2) Develop  a novel project-based curriculum that more effectively engages students, especially those from underrepresented groups, in biotechnology research skills training; and 3) Redesign the existing two-summer program as a one-summer experience that includes full-time internships in both academic and industry labs. The project will use Wistar?s interactive trainee website to maintain data, measure student outcomes, track career development, and provide networking opportunities. The project will also compare participation and outcomes of students in Wistar?s existing two-summer program with those in the new one-summer option.  The project plans to map specific skills and competency standards, as well as disseminate training models and materials. It is anticipated that the project can provide a blueprint for incorporating biotechnician pre-apprenticeship training into biotechnology and science curricula at community colleges, while serving as a model for regional program expansion.

This REU Site project is unique in that it offers an entrepreneurship-integrated, applied energy research experience in the Midwest United States. The concentration on entrepreneurship-integration will lead to new product development skillsets including customer discovery and business model validation. By the end of the summer program, students are expected to ?get out of the building? and conduct a minimum quantity of customer discovery interviews, as the first step in the commercialization process. The customer discovery process will assist students in establishing the motivation for applied energy research first-hand. The intentions behind the concentration on applied energy research supports NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science. First, energy generation and distribution methods have been evolving rapidly over the last few years. Bulk energy production done by large-scale energy generators is being complemented by small-scale energy production, where local homeowners are the greatest beneficiaries of smart grid technology and smart energy generation and distribution techniques. However, the increased number of players, variability in electricity production, and potential for bad actors poses challenges and risks to the energy infrastructure resulting in increased costs to the grid. All five REU projects are aimed to combat these challenges and risks.<br/><br/>This REU experience will empower students to develop an entrepreneurial mindset, enhancing their research toolbox and skillset. The project will recruit junior and senior level engineering and engineering technology students.  The intended impact is twofold. First, is the professional development of 30 undergraduate students (across three years) in an experience that encapsulates both applied energy research and entrepreneurially-minded new product development. Second, is the quality of professional development in better preparing students to enter industry or academia, upon completion of the degree. The intellectual contributions involve building knowledge within applied energy new product development. The proposed energy research projects will support the broad initiatives of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and National Academy of Engineering. This project will contribute to society through a direct impact on 30 undergraduates d in STEM. In addition, the new product development component of the student research experience will inform the faculty-driven research agenda (and subsequent entrepreneurial activities), thus improving the quality and customer focus of the applied research initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disinfection use to kill SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces and for handwashing has increased dramatically in response to the pandemic. A large number of disinfectants have been approved for usage as SARS-CoV-2 disinfectants, many of which contain quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). QACs will inevitably be sent to wastewater treatment plants and some will end up in receiving waters. The effect of these disinfection chemicals on the operation of wastewater treatment plants and receiving waters is largely unknown. These compounds may also contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance microorganisms, an issue of global health importance. The goal of this project is to address these major gaps in our knowledge on QACs to provide information to help limit any environmental impact. The goal will be achieved by assessing QACs in wastewater treatment plants and determine what happens to them in different plant processes and receiving waters. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide the information needed to assess the risk of QACs to protect public health while minimizing environmental persistence and impacts. The project will lead to collaborations with wastewater treatment systems operators to improve operations and the development of educational videos for middle school environmental science students to enhance scientific literacy of the Nation.<br/><br/>Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are active ingredients in over 200 disinfectants currently recommended for use to kill the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Increased use of these disinfectants for hand washing and surface cleaning continues, and the biological impacts of increasing chemical loadings to wastewater treatment plants and surface waters is largely unknown. The goal of this work is to assess the potential impacts of increased QAC loadings to wastewater treatment plants and subsequently aquatic and soil environments. This goal will be achieved through specific research objectives to: 1) Assess QAC levels in wastewater treatment facilities, surface waters, and sediments; 2) Quantify degradation rate constants for QACs and predict persistence in surface waters; and 3) Understand how increased QAC loadings to anaerobic digesters and water environments affects antibiotic resistance. Twelve wastewater treatment plants employing various biological and chemical treatment processes will be sampled seasonally for three years to assess influent, liquid effluent, and biosolids effluent QAC loadings. Sediment samples near outfalls will also be sampled. A mass balance on QACs across individual unit operations will be conducted at two treatment plants. Lab-scale biodegradation and photolysis experiments will be conducted to generate rate removal constants to predict persistence in environmental waters. Lab-scale anaerobic digester experiments will be conducted to determine the impact of increasing concentrations of specific QAC classes on antibiotic resistance. Samples from full-scale plants will also be analyzed for changes in antibiotic resistance. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic brings large uncertainty regarding the amount of QACs that will be used and their specific environmental impacts. By combining lab-scale and full-scale studies we will generate data on classes of QACs and individual QACs that can be used for risk assessments and assessing their impacts on antibiotic resistance. This research is timely and transformative given the expectation of increased loadings of QACs due to the COVID-19 pandemic and long-term changes in consumer and business purchasing of products containing QACs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing approaches for drinking water treatment have tradeoffs. For example, treatment with chlorine can create harmful substances, and ultraviolet light and ozone require high energy and can be expensive. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to develop new materials that can harness visible light inexpensively to generate reactive oxygen species as disinfectants to kill pathogens in water. The newly designed materials will be tested for the ability to kill a range of pathogens, including the microorganism that causes Legionellosis, a deadly disease responsible for >$400 million/year in healthcare costs in the US. The scientific discoveries from this research will be used to improve public awareness of safe drinking water through a podcast in which the public will submit questions. Podcast listening has significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting this will be an effective mode of engaging the general public. The investigator will also develop a Science Through Storytelling program to enhance K-6 student knowledge using the relatable context of drinking water to develop positive attitudes and sense of identification around STEM topics. <br/><br/>This CAREER proposal combines fundamental science and principles of environmental engineering to develop graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) water treatment technologies leveraging energy-efficient LEDs. g-C3N4 is a non-metal, visible-light photocatalyst that is synthesized using low cost, abundant precursors, making it a promising alternative photocatalyst for drinking water treatment. While modifications of g-C3N4 chemistry have been pursued to improve photocatalytic performance, the link between molecular structure, physicochemical properties, and microorganism inactivation is not fully resolved. The overall goal of this work is to establish a rational design framework for visible-light enabled, sustainable water disinfection by connecting g-C3N4 properties to both material chemistry and antimicrobial efficacy. Doing so will enable intentional material design adaptable to a range of water matrices and target bacteria. An important advance of this research includes expanded inactivation testing of drinking water pathogens like Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and nontuberculous mycobacteria. This will provide more relevant results for water treatment, given that >90% of current studies have focused only on Escherichia coli inactivation. Finally, this research will integrate life cycle and economic feasibility assessment to ensure sustainable advancement of photocatalytic water disinfection. The PI will work with (i) K-6 students in a newly developed Science Through Storytelling program, (ii) 6-12 students through the Carnegie Science Center?s annual SciTech Days, and (iii) the general public in a podcast focused on drinking water questions and concerns sourced from our community. Through these activities, the PI aims to demonstrate how the public can become active participants in developing innovative science and engineering solutions to the grand challenge of sustainably providing safe drinking water.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High-performing MFI zeolite membranes on hollow fiber supports will enable development of new and more efficient separation technologies for the chemical and petroleum industries by significantly improving purity, heightening flux, and minimizing capital and operating costs. Due to the unique pore structure of MFI zeolite crystals, b-oriented MFI zeolite membranes offer better molecular sieving separation characteristics than randomly oriented polycrystalline MFI zeolite membranes. These properties make b-oriented MFI zeolite membranes highly attractive for industrial applications including separation of xylene isomers. However, high quality b-oriented MFI zeolite membranes have been fabricated only on disk supports by complex synthesis methods that include the use of costly organic-templates. Such templated MFI zeolite membranes also exhibit unfavorable pressure dependence of separation properties, characterized by a decrease of permeability and selectivity with increasing feed xylene vapor pressure. Several challenges must be addressed to further advance the synthesis of b-oriented MFI zeolite membranes beyond the laboratory scale. These challenges include synthesis of high-quality b-oriented MFI zeolite membrane on supports that can be arranged into modules with high packing density by cost-effective and scalable methods and understanding the separation characteristics of b-oriented MFI zeolite membranes in contact with feed mixtures at high vapor pressures. This project will therefore develop methods for facile syntheses of high-quality b-oriented MFI zeolite membranes on hollow fiber supports and study the synthesis-structure-separation property relationship of such grown b-oriented MFI zeolite membranes for use in the separation of xylene isomers at high vapor pressures. The knowledge developed through this project will be translatable to other-oriented crystalline microporous membranes for other separation processes. In addition to graduate student training opportunities, the broader impacts of the project include a public outreach activity aimed at demonstrating how inorganic membranes work.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the synthesis of b-oriented MFI zeolite membranes on alumina hollow fiber supports by a scalable, template-free synthesis method. The method will consist of filtration ?seeding? using 2-dimensional MFI zeolite nanosheets, followed by template-free secondary growth. Preparation of a zeolite layer using 2-dimensional MFI zeolite nanosheets by filtration offers a versatile and scalable method of fabrication leading to a high-quality b-oriented MFI zeolite seed layer for secondary growth. The MFI zeolite seed layer will be preferentially grown into a b-oriented MFI zeolite membrane with a template-free synthesis solution of optimized composition. The use of a template-free solution produces zeolite membranes of higher quality by minimizing or eliminating intercrystalline gaps that permit non-selective diffusion of gas or liquid mixtures. It also reduces the number of synthesis steps and eliminates the use of costly organic templates. Synthesis of templated and template-free, randomly and b-oriented MFI zeolite membranes enables a systematic study of the synthesis-structure-separation property relationship of the MFI zeolite membranes. In particular, the study will be focused on understanding the effects crystal shape/orientation, intercrystalline microstructure, and zeolite framework composition on the feed pressure dependence of xylene permeability and selectivity of MFI zeolite membranes. This work will also identify conditions for the synthesis of high-performance b-oriented MFI zeolite membranes for effective separation of xylene mixture under industrially relevant conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacteria-based chemical production represents an alternative to petrochemical processes due to the microbes? evolved ability to utilize diverse feedstocks and synthesize a broad array of biochemicals. However, the effectiveness of microbial systems has only been demonstrated at large scale for a limited number of applications, such as conversion of corn-derived sugar to the fuel additive ethanol. To succeed in the marketplace, microbial systems must offer more flexibility with respect to the feedstock they consume as well as the biochemicals they produce. Industrial waste gases rich in CO and CO2 represent an abundant and cheap source of carbon for upgrading to more valuable chemicals. Over the past decade, gas fermentation with CO2-consuming (acetogenic) bacteria has been shown to be a promising technology for large-scale conversion of such waste gases to ethanol. However, gas conversion to more valuable chemical products is considerably more challenging. The goal of this project is to develop the gas fermentation process simulation and optimization technology necessary to advance microbial systems for large-scale production of platform chemicals, the building blocks of a wide range of chemical products. The proposed research will significantly advance a novel microbial paradigm for conversion of cheap waste gases into value-added products by focusing on critical process systems engineering challenges. The research team will recruit women and URM students into the project through the NSF-sponsored Northeast Alliance in Minority and Graduate Education and the Professoriate program at UMass.<br/><br/>Large-scale gas fermentation requires specialized bubble column reactor technologies and sophisticated operating strategies to maintain desirable multiphase hydrodynamics, achieve high gas-liquid mass transfer rates, minimize the inhibitory effects of dissolved gases and synthesized byproducts on cellular growth, achieve high cell densities, and ensure high volumetric productivity over a range of feed conditions. While bubble column reactors have been extensively investigated for CO fermentation, studies have been limited to acetogen monocultures and existing process engineering challenges have received very little attention. We have been developing a bubble column modeling approach based on combining genome-scale stoichiometric models of microbial metabolism with multiphase transport equations governing column hydrodynamics. In this project, these sophisticated models consisting of linear programs (LPs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) will be utilized to develop dynamic process modeling and optimization strategies for coculture bubble column reactors. Our target is the conversion of CO-rich gas streams containing CO2 and/or H2 to the platform chemicals butyrate and 2,3-butanediol. The proposed research has three specific aims: (1) Perform monoculture and coculture continuous-flow stirred tank reactor experiments with the acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum and computationally identify promising gut bacteria by quantifying their metabolic activity; (2) Develop dynamic models of bubble column bioreactors for in silico investigation of coculture stability and performance for different gut bacteria paired with C. autoethanogenum; and (3) Perform rigorous optimization of the most promising coculture systems to determine dynamic startup and steady-state operating policies to maximize volumetric productivity. Collectively, the three aims will yield innovations in bioreactor process engineering through the systematic development of optimization approaches for LP-PDE models and in gas fermentation for renewable chemical production through the integrated development of dynamic modeling and optimization technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on the evolutionary history of these pathogens, examining how the genomes of oral pathogens differ across a comparative sample of primate species, and, within humans, how they are impacted by changes in dietary practices, geographic space, and time. Through this comparative research and the study of oral pathogen genomes recovered from ancient human populations, this project advances knowledge about pathogen evolution in humans over thousands of years and provides further insight into the relationships between host behavior and pathogen evolution. The project benefits from a team-science approach that involves close collaboration, as well as academic attribution, for descendent communities of the ancient human populations being studied. Project findings are communicated to these communities through public talks focusing on the impact of oral disease, contextualized by microbiome research. The project also contributes to the professional development of researchers through online workshops focusing on ancient microbiome data analysis, supports open science by publication in open-access journals and sharing data through public repositories, and promotes the broader participation of women in STEM through student training and mentoring activities.<br/><br/>The transition from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural lifestyle, as well as the advent of industrialization, are thought to have increased the prevalence of oral disease in humans. However, the way that these transitions affected oral pathogens at a genomic level, especially in terms of their diversity and virulence, have not been fully characterized. Additionally, the broader primate comparative context of oral pathogen diversity is not well understood. In this project, the investigators reconstruct oral pathogen genomes from dental calculus, a calcified form of dental plaque. Dental calculus is known to preserve biomolecules for thousands of years and provides a wealth of information regarding the host, oral bacteria, and diet. Calculus samples are collected from museum specimens of nonhuman primates (chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans), and from ancient human populations from the continents of Africa and the Americas. From both continents, samples are retrieved from the same geographic location but from time periods associated with different dietary strategies (hunter-gatherer versus agriculture). The investigators use state-of-the-art ancient DNA protocols, metagenomic sequencing, and target enrichment strategies to generate high-quality genome data for oral pathogens found in these samples. These genome data provide a nuanced understanding of the evolutionary relationships between oral pathogen strains affecting different host species, and how oral pathogen strain diversity and genomic architecture have changed over time and space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Air inside homes, schools, offices, and other buildings constantly interchanges with outside air. It is thus important to understand how this interchange affects air pollution in both spaces to fully assess human health risk. This is particularly true as outdoor pollution in the USA has decreased in recent decades while indoor sources of air pollution become more important. The goal of this project is to understand how air pollutants known as aerosols (suspensions of fine particles in air) change while they are transported between indoor and outdoor environments. This goal will be achieved through a combination of experiments in laboratory and real-world settings to measure physical and chemical transformations of aerosols. Successful completion of this research will contribute new knowledge about aerosols to protect human health. The research program will be integrated with educational activities to train the next generation of scientists. A key aspect of this effort is a focus on training scientists to become better public communicators to help improve the Nation?s STEM workforce and increase scientific literacy.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to investigate how physical properties of aerosols change once they are transported between indoor and outdoor environments.

Successful completion of this research will generate novel data on secondary organic aerosol precursors that are emitted by indoor activities to contextualize the evidence of indoor air pollutants found in outdoor field campaigns. This work will also inform efforts by environmental health and epidemiological professionals to protect human health, as well as contribute to the development of better instrumentation and low-cost sensors.

Computational modeling can complement or replace laboratory studies, animal trials, or clinical trials in many situations relating to FDA approval of medical devices. Its potential has yet to be fully realized because no standardized or industry accepted workflow or appraisal metrics exist for using computational models in developing or assessing medical devices. The goal for this project is to elevate computational modeling and simulation from scientific research tools to high-quality regulatory tools. Increasing the role of computational evidence will accelerate innovation and regulatory decision-making of medical devices. The project will also increase the knowledge base about reproducible computations, and increase the level of comfort for reviewers handling computational evidence. Communicating this knowledge to industry will increase the quality of device submissions. Longer term, transparency and reproducibility standards in regulatory grade computational modeling can lead to a change in culture, building more trust in computational evidence in this sphere.<br/><br/>This one-year project is a proof-of-concept workflow and pilot study for generating trustworthy computational evidence for regulatory non-clinical evaluation of medical device safety and efficacy. The proof-of-concept application for this project is an electronic drug delivery system (EDDS) prototype, an electronic inhaler based on e-cigarette devices. This study in the context of regulatory science builds on, adapts, and expands a framework of reproducibility, now becoming established in meta-research. In the process, this study supports regulators and industry in understanding rigorous and trustworthy computational evidence for the EDDS prototype, drawing upon computational fluid dynamics models and best practices for digital evidence. The provenance of all the research artifacts and empirical results will be rigorously captured, recorded, and curated including, for example, data, code, parameters, computational environment, and computational workflow.

In order to understand how the magnetic field of the Earth protects life from electrically charged particles streaming from the sun, or to generate clean energy from nuclear fusion, one has to understand how a plasma behaves in a magnetic field.  This is one of the key problems in the field of plasma physics. This project will provide a detailed understanding of the behavior of plasmas trapped by a magnetic field. The plasma will be created in a highly controlled manner that results in an ultracold plasma, which is colder than outer space. Such low temperatures make it easier to isolate different processes in the system for study, such as the rate at which particles escape from the trap. Surprisingly, an ultracold plasma shows behavior that is similar to hot and dense astrophysical plasmas, so these experiments can answer fundamental questions on the properties of objects such as white dwarf stars, which can possess strong magnetic fields. The project will also train students in a broad set of technical skills so they can contribute to the STEM workforce. Outreach and recruiting efforts will be pursued in order to increase participation by students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This project will combine recently developed tools for laser cooling ions in an ultracold neutral plasma (UCNP) with magnetic-confinement techniques. This offers exciting opportunities for discovery plasma science, such as characterizing equilibration and transport phenomena in crossover regimes of magnetization and Coulomb-interaction (or ?coupling?) strength. Combining laser and magnetic forces may provide a solution for long-standing challenges to plasma confinement in a quadrupole magnetic-field geometry, namely the escape of plasma through loss gaps along field lines. The combination of strong coupling and magnetization modifies transport phenomena and collective modes, and has attracted increasing interest from the dusty and high-energy-density plasma communities. These experiments will create a new system for probing this physics, and will test recent theories describing collisional processes in this regime. The specific goals are to (1) characterize the loss processes and scaling of magnetic confinement times with magnetic field for UCNPs formed in a quadrupole magnetic field, (2) measure the self-diffusion constant for magnetized ions and observe effects of strong coupling, and (3) use laser forces to plug loss gaps that typically allow plasma to escape along guiding-center magnetic field lines in a quadrupole magnetic field, creating long-term confinement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How the host responds to the chemicals will be assessed by measuring changes in the host's proteins, RNA, and metabolites. This work supports the training and mentoring of underrepresented/underresourced postdoctoral and undergraduate trainees in themes bridging the chemical, biological, and environmental sciences. Four postdoctoral investigators will participate in course-based undergraduate research experiences with Haverford faculty with the goal of building supportive scholar-teacher mentoring networks with students and providing training in equitable and inclusive course design so that the scholars becoming more reflective, engaged, and effective teachers. All four PIs will develop conference-based experiential workshops to provide career development.<br/><br/>Microbes have emerged as key players in marine systems where they form complex relationships with eukaryotic phytoplankton. These interactions range from symbiotic to pathogenic and are tightly regulated through the dynamic exchange of small molecule chemical messengers that shape communities and influence the biogeochemical fate of oceanic nutrients. Efforts to elucidate the exchange of chemical signals and decipher the environmental drivers of bacterial-phytoplankton interactions are limited and met with substantial technical challenges. Recently, two chemical messengers, tetrabromopyrrole (TBP) and 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ), both produced by the globally distributed marine gamma proteobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas, have been identified to govern the physiology of its associated, bloom-forming single-cell algal host, Emiliania huxleyi, with contrasting modalities. Experiments outlined in this study are poised to tease apart the metabolic landscape defining this model host-bacterial symbiosis, and detail when and how chemical messengers induce host metabolic reprogramming resulting in ecosystem level consequences. Three synergistic aims will be accomplished: in the first, TBP and HHQ production and uptake will be measured in response to nutrient variability and HHQ production will be captured at the single-cell level using biosensors. In the second aim, experiments will reveal metabolic cross-talk by establishing the metabolomic and proteomic response of E. huxleyi to both P. piscicida and HHQ, while tracking P. piscicida uptake of E. huxleyi-derived metabolites. In the third, experiments will investigate if HHQ prevents E. huxleyi viral entry using electron microscopy, accounting for an earlier observation that viral-induced mortality of E. huxleyi is stalled in the presence of HHQ.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coral reefs support diverse ocean life and sustain economic growth in coastal areas. Coral reefs are imperiled by disease outbreaks, climate change, and anthropogenic activities. Specifically, SCTLD is spreading unabated in Florida and the Caribbean and has infected over 20 coral species.  Despite this spread, the understanding of chemical changes that accompany the onset of disease, the changes in bacterial inhabitants, and the disruption of the coral-algal symbiosis, remains poorly known. The principal investigator will elucidate the chemical changes that occur during SCTLD progression in corals using multi-omics and data analytic strategies. The bacteria and algae that may be responsible for these chemical changes will be identified. Knowledge gained from this research will provide understanding of the chemical and organismal signatures that define health or disease status of corals. To enhance the reach of this research, teaching modules will be created for high school, undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 teachers. Introduction of high school students to the effects of climate change on coral reefs and role of STEM in understanding disease mechanisms may enhance student participation in STEM fields and serve as a strong scientific foundation for these students.  <br/><br/>Very little is known about pathogenic mechanisms in marine environments. Unabated spread of SCTLD provides a unique opportunity to understand pathogenesis in the marine environment.

This research will provide fundamental insights into 1) natural product metabolites that co-occur with pathogenic microbial consortia, 2) natural products that are produced by the microbiome and the endosymbionts prior to onset of disease and during recovery post-treatment, and 3) how changes in the microbiome during disease are linked to changes in the chemical makeup of corals across different species. The paired metabolomics and 16S amplicon sequencing data generated in this proposal is the first step towards building future efforts in integrating metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data to understand molecular markers underlying SCTLD and to delineate biochemical pathways underlying coral host-microbe, host-algal symbiont, and host-pathogen relationships.

Data-driven design of materials with tailored properties has become increasingly viable with the expansion of computing resources, algorithmic advances, and growing databases. However, it remains challenging in practice to explore vast search spaces, and data-driven models still face difficulties with limited accuracy and interpretability. In this project, the research team will study the central hypothesis that materials properties for certain classes of materials such as Zintl phases are more accurately modeled through interactions between groups of atoms within a structure rather than interactions between individual atoms. This physical intuition will be used to build a new suite of methods integrating advanced computer simulations with state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models for enabling fast inverse materials design. In addition to improving accuracy and speed, these methods will be designed to enable interpretation and scientific understanding of the important interactions between groups of atoms in the material that contribute to desired properties. The research team will use these methods to discover new Zintl phases and work with experimental collaborators to validate their discoveries. The interdisciplinary research team of computational materials scientists and computer scientists is well positioned to advance knowledge in these challenging problems of fundamental and technological interest. This project also supports training of graduate and undergraduate students to be the next generation of leaders in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of materials and data science.

Computational design of new materials has become increasingly viable with advances in computing power and methodologies. However, exploration of large chemical spaces with millions of compounds is still computationally intractable for ab-initio methods. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a means to accelerate such large explorations, but popular ML methods still have limitations in accuracy and interpretability. In this project, the research team will develop novel computational methods for materials design focused on the central idea that crystal properties are better modeled through interactions between motifs (groups of atoms) within a structure rather than between individual atoms. The team will apply this idea to design new Zintl phases, where the structural motifs strongly influence functional properties. Zintl phases are an under-explored class of compounds, presenting opportunities to discover and design new phases. The ultimate goal of this project is to discover Zintl phases with new compositions and structure types and learn relationships between their compositions, structural motifs, and functional properties that will allow inverse design of Zintl phases with tailored properties. The team will use chemical decorations and Lego-like assembly to ""construct"" Zintl phases and develop hierarchical graph representation algorithms to automatically learn the relationships between structural motifs and functional properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support human life, water flow commonly occurs through thousands of miles of blood vessels to provide cells with nutrients and remove their waste products. In the absence of blood flow, cells suffocate or starve. Electrically driven water flow between cells provides significant advantages over pressure driven flow for promoting cell survival in the absence of blood flow.   This approach will be useful for promoting cell survival during tissue engineering prior to building of a new blood vessel network. This project may also reveal how electricity promotes healing of degenerative diseases caused by damaged or absent blood vessels. As part of the educational broader impacts of this project, investigators will provide cross-disciplinary training for student researchers and provide professional development workshops for secondary-school science teachers to enhance their ability to integrate tissue engineering modules into their classrooms.<br/><br/>Soft tissue repair is often plagued by poor or absent blood flow, and interstitial flow in the extracellular matrix and around cells is lost.  This project will characterize the effects of interstitial flow on cellular viability and proliferation using fluorescent assays, when interstitial flow is generated by electricity or pressure.  In addition, mechanosensitive pathways used by cells to sense electrically driven water flow will be characterized using a combination of real-time fluorescence imaging and protein manipulation.  Finally, applied electric fields are well known to polarize cells in 2D culture but their usefulness in 3D culture is unknown.  Electrically driven water flow will be tested to polarize cells in 3D culture, in order to help direct growth of new tissues required for repair of damaged tissues.  Results from this work will be influential for guiding current medical interventions for soft tissue repair during physical therapies, surgical methods, and survival of tissues and organs during advanced tissue engineering.

Currently available low-carbon cement substitutes exhibit slow reactivity, and their availability continues to decline as the key supplier industries are phasing out for environmental reasons. The ability to predict and design the reactivity of low-carbon cement substitutes remains limited because of the poor understanding of the basic mechanisms that govern these reactions. This research aims to provide fundamental insight into the multiscale mechanisms that govern the reactivity of calcium aluminosilicate glasses, which are the main reactive phases in cement substitute materials. A comprehensive outreach plan developed in collaboration with local non-profit partners will also be implemented. The focus of the outreach plan is to promote scientific literacy and environmental leadership among K-12 students, especially those from underserved communities and underrepresented minorities in STEM. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the dissolution and reactivity of calcium aluminosilicate glasses as a function of glass structure and composition. The research will combine a multiscale framework based on density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, together with glass characterization, dissolution measurements, and reactivity testing. This hybrid approach will bridge the gap between molecular-level understanding of glass reactivity and macroscopic reactivity measured in experiments. This research will result in the following outcomes: (1) full characterization of the reactivity spectrum of calcium aluminosilicate glasses at the molecular level, (2) fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that govern the dissolution behavior of calcium aluminosilicate glasses at the mesoscale, and (3) comprehensive understanding of the relationship between glass structure/composition, dissolution, and reactivity for a wide range of glass compositions. The findings from this work will shed light into the reactivity of disordered materials, which has broad cross-disciplinary applications, and will pave the way for the rational design of highly reactive low-carbon cement substitutes, a key step towards sustainable concrete.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More recently, researchers have created LEDs that can shine high-energy ultraviolet (UV) rays. UV rays have been widely used in various fields, including in the water treatment industry to kill germs and to remove pollutants in water. However, the adoption of UV technology in the water industry has been hindered by relatively higher cost and low energy efficiency. UV LEDs have many advantages over existing UV light technology due to greater energy efficiency, greater durability, lower cost, and ability for digital interfacing. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop the first Smart UV LED systems utilizing novel rapid pulsed UV LEDs. This will be achieved through a series of experiments to understand the mechanisms for UV catalyzed chemical reactions to kill pathogens and degrade pollutants. Successful completion of this research will provide benefits globally through the development of hand-held devices for more efficient treatment of water at lower cost in remote places.

The project is designed to increase the participation of individuals from Hispanic communities in plant/agricultural biotechnology.  To do so, the project team will develop stackable credentials that prepare students to enter the region?s plant/agricultural biotechnology workforce and can lead to an new associate degree in plant/agriculture biotechnology. This degree program will be designed in collaboration with local industry partners and stakeholders in K- 14 education.

The project expects this approach will increase the interest and success in the skilled biotechnology workforce for second-generation Hispanic youth. As a result, the project has the potential to help diversify the STEM technical workforce and ensure that students of color become members of the next generation of scientists.  In doing so, the project can help to mitigate the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the communities it will serve.<br/><br/>Using evidence-based strategies identified for Hispanic Serving Institutions, the project will: 1) develop two stackable certificates, based on courses in biotechnology, plant tissue culture, and genetics, that lead to an associate of science degree in plant/agricultural biotechnoloy; 2) provide high school faculty with professional development and create a pipeline of prospective students into the associate degree program by increasing awareness and providing hands-on experience in biotechnology; 3) offer institutional, student-centric support and engage students in work-based learning experiences in plant/agricultural biotechnology; 4) expand collaboration and partnerships with local agriculture biotechnology industries that can prepare Hispanic students for emerging technical jobs, including those in the field of agricultural biodiagnostics.  This training will enable Hispanic students to develop skills that are transferable to other sectors and help to alleviate the shortage of skilled technical workers in the state.  In addition, this funding can generate revenue needed to sustain the degree program, helping to alleviate COVID-19-related impacts on the College itself.

With the urgent threats of climate change we need new tools to quicken the pace of species discovery within these collections to better conserve species before they go extinct. A United Nations report indicates that more than one million species are at risk of extinction, and amid this dire prediction a recent estimate suggests plants are disappearing more quickly than animals. There are approximately 3,000 herbaria worldwide and they are massive repositories of plant diversity data: these collections not only represent a vast amount of plant diversity, but since herbarium collections include specimens dating back hundreds of years, they provide snapshots of plant diversity through time. Herbarium specimens not only maintain their morphological features but also include collection dates and locations. This information, multiplied by millions of plant collections, provides the framework for understanding plant diversity on a massive scale and learning how it has changed over time. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that can vastly accelerate species discovery in herbaria. This project will provide training and professional development opportunities for a post-doctoral researcher.<br/><br/>This project will develop a tool for rapid curation and identification of plant specimens from herbaria collections using AI: this easy-to-use online tool, iCurate, will be readily used by herbaria world-wide to automatically identify and curate herbarium specimens by inputting their own specimen images. This tool will be built from the wide range of digitized vascular plant specimens present in the GBIF and iDigBio databases, significantly reducing the time to identify specimens and allowing herbaria to curate plant groups for which they lack expertise. The iCurate tool will be optimized and expanded through a stepwise process that uses crowd-sourced AI models submitted to a series of online competitions. The competitions will use an ever- increasing number of species and images for model training eventually including all public vascular plant specimen images in GBIF and iDigBio.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(CISS) effect at the nanoscale. CISS is an unusual behavior first observed in  biological structures,  and  only  later  harnessed for technological applications. It describes the fact that, at  room temperature,  electron  transport  through molecules with chiral (or mirror) symmetry -- e.g., DNA -- favors particular states of a quantum property called spin. Such a spin preference effectively translates into more efficient electron transport through chiral molecules than through achiral ones, and this property has justifiably attracted significant interest. Enantiomers (chiral molecules that are mirror images of one another) have opposite electron spin orientation preferences, which could inform drug development; and any technology that  relies  on  optimal  charge  transport ? i.e.,  the  entire  electronics industry ? could profit from harnessing and controlling CISS-like effects. CISS might also have tremendous biological implications for signaling, as proteins and most biomolecules are chiral. This research falls within the emergent field of ?quantum biology? that studies how the laws of quantum mechanics might play a role in biological function. This work will foment the creation of the first US-based virtual Quantum Biology Center. Such a center will become a natural organizing structure for quantum biology practitioners to interact, collaborate and disseminate their findings to the broader public.  The Center members will demystify and critique potentially dubious claims of quantum effects in biology and place this field on firm scientific ground in the public eye. The Center will also catalyze events such as weekly online meetings on quantum biology, already being organized by the PI for over a year.<br/><br/>The chiral-induced  spin  selectivity  (CISS) describes  the  fact  that,  at  room temperature,  charge  transport  through  chiral  molecules  favors  a  particular  electronic  spin orientation (or ?spin polarization?). Because of the CISS effect, enantiomers have opposite electron spin orientation preferences.  This observation might have tremendous biological implications, as proteins and most biomolecules are chiral. An unambiguous understanding of CISS at the nanoscale is still lacking. Here the investigators propose to elucidate the mechanisms behind CISS in DNA at the nanoscale. Currently, CISS is studied using chemistry techniques (ex.: electrochemistry, I-V curves) relying on ensembles of chiral nanostructures interacting with electron spins in ?classical states?; this precludes, respectively, quantitative measurements of total charge going through the chiral structures and of how spins in ?non-trivial quantum states? (e.g., spin superpositions) evolve when transported through such chiral molecules. The proposed setup ? a ESR-STM working with a single chiral molecule that gets injected with electron spins in ?non-trivial quantum states? ? will overcome the present experimental limitations and thus enable a predictable, quantitative understanding of CISS using the language and tools of quantum mechanics. The investigators will attach DNA under different conditions (e.g., slightly different temperatures, a variety of DNA lengths) to the tip of the ESR-STM and use magnetic resonance techniques to prepare electrons in arbitrary spin states, which will then be injected into the molecule. By characterizing how the electron coherences are transported through the different nano-chiral potentials, it becomes possible to harness quantum degrees of freedom to hijack and drive both physiology and biological signal processing, and to mimic strategies developed and optimized by nature over millions of years to transduce quantum information. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in Biological Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High-temperature power electronics can increase the power density of transportation systems by reducing the size and weight of the cooling system, and enabling the power converter to be placed in strategic locations with high ambient temperatures, such as in close proximity to the engine or motor. However, higher temperatures degrade the performance and reliability of present power electronics components. This project aims to overcome these challenges and develop a high-temperature gallium oxide power module. Gallium oxide is an ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor that is emerging as a viable candidate for high-temperature power electronics due to its advantageous material properties. The intellectual merits of the project include understanding of semiconductor device and package electro-thermal interactions, solutions for high-temperature package encapsulants and semiconductor device gate dielectrics, and strategies for thermal management. The broader impacts of the project include insight into the possibilities and challenges for gallium-oxide-based power electronics, and advancements in high-temperature packaging, which could allow for more-efficient and higher-density electric transportation and harsh-environment systems. Other broader impacts of the project include undergraduate and graduate education on power electronics packaging and ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductors, and diversity and inclusion activities, such as hands-on workshops, laboratory tours, and demonstrations for women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Extreme temperatures challenge the limits of silicon power semiconductors, and diminish the performance benefits of wide-bandgap devices. While gallium oxide is a promising alternative due to its superior thermal stability, it has low thermal conductivity, which creates additional challenges for the package and thermal management system. Another major challenge is the reliability of the power electronics package under high temperature conditions. In particular, a key limitation for high-temperature power modules is the encapsulation. The encapsulation provides essential electrical insulation, as well as corrosion resistance and protection. Traditional polymeric encapsulants degrade rapidly at elevated temperatures. This work aims to overcome these challenges through four main research goals: 1) to develop an electro-thermal, device-package co-design framework that will enable physical insights into the device-package interdependencies, and accelerate the design of power modules optimized for emerging power semiconductor devices; 2) to evaluate and apply new dielectric materials for use as the high-temperature power module encapsulant, and as the gate dielectric and passivation for the gallium oxide power device; 3) to explore innovative heat dissipation strategies at the device and package levels for improved thermal performance of gallium-oxide-based power modules; and 4) to demonstrate a high-temperature gallium oxide power module, and assess its electrical, thermal, and reliability characteristics. The knowledge gained from this work will illuminate the potential of gallium oxide power devices, and enable significant improvements in high-temperature packaging, which could facilitate major advancements in electric transportation and harsh environment applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advancements in analytical techniques have revealed that many host-bacterial interactions are tightly regulated by small molecules, acting as chemical messengers. Yet, connecting how these interactions at the cellular level translate to impacts on whole communities and ecosystems remains an ongoing challenge necessitating cross-disciplinary collaboration. A newly emerging picture suggests that marine bacteria are not passive in their interactions with hosts such as algae; rather bacteria actively mediate the flow of organic matter depending on how they deploy their chemical arsenal. The assembled interdisciplinary team will develop new methods to track and translate complex chemical signals between a model algal host and associated bacteria. New methodologies in fluorescent biosensors will quantify bacterial production of chemical signals at the cellular level, whose release manipulates host physiology. How the host responds to the chemicals will be assessed by measuring changes in the host's proteins, RNA, and metabolites. This work supports the training and mentoring of underrepresented/underresourced postdoctoral and undergraduate trainees in themes bridging the chemical, biological, and environmental sciences. Four postdoctoral investigators will participate in course-based undergraduate research experiences with Haverford faculty with the goal of building supportive scholar-teacher mentoring networks with students and providing training in equitable and inclusive course design so that the scholars becoming more reflective, engaged, and effective teachers. All four PIs will develop conference-based experiential workshops to provide career development.<br/><br/>Microbes have emerged as key players in marine systems where they form complex relationships with eukaryotic phytoplankton. These interactions range from symbiotic to pathogenic and are tightly regulated through the dynamic exchange of small molecule chemical messengers that shape communities and influence the biogeochemical fate of oceanic nutrients. Efforts to elucidate the exchange of chemical signals and decipher the environmental drivers of bacterial-phytoplankton interactions are limited and met with substantial technical challenges. Recently, two chemical messengers, tetrabromopyrrole (TBP) and 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ), both produced by the globally distributed marine gamma proteobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas, have been identified to govern the physiology of its associated, bloom-forming single-cell algal host, Emiliania huxleyi, with contrasting modalities. Experiments outlined in this study are poised to tease apart the metabolic landscape defining this model host-bacterial symbiosis, and detail when and how chemical messengers induce host metabolic reprogramming resulting in ecosystem level consequences. Three synergistic aims will be accomplished: in the first, TBP and HHQ production and uptake will be measured in response to nutrient variability and HHQ production will be captured at the single-cell level using biosensors. In the second aim, experiments will reveal metabolic cross-talk by establishing the metabolomic and proteomic response of E. huxleyi to both P. piscicida and HHQ, while tracking P. piscicida uptake of E. huxleyi-derived metabolites. In the third, experiments will investigate if HHQ prevents E. huxleyi viral entry using electron microscopy, accounting for an earlier observation that viral-induced mortality of E. huxleyi is stalled in the presence of HHQ.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are also significant medical costs associated with falls:  In the United States alone, falls among people who are at least 65-years old incur costs of approximately $50 billion. Conventional approaches to reducing the risk of falling focus on building strength or training people in more effective strategies to recover from loss of balance. However, these approaches fail to address the role of the choices that people make. For example, people may fall because they have difficulty judging risk accurately, overestimate their functional capacity, or tend to be risk tolerant. Developing methods to assess individual differences in risk perception and risk preference during walking could lead to a new class of fall-reducing interventions that improve a person?s ability to identify and avoid potential risks that push them beyond their physical capacity. <br/><br/>Current theoretical models of how humans select features of their walking pattern primarily aim to minimize an energy-related cost in a risk-neutral context. The overall objective of the present work is to extend the current risk-neutral theory to a more generalizable, and clinically relevant, risk-sensitive theory of locomotion. The investigators will use a novel approach to examine how people balance trade-offs between effort and risk during walking through the use of a risk-sensitive decision-making framework. They will also determine if models of risk- and effort-based decision-making in other domains explain age-dependent differences in how people choose between routes associated with varying levels of physical risk and effort. In addition to identifying fundamental principles of behavior selection during walking, the work will also provide high school students with practical experiences working at the intersection of experimental motor control, biomechanics, and game development. The investigators will collaborate with a local high school in Los Angeles to develop project-based activities focused on statistical thinking and biomechanics that align with the Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards.

Harmful mutations are generally understood to cause negative effects by disrupting the normal functions of the affected protein. However, the deleterious effects of mutations might also arise from causing the mutated protein to do things it should not do, such as interfere with unrelated biological processes. This project is a systematic study of the effects of all possible mutations in three proteins. This will contribute to the understanding of how proteins evolve and the mechanisms by which mutations can affect cell physiology. Such knowledge is important for understanding human disease and the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Each year of this research, three graduate students, two undergraduates, and one high school student will be trained in research.  The graduate students will present research at scientific conferences and gain mentorship experience supervising the undergraduate and high school students. <br/><br/>The distribution of fitness effects of mutations plays a central role in setting protein evolution rates, but the molecular underpinnings of this constraint are unclear. One possibility is that mutant proteins misfold or misinteract with other proteins with deleterious consequences. Such effects are examples of collateral fitness effects, as opposed to primary fitness effects that derive from changes in the physiological function of the protein. Very little is known about the frequency, magnitude, and mechanisms of collateral fitness effects, but such information is critical for understanding protein evolution. This research will comprehensively determine the collateral fitness effects of mutations in three proteins using growth competition and next-generation sequencing techniques in Escherichia coli. Molecular biology techniques will be used to discover the mechanisms behind select mutational effects.  This study will generate a wealth of data from which to understand the contribution of collateral fitness effects to evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The World Health Organization estimates that annual deaths due to antibiotic resistant infections could reach 10 million by 2050 if no actions are taken. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) are found in many natural and engineered environments in surface water, soil, and wastewater. ARB in these environments may enter potable water supply and food chains, resulting in human exposure and increased risk. Thus, it is critical to understand and control the emergence and spread of ARB in these environments to better protect human health. The goal of this CAREER research project is to understand how the presence of micropollutants affects the development, proliferation, and transmission of antibiotic resistance under environmentally relevant conditions. This will be achieved by specific research to track the induction of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms exposed to micropollutants through a novel combination of chemistry and molecular biology. Successful completion of this research will advance knowledge of how micropollutants induce antibiotic resistance. Results also have strong potential to improve efforts to monitor and prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance. Dissemination of results to the public on antibiotic resistance issues form the basis of outreach efforts in collaboration with local wastewater treatment plants, high schools, and colleges in the Inland Empire Region of southern California. These efforts will benefit society by educating the public about a critical public health issue and increase the scientific literacy of the Nation. <br/><br/>Although antibiotic resistance selected by increasing concentration of antibiotics has been well studied, there is a critical knowledge gap concerning how the co-occurrence of non-antibiotic micropollutants and antibiotics in the environment influence the development of antibiotic resistance. Preliminary work found that non-antibiotic micropollutants influence the development and transmission of antibiotic resistance in a synergistic manner. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop a mechanistic understanding of this process specifically focusing on the genotype-to-phenotype relationships that underpin the development and transmission of antibiotic resistance. This goal will be achieved through specific research integrating selective growth experiments with systems and molecular biology tools. The genetic basis leading to synergistic antibiotic resistance selection will be first identified and validated via molecular biological tools. Next, the environmental factors that promote the proliferation of resistant mutants selected from the co-exposure of antibiotics and non-antibiotic micropollutants will be examined. Short-term growth competition tests will use co-cultures containing two strains of bacteria with different antibiotic resistance capacity. The fitness of each strain will be assessed during growth using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Lastly, the effect of exposure to non-antibiotic micropollutants on conjugative horizontal gene transfer (HGT) will be determined via mating experiments between the same and different bacterial species. The molecular mechanisms leading to accelerated HGT will be identified by comparative transcriptomics and proteomics. The research program will be integrated with an education and outreach component that emphasizes diversity through activities designed for different groups of learners. Undergraduate workshops and research training programs will be organized to encourage participation of undergraduates in STEM. Online education resources will be developed for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, and open houses and a public website will target local communities to educate the public on antibiotic resistance and promote the proper use and disposal of antibiotics to control its spread.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disinfection use to kill SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces and for handwashing has increased dramatically in response to the pandemic. A large number of disinfectants have been approved for usage as SARS-CoV-2 disinfectants, many of which contain quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). QACs will inevitably be sent to wastewater treatment plants and some will end up in receiving waters. The effect of these disinfection chemicals on the operation of wastewater treatment plants and receiving waters is largely unknown. These compounds may also contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance microorganisms, an issue of global health importance. The goal of this project is to address these major gaps in our knowledge on QACs to provide information to help limit any environmental impact. The goal will be achieved by assessing QACs in wastewater treatment plants and determine what happens to them in different plant processes and receiving waters. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide the information needed to assess the risk of QACs to protect public health while minimizing environmental persistence and impacts. The project will lead to collaborations with wastewater treatment systems operators to improve operations and the development of educational videos for middle school environmental science students to enhance scientific literacy of the Nation.<br/><br/>Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are active ingredients in over 200 disinfectants currently recommended for use to kill the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Increased use of these disinfectants for hand washing and surface cleaning continues, and the biological impacts of increasing chemical loadings to wastewater treatment plants and surface waters is largely unknown. The goal of this work is to assess the potential impacts of increased QAC loadings to wastewater treatment plants and subsequently aquatic and soil environments. This goal will be achieved through specific research objectives to: 1) Assess QAC levels in wastewater treatment facilities, surface waters, and sediments; 2) Quantify degradation rate constants for QACs and predict persistence in surface waters; and 3) Understand how increased QAC loadings to anaerobic digesters and water environments affects antibiotic resistance. Twelve wastewater treatment plants employing various biological and chemical treatment processes will be sampled seasonally for three years to assess influent, liquid effluent, and biosolids effluent QAC loadings. Sediment samples near outfalls will also be sampled. A mass balance on QACs across individual unit operations will be conducted at two treatment plants. Lab-scale biodegradation and photolysis experiments will be conducted to generate rate removal constants to predict persistence in environmental waters. Lab-scale anaerobic digester experiments will be conducted to determine the impact of increasing concentrations of specific QAC classes on antibiotic resistance. Samples from full-scale plants will also be analyzed for changes in antibiotic resistance. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic brings large uncertainty regarding the amount of QACs that will be used and their specific environmental impacts. By combining lab-scale and full-scale studies we will generate data on classes of QACs and individual QACs that can be used for risk assessments and assessing their impacts on antibiotic resistance. This research is timely and transformative given the expectation of increased loadings of QACs due to the COVID-19 pandemic and long-term changes in consumer and business purchasing of products containing QACs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the volume of text data continues to grow, humans alone cannot hope to be able to understand every piece of textual information published. Hence, a need for machine-based methods to extract salient entities along with their relationships from massive textual data is needed. While efforts to develop such methods have proven successful in academia, that success rarely translates over to practitioners employing extraction systems to solve real-world problems. A significant cause of this failure in translation is the requirement of copious amounts of training examples for a machine to learn extraction models. Even when a sufficient number of examples exist, machines learn very rigid methods, such that even a slight misspelling can cause a failure. Therefore, a re-think of how we develop, refine and maintain such machine-based extraction methods is required. This project proposes a new methodology based around the idea of providing explanations for both correct and incorrect decisions made by a machine, with the intention of requiring far fewer examples for machine training, as well as providing a process of softening the rigidity of current extraction methods. <br/><br/>To achieve this goal, this project will solicit (from humans) natural language explanations on how a machine should reason about their task, as well as explanations correcting erroneous reasoning and an alerting system for when a machine?s rationale is possibly going wrong. Rather than treating humans as merely a ?source of labels?, this project aims at developing a new learning framework that directly models a human?s natural language explanations to either provide a machine with labeling rationale or correct an observed erroneous rationale. The project will develop explanation-based learning methods that can capture the compositional nature of human natural language explanations, and study explanation-guided model refinement methods to update model parameters based on the provided human explanations regarding undesirable behaviors. To adapt to changing data distribution, this project will formulate a human-in-the-loop continual model refinement framework where problematic model behavioral patterns are automatically identified, and human feedback is solicited to correct the model.

Computational design of new materials has become increasingly viable with advances in computing power and methodologies. However, exploration of large chemical spaces with millions of compounds is still computationally intractable for ab-initio methods. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a means to accelerate such large explorations, but popular ML methods still have limitations in accuracy and interpretability. In this project, the research team will develop novel computational methods for materials design focused on the central idea that crystal properties are better modeled through interactions between motifs (groups of atoms) within a structure rather than between individual atoms. The team will apply this idea to design new Zintl phases, where the structural motifs strongly influence functional properties. Zintl phases are an under-explored class of compounds, presenting opportunities to discover and design new phases. The ultimate goal of this project is to discover Zintl phases with new compositions and structure types and learn relationships between their compositions, structural motifs, and functional properties that will allow inverse design of Zintl phases with tailored properties. The team will use chemical decorations and Lego-like assembly to ""construct"" Zintl phases and develop hierarchical graph representation algorithms to automatically learn the relationships between structural motifs and functional properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The number of students enrolled in and graduating from cybersecurity programs is not at a pace that can meet this growing demand. As a result, the nation will not have enough domestically trained cybersecurity technicians to satisfy the needs of industry, business, government, and other sectors. This project aims to addresses critical regional and national needs for skilled cybersecurity technicians.  It will do so by collaborating with the local education agency?s high school Career and Technical Education program, local businesses, and industries to increase the number of trained cybersecurity technicians who are ready for work. Program pathways will be created that allow students to earn credits toward a degree in applied science while completing an industry-recognized certificate in cybersecurity. Internships with local businesses and organizations will provide students with opportunities to put the skills they are learning in the classroom into real-world practice.<br/><br/>The goals of this project include: (1) producing skilled, highly qualified, and career-ready cybersecurity technicians; (2) equipping information technology faculty with the cybersecurity knowledge and skills required to effectively teach cybersecurity and optimize student learning and retention; (3) recruiting, retaining, and graduating individuals from communities that are underrepresented in cybersecurity, including women. Evaluation of the project will include both formative and summative assessment of the efficacy of the program in meeting the proposed goals and outcomes. The outcomes of this project have the potential to advance knowledge about challenges that students in a rural community face as learners in STEM fields, particularly in the information technology and cybersecurity fields.

The global threat to food security and the need to deal with unpredictable climate conditions have opened the doors to advanced precision agriculture and vertical urban farming. Rapidly growing global populations, demand for higher agricultural yields with limited arable farmland drive demand for vertical farming and new technologies to expand access to this method of sustainable crop cultivation. The proposed system will reduce the burden on the environment by decreasing water, fertilizers and pesticides required to grow crops. These micro-farms will boost agricultural profitability by providing a reliable, sustainable food system with fresh, healthy, and eco-friendly produce. This reduces food waste and the environmental impact of the food supply chain while improving yields and nutritional density.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project advances a system with integrated environmental control, consumables management, alerting, and scheduling. Furthermore, the automated controls are continuously improved by using camera vision to estimate yield and machine learning to forecast yield and optimize the environmental variables. To make the system cost-effective, a novel multispectral camera will be developed to collect agricultural data. Using machine learning, the images collected will be correlated to the environmental variables, such as pH and nutrient concentration, so that those variables can be optimized to increase yields. In order to improve scheduling and logistics, the platform will track inputs such as seeds, nutrients, and pH solution, using sensors and QR codes to automate consumable replacement.  Sensors and software checks will determine when component or human failure have occurred, before they lead to crop failure, leading to just-in-time component replacement and maintenance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important force in this change is the increase in hurricane frequency and intensity. In November of 2020, two hurricanes (Eta and Iota) moved from the Caribbean basin to across the Honduran mainland in quick succession. Each hurricane generated massive rainfall as it downgraded to a tropical storm and flooded the Sula Valley in north-central Honduras. Lake Yojoa, located in north central Honduras, the only natural lake in Honduras, has been home to human populations for > 4000 years, and as such, carries an important sense of place for many Hondurans. Addressing challenges of global freshwater sustainability requires an intimate understanding of ecosystems from across the globe. This RAPID will assess how the increasingly frequent massive rainfall events caused by the recent hurricanes impacts tropical aquatic ecosystems by altering the physical dynamics and water chemistry of tropical lakes and the watersheds that sustain them.<br/><br/>This RAPID represents a unique opportunity to close knowledge gaps at the intersection of three deficits in the current understanding of freshwater ecosystems. First, tropical lakes that experience stratification and mixus are understudied compared to their temperate counterparts. Second, lake ecosystems are rarely considered in the context of the watersheds within which they reside. Third, in order to fully understand the impact of global change on aquatic ecosystems, time-series data that can distinguish between intra-annual and inter-annual variability are necessary. This project addresses the impact of two large hurricanes on a monomictic tropical lake in Central America (Lake Yojoa) and its watershed. In doing so, it provides the opportunity to a) advance our understanding of the biogeochemistry of tropical monomictic lakes, b) identify key linkages between watershed-derived-allochthonous nutrient delivery and internal lake biogeochemical dynamics and c) identify the impact of hurricanes on tropical watersheds and the lakes they contain. By rapidly deploying a lake and watershed sampling design and comparing contemporary dynamics to analyses conducted previous to the hurricanes, this RAPID will advance our understanding of these important knowledge gaps within the context of the current understanding of tropical freshwater ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The purpose of this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to conduct a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the cascading impacts of the 2021 Texas Winter Storm on residents in eight metropolitan areas. Reliable assessment of household experiences is time-sensitive, and RAPID funding is enabling the collection of high quality, ephemeral data from affected households.

In the past, this heat source resulted in large-volume volcanic eruptions that created many of the rocks we see scattered across the landscape today. Because Yellowstone is a federally protected and active volcanic center, scientists have an obligation to understand the geologic history and possible hazards of such a massive volcanic system and to convey this information to the communities and people that visit each year. This project aims to systematically investigate the youngest supereruption, the Lava Creek Tuff, which produced the modern-day Yellowstone caldera. The questions to be addressed include: (1) how was magma positioned beneath the surface? (2) what may have triggered the magma to move to the surface? (3) where did magma erupt from? and (4) how long (days, weeks, years) did it take for all of these processes to occur? Throughout this project, the researchers will be training the next generation of geologists to develop their skills as scientists and communicators. Yellowstone provides an ideal setting to teach skills related to geologic mapping, critical thinking, and rock analysis, which is why this proposal is structured to provide eight undergraduate and three graduate students with summer mapping experiences, with an emphasis on recruiting students from underrepresented backgrounds. All students will be trained to be active stewards of Yellowstone science, writing blog articles and preparing presentations that communicate to the public the geology and monitoring of Yellowstone Volcano.<br/> <br/>The mechanisms and timescales by which large volumes of rhyolitic magma accumulate, are stored in the upper crust and are triggered to eruption remain fundamental questions in volcanology. The overall Research Objective of this proposal is to reevaluate the assemblage, storage and eruption dynamics of the youngest supereruption from the Yellowstone Volcanic Field (YVF), the Lava Creek Tuff (LCT; 0.63 Ma). This work was ignited by the 2018 discovery of two new ignimbrite units previously unrecognized (and currently spatially unconstrained) as belonging to the LCT. Additionally, hints of inter-depositional chemical variations within the LCT exist in the established literature but are currently poorly defined. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that the LCT eruption consisted of multiple magma bodies tapped differentially along the caldera boundary, comparable to what is inferred in the better-studied Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, the oldest (2.08 Ma) supereruption from the YVF. Through a combination of detailed field mapping, extensive whole rock, glass geochemistry and petrographic analysis, diffusion modeling and age dating, this project will rethink the makeup and progression of the youngest Yellowstone supereruption. The Educational Objective of this study is to leverage the proximity (1.5 hours) of Montana State University to one of the largest volcanic systems on Earth, using it as a field-based laboratory for training the next generation of geologists. This project presents numerous opportunities for practicing science communication in light of over 4 million tourists that visit the park each year.

As the coastal current transporting much of the fresh water on the shelf reaches the Cape, the strong wind forcing combined with its orientation with respect to the coastline curvature and complex bathymetry may flush water offshore there.  The project will deploy drifters and profiling floats, interpreted in the context of modeled circulation to investigate how this high volume freshwater may enter the open ocean. Prior studies have indicated the potential influence this exported shelf water may have on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and hence global climate. The project will support the career development of an observational young investigator, a project-specific website will be developed, an undergraduate summer student fellow will help analyze the data, and a volunteer undergraduate student will participate in a research cruise. This work will clarify how shelf-derived fresh water at high latitudes can influence the large-scale ocean circulation, and should be applicable to other regions where buoyant coastal currents veer around sharp bathymetry. Broader relevance will include addressing where and how meltwater may affect the North Atlantic spring bloom through its supply of micronutrients and stratification of the subpolar North Atlantic.<br/><br/><br/>The current melting of the Arctic and the Greenland Ice Sheet introduces enough fresh water into the subpolar North Atlantic to significantly alter the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, but where and how this water leaves the shelf ocean to interact with the boundary currents and deep basins of the subpolar North Atlantic is poorly constrained. This project will use a joint observational and modeling study to explore the pathways and fate of fresh water around Cape Farewell, and to determine the forcing mechanisms that drive the fluxes. Surface drifters and rapidly-profiling Argo floats will be deployed along the southeast Greenland shelf in 2021 and 2022 to assess the along-stream, cross-stream, and vertical coherency of the coastal current. The modeling component will seed a high-resolution (~2 km lateral grid spacing) year-long run of the MITgcm with virtual floats in the coastal current to follow their pathways around Cape Farewell, complemented by an examination of model circulation response to internal instabilities and external forcing, and quantification of the resulting modeled shelf-basin exchange. This work will provide the first comprehensive study of the shelf-basin exchange around Cape Farewell, a process often invoked to explain North Atlantic variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the predominant conception of scientific literacy has focused on individuals, and there is not consensus as to what community level scientific literacy is or how to measure it. Thus, a 2016 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, ?Science Literacy: Concepts, Contexts, and Consequences,? stated that community level scientific literacy is undertheorized and understudied. More specifically, the committee recommended that research is needed to understand both the i) contexts (e.g., a community?s physical and social setting) and ii) features of community organization (e.g., relationships within the community) that support community level science literacy and influence successful group action. This CAREER award responds to this nationally identified need by iteratively refining a model to conceptualize and measure community level scientific literacy. The model and metrics developed in this project may be applied to a wide range of topics (e.g., vaccination, pandemic response, genetically-modified foods, pollution control, and land-use decisions) to improve a community?s capacity to make scientifically-sound collective decisions. This CAREER award is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) and the EHR CORE Research (ECR) programs. It supports the AISL program goals to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. It supports the ECR program goal to advance relevant research knowledge pertaining to STEM learning and learning environments. <br/><br/>The proposed research will conceptualize, operationalize, and measure community level scientific literacy. This project will use a comparative multiple case study research design. Three coastal communities, faced with the need to make scientifically-informed land-use decisions, will be studied sequentially. A convergent mixed methods design will be employed, in which qualitative and quantitative data collection and analyses are performed concurrently. To describe the i) context of each community case, this project will use qualitative research methods, including document analysis, observation, focus groups, and interviews. To measure the ii) features of community organization for each community case, social network analysis will be used. The results from this research will be disseminated throughout and at the culmination of the project through professional publications and conference presentations as well as with community stakeholders and the general public. The integrated education activities include a professional learning certificate for informal science education professionals and STEM graduate students. This certificate emphasizes high-quality community-engaged scholarship, placing students with partners such as museums, farmer?s markets, and libraries, to offer informal learning programs in their communities. This professional learning program will be tested as a model to provide training for STEM graduate students who would like to communicate their research to the public through outreach and extension activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conjugated polymers are a unique class of non-metallic polymers with semiconducting properties resembling that of the chemical element silicon.  They are extensively used in solar cells, LED screens and other applications that utilize the conversion of electricity to light.  Ladder polymers, on the other hand, are a type of double stranded polymers with the connectivity of a ladder.  They are prepared by interconnecting repeating units along the main polymer chain by four chemical bonds, instead of the two bonds typically seen in conventional plastics.  In this research, structural features of luminescent building blocks will first be optimized using a combination of synthetic and computational techniques.  Ladder polymers will then be constructed, and their physical properties systematically studied using a variety of analytical techniques.  A strong emphasis will be placed on development of materials that can more efficiently interconvert electricity and light.  This work has the potential to lead to expansion of knowledge in organic semiconducting molecules, syntheses and polymers.  Materials prepared in this work are also expected to impact development of more efficient digital displays and optical interconnectors.

The second single-step approach will consist of ?ladderization? to simultaneously form the fused ring structures and will be accomplished by utilizing Friedlander condensation reaction.  Polymerization of these monomers and oligomers will yield conjugated polymers with well-defined structures and optimized properties.  Detailed characterization of the prepared polymers will also be performed using a variety of analytical techniques and will provide the necessary information for the structure-property correlation and shade light into the aggregation state of these luminescent polymers.  The foldable semi-ladder conjugated polymers that will be synthesized as a result of this work can potentially address the big challenge confronted in the OLET (organic light-emitting transistors), by facilitating the fast charge transport while avoiding tight intermolecular H-aggregation that quenches luminescence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed project brings forestry within the scope of the emerging science of genome editing with powerful impacts. Enhanced traits allow commercial entities in pulp and paper manufacturing to save energy and chemical costs; a pulp and paper facility can potentially reduce costs by up to 6%, exceptional for an industry that provides everyday items, such as hygienic tissue and cardboard for deliveries, at thin profit margins. Furthermore, trees play an important role in carbon sequestration, but they need to survive the temperature changes and potential infestations. With the advance of the proposed technology, editing forests could eventually gain acceptance as a significant avenue to bioresource sustainability and carbon sequestration.<br/><br/>The proposed project combines the insights of tree genetics with the power of genome editing to generate enhanced genotypes with functional attributes that improve tree growth, processing and sustainability. Based on an integrated predictive model of genes responsible for phenotypes of commercial interest in relevant species, it is possible to select combinations of genome editing targets responsible for enhanced phenotypes, such as lignin content and syringyl/guaiacyl ratio, to modulate the composition of trees as to increase their propensity for processing, their environmental resilience, or valuable commercial features. Using CRISPR-based genome editing technologies, the project will multiplex target these genetic sequences concurrently to generate the intended genetic alteration combinations, using expertise in delivery to commercially relevant elite germplasm. Conventional breeding in forestry is slow and cumbersome because the long generation time of trees requires decades per breeding cycle. No alternative technology is currently feasible for accelerated genetic improvement of forest trees. With the proposed technology, annual crops can be efficiently bred on biannual or annual cycles with the same or improved properties as their conventionally-bred counterparts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gas/liquid systems with steep property changes consisting of plasma, gas, and liquid have incredible promise for many applications ranging from water cleaning to agriculture applications and plasma-activated liquids for medical use. Although much progress has been made in understanding plasma-liquid interactions - including the development of the first upscaled devices for the degradation of fluorinated organic compounds known as ""forever molecules"" - to date there have been only a few detailed investigations on plasma breakdown mechanisms in the multiphase plasma-bubble-liquid system.  The multiphase system itself and the electrical breakdown mechanisms in such systems are not well understood, hampering efficient use of plasma-bubble-liquid systems.  Exploration of such systems conducted within this project will benefit society, potentially leading to new emerging applications to solve problems like groundwater contamination, bacterial contamination of hospital wastewater, providing fertilizer on-farm, and reducing the amount of water needed for irrigation in times when water is becoming increasingly precious.<br/><br/>Although extensive research has been performed on plasma-liquid interactions, this multidisciplinary topic still challenges the scientific community. The introduction of gas bubbles is of great interest because it opens another degree of freedom in this multiphase system that influences the plasma behavior. Furthermore, bubbles are ubiquitous in liquids, and additional bubbles can be produced throughout the liquid by energy transport at the plasma-liquid interface. Thus, the behavior of bubbles and the impact of bubbles on the formation of plasma are of great interest for the whole plasma-liquid scientific community.  This project addresses the critical need for developing a fundamental quantitative understanding of the bubble ? from bubble formation, the interaction of the gas bubbles with the electric field, plasma interaction, to its impact on the electrical breakdown by combining multiphase modeling and experiments. Interface instabilities after electrical breakdown have been observed in previous research, but no fundamental explanation for this behavior has been found. The multiphase plasma-bubble-liquid simulations will comprehensively address this complex system. This project will explore the electrical breakdown in the multiphase plasma-bubble-liquid system, correlate the bubble properties to electrical breakdown conditions, and explore the gas/liquid interface instabilities after electrical breakdown. The combination of experiments and simulations will enable fundamental understanding of the breakdown and instabilities in the multiphase plasma-bubble-liquid system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, global supply chains possess enormous potential to contribute to sustainable development around the world.  Yet, they continue to be plagued by persistent social and environmental responsibility violations, such as child and/or forced labor, hazardous working environments, excessive overtime, poor wages, and pollution. These violations not only pose societal burdens but can also create significant economic inefficiencies for firms in the forms of product recalls, fines, problem corrections, supply interruptions, stock value loss, and brand damage. To make a compelling business case for sustainable supply chains and eventually create them, firms must quantify the financial impacts of the responsibility violations of their suppliers, gain greater visibility into the responsibility-related risks of their suppliers for a more effective allocation of inspection resources, and implement appropriate decision support tools for managers to account for responsibility-related risks in sourcing decisions. The objective of this research is to couple data-analytics approaches with the newly available datasets on social and/or environmental violations of suppliers to generate the knowledge base needed for firms to move in this direction. This research develops descriptive and predictive statistical models, and behavioral decision support tools that can be deployed by firms to proactively manage responsibility in their supply chains.<br/><br/>This research bridges an important methodology gap in supply chain management by utilizing data-driven approaches for managing supplier responsibility. First, this research utilizes machine learning and language processing approaches to (1) link public supplier environmental violation records with proprietary supply network data, and (2) enable a systematic quantitative evaluation of how suppliers? responsibility violations affect the financial performance of buying firms for the first time. Second, statistical models are developed to detect key common characteristics of suppliers that are revealed as environmental violators and to predict ?risky? suppliers. These models will enable buying firms, governmental and/or nongovernmental agencies to allocate limited inspection resources according to predicted risk to achieve cost-effectiveness. Third, behavioral mechanisms are designed and tested through a closed-loop experimental methodology to nudge managers into considering responsibility-related risks in sourcing decisions. Taken together, this research facilitates a shift from ?reactive? to ?proactive? in the way firms view and manage social and environmental responsibility in their supply chains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Infectious diseases alter the United State's economy, society, and culture in complex ways, and these economic and social changes influence the way a pandemic develops. For example, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic is having substantial economic, educational, social, and societal consequences, including changes in work and housing habits, labor markets, and social justice dialogues. Similarly, the HIV epidemic had a major impact on our society in the 1980's, far beyond those immediately impacted by the virus. Mathematical models help make sense of these complex interactions. Constructing models of such complex socio-economic-epidemiological systems requires experts from the constituent fields to work together. The PIs anticipate the research agenda developed in the workshop will facilitate the research communities to discover new mathematical methods and modeling approaches to jointly forecast epidemiological, economic and social patterns so that future pandemics are mitigated with lower social and economic cost.<br/><br/>The conventional approach to the modelling of infectious diseases is to collect basic life-cycle data on the disease, and to overlay that onto structured population data to predict prevalence patterns, health outcomes, using differential equations, networks, agent-based simulations, or another related modelling approaches. These approaches are quite successful at day-ahead prediction, but aside from largely ad hoc parametric adjustments, these standard approaches have almost no ability to connect to behavioral based interventions. These means that the models are not helpful for measuring the benefits and costs (broadly defined) of non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are critical when novel pathogens emerge.  There is expert knowledge and modeling work, related to epidemics, in economics and social sciences that can be used to better describe transmission, while providing internally consistent connections to society and the economy. But the disciplinary divides are difficult to bridge. There are limits in data collection, including scale, precision, and representativeness. This difficulty has been amplified by the fast growth of the scholarly literature over the last few years. Bringing together a diverse group of scholars, scientists, and modelers will help everybody interested in the field better understand what has been accomplished so far and produce a research agenda for improving mathematical models in human epidemiology in the future.

The research will model new mechanisms of positive feedback in a range of settings, validate these results using data from public agencies and private firms, and leverage this information for improved control of pooled transportation systems. The knowledge obtained can be used to develop and refine pricing, taxation, and other policy strategies that can both promote pooling and reduce urban traffic congestion. Improving carpool options can also improve environmental outcomes, by reducing vehicle travel, and social equity, by providing reasonable travel times to those who cannot buy or drive a car but who do not live close to convenient transit options. The education and outreach plan includes recruiting students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to work on the research tasks and provide them with opportunities to mentor junior colleagues on research activities. The research will develop interactive web modules to describe these carpooling behaviors to a wide audience. <br/><br/>The research will specifically focus on two mechanisms of positive feedback in carpooling. The first is hyperdemand, whereby the share of people choosing to carpool both depends on and affects traffic congestion. The second are matching externalities, whereby the quality of matches among carpoolers increases as more choose to carpool. The research will break new ground by bringing to bear tools from dynamical systems, search/matching theory and network-level traffic relations to build a robust theory of carpooling.  To validate the theory, the research team will use empirical data collected from open data sources, as well as our industry partners. In addition, case studies of real policies to promote carpooling will inform the research and provide an evidence base for future work. The research activities will provide a new paradigm for modeling carpooling services and ride-hailing systems that will have significant impacts for the next generation of urban transportation systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This species alone fixes approximately as much carbon dioxide annually as global croplands. Understanding the link between the diverse genes of Prochlorococcus and its central role in ocean metabolism is hindered by our inability to modify its genes to test various hypotheses. Building on recent progress, this project aims to develop two distinct but parallel approaches to the challenge. In the first, barriers to the introduction of foreign DNA to Prochlorococcus will be bypassed by exploiting a system of newly discovered genetic elements that are found in some Prochlorococcus strains. In the second, approaches to trigger mechanisms that allow cells to take up and integrate new genes into their cellular machinery will be developed. Once developed, these approaches would allow better understanding of the link between Prochlorococcus genes and the ocean environment, which is critical for characterizing the role ocean processes play in regulating the global carbon cycle. These advances will also provide a blueprint for the development of similar methodologies for studying other microbial organisms. Finally, developing these technologies is a critical first step in enabling Prochlorococcus as a potential chassis for artificial photosynthesis. Since it has the smallest genome of any photosynthetic cell, Prochlorococcus is already the most basic photosynthetic machine occurring in nature, making it the ideal candidate for developing the tools that would enable bioengineering. The tools this project aims to develop would provide immense potential for new inquiry and biotechnology applications. This project provides support for graduate students, a postdoctoral research associate, and two technicians.  <br/><br/>Over the past three decades, the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, notable for its numerical dominance of the oceans and enormous genetic diversity, has been developed as a model organism for cross-scale systems biology. While each cell has around 2000 genes, the total unique gene content of the global Prochlorococcus ?collective? likely exceeds 80,000 genes, most of which have unknown function. Thus, despite their central role in ocean metabolism, the relationship between Prochlorococcus? diverse genetic content, and the selective pressures that have shaped it, is only beginning to be understood. Progress on this challenge has been stalled by the lack of a genetic system. In previous work supported by the EDGE program, the researchers developed a method of introducing exogenous DNA into Prochlorococcus cells, which represented a significant step forward in genomic manipulation. In the process, a system of mobile genetic elements was discovered, which represent a promising new tool for integration of exogenous DNA into the Prochlorococcus, electroporation delivered tycheposons that are constructed with native genetic elements. A second approach to be developed utilizes a novel transposon-based screen to identify conditions for triggering natural competence activity among Prochlorococcus and will result in a genome-wide map of promising integration sites. Both approaches have the advantage of utilizing DNA from Prochlorococcus itself, which should more effectively bypass cell defenses against exogenous DNA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond common geometry that can be fabricated using conventional lithography techniques, the unique innovation of this project is the use of two-photon polymerization to fabricate particles of complex shapes, which enable tunable in-plane and out-of-plane periodicities and out-of-plane protrusions in the self-assembly of micro-patterned surfaces. The studied self-assembled textured surfaces can potentially be programmed and achieve controllable wettability or be used as coatings, especially attractive for curved and/or delicate substrates in applications such as organic photovoltaics and wearable sensors. The educational activities consist of developing and implementing a particle self-assembly learning module for elementary school students, hosting a student, via summer internship, from a local Hispanic community college, and incorporating the topic of self-assembly into a graduate course on defects in crystalline solids.<br/><br/>Using a three-dimensional printing technology, namely, two-photon polymerization, this project will fabricate micro-scaled particles for self-assembly into textured surfaces. Arrays on the order of 200,000 particles will be printed on a solid substrate, transferred to a liquid-filled well, and then self-assembled through a balance of sedimentation, diffusion, interparticle and particle-substrate interactions. Particles of different geometries will be investigated including tetrahedrons and square pyramids of varying sized as well as binary particle systems, to obtain a tunable feature height and periodicity formed at a millimeter scale. An optical microscope will be utilized to acquire video images of particle motions along the self-assembling time with automated image analyses to evaluate the quality of the self-assembled surface. The bond and body order parameters will be analyzed to understand the degree of uniformity that can be achieved under different processing conditions, and the types of defects generated during such a self-assembly process. Theoretical studies will include the Brownian motion modeled using the Einstein-Stokes equation and the energetic driving force modeled using the DLVO principle to design self-assembly experiments that are likely to succeed, and then compared against experimental results to gain new knowledge of what governs the self-assembly mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there are plenty of publicly available AI approaches to cybersecurity, successful use depends on users? technical and soft skills. Moreover, AI-based approaches have been intensely scrutinized with respect to their security and ethics, delaying deployment. AI itself can be attacked and there can also be issues with discrimination in AI-based classification.  Thus, for AI to be effectively and quickly adopted for cybersecurity, AI security and ethics need to be assured. Training cybersecurity professionals to understand how to effectively use AI for cybersecurity and to be aware of AI security and ethics issues is critical for effective design and deployment of AI-based cybersecurity solutions. Future cybersecurity professionals must also be able effectively to communicate relevant information related to AI-based security mechanisms and policies to a variety of stakeholders.  This project will design competency-driven educational activities focusing on AI techniques for cybersecurity that will increase the effective and ethical application of AI-enhanced cybersecurity. <br/><br/>The project?s educational approach is based on four interrelated pillars. The first pillar focuses on educational activities covering a systematic AI-powered approach to cybersecurity, based on defender and attacker perspectives. The second pillar focuses on educational activities covering a systematic analysis of categories of AI attack and corresponding mitigation techniques. The third and fourth pillars focus on AI ethics and approaches to cybersecurity communications, respectively. A combination of social, philosophical, and technical perspectives will create a unique approach to cybersecurity communication. Together, the pillars provide a systematic perspective of AI-powered cybersecurity. They provide both foundational and technical competencies related to AI ethics and cybersecurity communication that benefit multiple stakeholders, from students and educators to employers and regulators. An important goal of the project is to make sure that students and educators understand that cybersecurity, including AI-based defense techniques, requires deployment of different types of defense approaches.

In the life sciences, an increasingly popular method is to combine high resolution structural information (context) with super-resolution fluorescence images of key marked proteins to obtain functional understanding of the tissue. The user does not need to worry about position tracking and alignment. Furthermore, the architecture lends itself well to a new optical charge control method for mitigating charge build-up on the sample, a problem common to electron microscopy. The same optical path used for imaging allows co-illumination of the sample by the charge control beam. Ahead of submission of the proposal, the team completed detailed particles optics modeling and system design optimization. This Phase I project will complete the mechanical design of the microscope, build the prototype, and validate the particle optic modeling and resulting imaging performance using standard electron imaging metrology targets.

Current technologies for responding to large wildfires do not typically achieve direct extinguishment and are rather aimed at the gradual guidance and containment of fires - in the era of regular megafires (greater than 100,000 acres), methods such as aerial drops are rarely effective despite their enormous expense. As populations have further expanded into the urban-wildland interface, environmental change has produced extended droughts and weakened forests, and fuel loads have accumulated for far longer than would be natural, fire seasons now approach perennial levels. As a result, Federal annual spending on emergency suppression now regularly reaches $2B to $3B, up from an average of less than $1B at the end of the 20th century, and the holistic economic impact of a bad fire season may cost the broader economy an order of magnitude more in lost Gross Domestic Product.  The proposed project implements a cost-effective, rapid-response shock wave technology to extinguish large fire fronts. <br/> <br/>This project involves technical innovation in the novel application of controlled, directed shock waves to uncontrolled wildfire-scale flames fueled by organic material, with the goal of achieving rapid extinguishment. Characterization of turbulent flame and debris field response to a multitude of variables which are important for field deployment will result from testing with a physical prototype device ? this device features novel mechanisms for the safe, repeated delivery of tunable shock waves. The unique data generated will in turn enable the optimization and refinement of a portable product that can eventually proceed to industrial application with firefighting agencies. The project work comprises detailed design, fabrication, and experimental testing of the shock-generating device at appropriate scale using high speed videography with density-based visualization. This will be combined with high-frequency pressure and temperature sensing, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique and further improve understanding of the underlying fluid and fire dynamics as the shock wave interactions occur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A significant need for this technology exists in the competition horse market. 98% of competitive horses suffer from soft tissue injuries and more than 80% develop suspensory ligament defects. Injuries to suspensory ligaments can take years to heal and are the leading cause of missed performances owners. The proposed technology provides veterinarians a means of healing suspensory ligament injuries significantly faster, resulting in fewer missed performances, reduced financial losses, and most importantly, improved quality of life for the animal. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will address the problem of slow healing suspensory ligament injuries for racehorses. 98% of vets use stem cell injections to aid in recovery of these injuries, but this strategy has limited efficacy due to poor viability of injected cells and short cell retention times at the site of injury. This problem is addressed by developing technology to preserve and localize mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) at an injury site through delivery in inert, injectable hydrogel microparticles. The research objectives of this proposal are twofold; 1. Quantitively assessing metrics of cell viability and stromal cell-like behavior of hydrogel microencapsulated cells and compare them to baseline unencapsulated cell metrics, and 2. Provide explicit evidence that the encapsulation process localizes cells and preserves their viability, is nontoxic and non-immunogenic, and demonstrates markers of superior tissue regeneration in a small animal model similar to that of its intended commercial use.

The modular joint technology has the potential to replace ageing infrastructure and to reconstruct bridges damaged by disasters, with a focus on 100-400 ft. bridges. Of the 67,824 existing 100-400 ft. span bridges in the U.S., 23% are structurally deficient or beyond the typical design life. Further, disasters often destroy bridges, preventing effective evacuation efforts and leaving displaced populations without access to food, water, or medical aid. To reduce mortality and morbidity rates following disasters and to expedite economic recovery, there is an urgent need to reconstruct damaged bridges. In addition to addressing these needs, this project will support the education of two graduate students in entrepreneurship and innovation, including research and coursework leading to graduate degrees in Civil Engineering, coursework in entrepreneurship leading to a Certificate, participation in I-Corps, and internships. Broadening participation of underrepresented groups will be achieved through research opportunities and an annual, ?INVITE: InNoVatIon, Technology, and business in Engineering? workshop for undergraduate students from multiple institutions.<br/><br/>The proposed project will advance the modular joint technology for commercialization. The modular joint technology is a paradigm change in design: the connection is the module and the members are standard steel sections. The technology harnesses the benefits of modularity (cost/time savings through mass-production) and trusses (high efficiency, ease of design, longevity), while overcoming the deficiencies of existing modular bridges (limited spans, unreliable pin connections) and conventional trusses (high fabrication cost, difficult construction, lack of safety). Specifically, the modular joint is comprised of a weldment/built-up section of webs and flanges that includes a starter segment to connect to members or other modular joints. Flanges and webs are connected independently through bolted splice connections, forming a moment-resisting connection that provides the potential for the structure to tolerate member loss. The proposed translational research will address the remaining technical challenges for commercialization: fabrication, construction, and safety. Research objectives include: (1) identifying parameters for minimum fabrication cost while meeting structural performance criteria, (2) investigating construction procedures and fit-up strategies, (3) evaluating behavior under member loss and fatigue load cases, and (4) developing design details and guidelines.

Yet, AI components are also vulnerable to attacks, and require development of techniques to make them more robust. This collaborative project between the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) and the University of Illinois addresses the research and educational aspects of combining AI and cybersecurity. Educational and training materials will be developed for use by college and university instructors and students and by cybersecurity and AI professionals. These materials will address how AI can improve security systems and how cybersecurity analytics can protect AI systems. In addition, the project will recruit students from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in computing. <br/><br/>This project has three interrelated topics. The first focuses on education and extends the project team?s existing cybersecurity concept inventory to include relevant AI-related concepts. Student knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity and AI relatedness will be assessed before and after taking AI or cybersecurity courses.  Educational materials and projects  will also be created to demonstrate  how AI can be applied to cybersecurity problems and how cybersecurity tools can protect AI systems from attack. The second topic explores how the latest AI tools can support cybersecurity tasks. The creation and maintenance of semantic knowledge graphs of cyberthreat information will be studied and used to support reinforcement learning systems that are better at detecting the presence of malware in a host. The third topic focuses on finding new ways that cybersecurity tools can protect AI systems from becoming compromised by attacks such as data poisoning. Cyberthreat knowledge graphs and neural networks will be used to detect and eliminate likely disinformation from data used to train AI-based cybersecurity systems. This aspect of the project has applications beyond cybersecurity, such as countering disinformation. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

Decreasing the total PV module cost will improve access to solar cells, through which the overall consumption of fossil fuels could be reduced. Moreover, since this novel technology is zero direct GHG emission, replacing the current manufacturing processes with our new technology can positively affect the environment directly and immediately.

This process utilizes a state-of-the-art molten salt composition with a new mechanism for suppressing dendrite formation and salt trapping. This process can potentially produce silicon with 4-5N purity at $1.70/kg using <30 kWh/kg, with pure oxygen by-product and zero direct Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The 4-5N product purity would be sufficient for directional solidification or direct boule/wafer production, resulting in $2.20-2.70/kg solar-grade silicon cost, i.e., 75-80% lower than today. This purity through the novel process is achievable via electrochemical selection, an inert anode to avoid carbon anode contamination, and low impurity solubility in the solid silicon product.

The proposed technology can reduce wildfire risk by cleaning up the forest undergrowth. Landfills in many states will be reaching maximum capacity in coming years and are under threat of being shut down: diverting landfill waste to the production of valuable products is much desired. Besides municipal waste, it is also possible to reduce the burning of agricultural waste by converting these waste streams into valuable outputs, such as biofuels and biochar for use in applications including concrete and water filtration.

This is a critical area of investigation because signal-dependent coordination of cell behavior is essential for the growth of all life forms. Signaling also plays a crucial role in dividing stem cells,  ensuring that the proper number of stem cells are available to participate in tissue renewal and repair. Additionally, errors in signaling are the primary cause of cancer. Because cancer also entails unregulated cell division, it is particularly important to understand how division may exacerbate signaling errors. To explore this fundamentally important question, this collaborative research project encompasses three institutions, Princeton University, Swarthmore College and Colby College. The combined expertise will enable comprehensive investigations of signaling in dividing cells using an array of organisms, along with cutting edge genetic manipulation and imaging technologies. Additionally, this collaboration will pursue an ambitious outreach program which will include ? 1) providing enriching research experiences for a diverse group of undergraduates, 2) development of a class focused on cancer biology for elementary school students in an underserved school district as part of the established Science for Kids summer program at Swarthmore College, 3) integration between Summer Scholars Programs at Colby, Princeton and Swarthmore which focus on preparing URM and other diverse students for a successful college transition and 4) teacher-training opportunities at the Colby Center for Teaching and Learning for Princeton post-docs who will be teaching courses in the Colby January Term program.<br/><br/>Cellular trafficking of receptors and associated membrane proteins can profoundly impact cell signaling. Due to the long-held assumption that membrane trafficking is shut down during mitosis, current research has not addressed fundamental questions regarding the nature and regulation of trafficking in dividing cells. In particular, the contributions of mitotic kinases to endocytic trafficking remain poorly characterized. Additionally, the roles of specific endocytic pathways have not been delineated. This project aims to fill these critical gaps through a collaborative effort incorporating two experimental systems in which prior research has demonstrated an essential role for mitotic trafficking: polarization of mammalian epidermal cells and induction of heart progenitor cells in the basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis. It will investigate two hypotheses; 1) Cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) suppresses lysosomal degradation in a cargo-specific manner. 2) CDK1 and Aurora Kinase (AurK) suppress recycling broadly during mitosis. These hypotheses will be examined with well-established methods that disrupt specific mitotic kinases and endocytic pathways and employ high-resolution live-imaging assays to visualize the impact on receptor trafficking in both model systems. By conducting these studies on a range of cargo proteins in two highly divergent cell types, these findings will provide insights into the impact of mitotic trafficking on ? 1) fate decisions in developing embryos 2) re-establishment of polarity in dividing epithelial sheets and 3) signal dependent behaviors of stem cells or differentiated lineages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many high-stake decisions such as grant funding or candidate hiring involve peer review panels. In these panels, qualified individual reviewers provide their opinion on grant proposals or job candidates via a predefined process. Despite a potential plurality of opinions among panel members for a single application, the panel-level outcome of peer review often is a single number, such as the average of reviewers' scores. This project will systematically study existing methods for aggregating individual opinions into panel-level decisions. It also will develop a set of tools to communicate panel decision-making information to stakeholders. The tools to be developed will make the panel decision-making process more transparent. Stakeholders will be able to identify applications where there is less consensus and more uncertainty, potentially having direct impact on biases in human judgements. The project will refine the new tools with real data collected from various peer review processes.<br/><br/>This research project will develop new methodologies to model and represent uncertainty and robustness in panel consensus, whether around one dominant ranking of applications or as divergent opinions that provide different rankings depending on the latent opinion group. A decision support system called Improving Panel Consensus Tool or ImPaCT will be developed. ImPaCT will present the information and opinions from panel review via a set of visualization tools that can display score and relative order between applications, indicate which applications are comparable, and, if desired, assign importance weights to reviewers to determine if that changes the outcome. ImPaCT could be used as an analysis tool for understanding and summarizing reviewers' scientific merit assessments for stakeholders such as funding agencies and program officials or as an interactive tool for assisting panel members with making panel-level scientific merit decisions. ImPaCT will present a synopsis of the task, flag issues needing extra attention (ties, lack of consensus, or robustness) and offer the relevant information for the current sub-task (e.g., submission under discussion). By providing a synopsis of reviewers' assessments in real time, this tool will help keep in check what could otherwise be the undue salience of the loudest voices as well as the undue influence of anchoring, selective memory, and other cognitive biases on individual judgment in the aggregation of complex information under uncertainty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As numerous Texas counties faced record low temperatures, the independent electric grid for Texas nearly experienced a total collapse and more than 5 million people lost access to electricity. The cascading effects of this disaster included water service disruptions, boil-water advisories, communication and transportation disruptions, food shortages, and residential dislocation with implications for COVID-19 transmission and treatment. The purpose of this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to conduct a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the cascading impacts of the 2021 Texas Winter Storm on residents in eight metropolitan areas. Reliable assessment of household experiences is time-sensitive, and RAPID funding is enabling the collection of high quality, ephemeral data from affected households. The project will advance academic, practitioner, and public knowledge regarding factors influencing societal vulnerability to cascading disaster impacts during a pandemic which will be foundational to future efforts that seek to enhance resilience to such events nationwide. The project team will disseminate findings via multiple outlets, including by publishing articles in top-tier journals and delivering webinars to relevant stakeholder audiences. Additionally, findings will be shared via a website providing stakeholders, researchers, educators and other stakeholders with access to information about adverse impacts of the 2021 Texas Winter Storm. Through these channels, the project will extend societal benefits beyond the academic community.<br/><br/>This project applies a social vulnerability to disasters perspective to the 2021 Texas Winter Storm to advance knowledge of the socially uneven impacts of cascading disasters, and the disaster vulnerabilities experienced by subsidized rental housing residents.

These new methods offer potentially greener and more economical alternatives for manufacturing intermediates and target molecules for numerous applications ranging from agriculture, medicine, molecular electronics all the way to 21st century materials. The new molecular transformations exploit weak nitrogen-oxygen (N?O) bonds, which when ruptured, initiate carefully orchestrated sequences of chemical reactions, also known as domino reactions. The domino processes cause the skeletons of the original molecules to rearrange into completely new ones. These types of molecular rearrangement reactions are among the most efficient and atom-economical processes known to chemistry. Prof. Kürti has been a faculty sponsor of the Rice University chapter of Fun with Chemistry, an outreach program that has the short-term goal of establishing a robust Houston-area satellite program. The long-term goal is to initiate similar satellite programs in other major Texas metropolitan areas. This outreach program provides K-12 students in Texas with the opportunity to participate in experimental-learning through captivating science experiments. Curiosity for science is piqued through fun demonstrations that highlight important educational lessons by utilizing a variety of role models. In particular, this educational program strives to reach traditionally underrepresented minorities and highlight that anyone can be a scientist! The ultimate goal of the program is to inspire young students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-fields.<br/><br/>Professor Kürti?s research group will be exploring four fundamentally new domino reaction strategies to produce small-ring- and aromatic heterocycles. The common theme of these transformations is the nature of the activation of the substrates or intermediates: by a scission of their weak N?O bonds. Depending on the strategy, this N?O bond cleavage either triggers or drives the particular transformation, which include new ring-contractions and [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements. Making highly-substituted nitrogen-containing molecules is a long-standing challenge in synthetic organic chemistry. The proposed project aims to address this challenge: the driving force offered by cleaving N?O bonds enables the operationally simple construction of numerous challenging nitrogen-containing molecules, including ones currently unknown to chemistry. The proposed research promises to offer new, reliable, transition metal-free synthetic methods as alternatives to traditional approaches, and is expected to have impact on chemists in academic, governmental and industrial laboratories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, mathematical modeling can help determine the speed at which an infectious disease will spread, how interventions can limit the spread, and how sea level change can impact coastal populations and ecosystems. While educators and policymakers recognize the importance of mathematical modeling in K-12 education, the complexities of modeling and modeling tasks often create barriers for classroom implementation. Such tasks are complex, open-ended, and require iterative thinking and the coordination of multiple mathematical representations. This three-year Design and Development project seeks to build a semi-structured workplace to support students' mathematical modeling competencies called M2Studio. This technology integrates aspects of two existing and widely used technologies (CODAP and SageModeler) into a single workspace that can effectively capture students' activities, representations, problem solving sequences, and thinking as they work individually or in pairs on mathematical modeling tasks. The project will develop aspects of M2Studio across five design cycles, study student engagement and learning via the platform, and collect data from teachers on the conditions under which M2Studio implementation is particularly effective. <br/><br/>The project builds on a theoretical conceptualization of mathematical modeling that involves five sub competencies: simplifying, mathematizing, working mathematically, interpreting, and validating. In building the M2Studio and dynamically linking the CODAP and SageModeler, the system will provide opportunities to be able to assess the ways in which students are engaging in these sub competencies. The project will engage in five design cycles to design the technology and associated curricular modules, deploy and test the technologies with students and teachers, and assess the impact on students' mathematical modeling competencies. The first two design cycles will focus on technology development and short in-person lab tests with 4 teachers and 16 students. Design Cycles 3 and 4 will involve two field tests with 8 teachers and 400 students. The fifth design cycle will involve an implementation study to further explore the research questions.  Student learning will be assessed via a mathematical modeling sub-competencies test. Student interaction patterns will be evaluated through the qualitative analysis of screencast and classroom videos. The conditions under which the program is more or less effective with respect to classroom implementation will be measured by observations, interviews, and logs from implementing teachers. The final version of the platform will be hosted and made available widely in various K-16 mathematical modeling communities.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. While STEM-based models in linguistics and speech-hearing-communication sciences aim to provide explanations that apply across languages and socio-cultural and ethnic groups, the bulk of research is still conducted on Mainstream American English and other majority languages. Moreover, research in the language sciences is largely conducted by professionals from majority language communities. This is problematic for two reasons: findings are not representative of the increasingly diverse US population and neither are researchers, clinicians and educators. This 26-week Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program addresses these two issues by equipping 18 undergraduate students per year from under-represented communities with both transferable STEM-based skills and knowledge specific to language sciences that will ensure student success in graduate programs focused on speech, language and communication sciences and in working with members of minoritized linguistic communities. The program will include six modules: (A) Establishment of a community of scholars, (B) Research ethics training, (C) Mentored scientific research, (D) Research dissemination, (E) Participation in workshops to prepare a graduate school application portfolio and promote well-being in graduate school, (F) Organization of a program translational conference. <br/><br/>Recruiting students who use lesser-studied languages and non-mainstream varieties of English, and having them conduct research with Mentoring Faculty who are experts in the various sub-fields of linguistics and speech-language-communication sciences (Theoretical Linguistics, Computational Linguistics, First and Second Language Acquisition and Processing, Bilingualism, Speech, Language-Hearing and Communication Sciences, Developmental and Acquired Disorders) and have a research track record that reflects their commitments to excellence and diversity, constitutes an important step toward redressing the current imbalance in the field and ensuring that the student projects will benefit from the scholarly study of the linguistic and cultural diversity found in New York City.  The program will benefit from the tremendous ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of New York, in both the recruitment of student participants as well as project participants, and the mentors' state-of-the-art research facilities that include Molloy Speech Perception, Speech Production, Language Intervention and Processing and Brain Bases of Communication Laboratories, Brooklyn College Linguistics and Sociolinguistics Laboratories, CUNY Graduate Center Developmental Neurolinguistics Laboratory, LIU-Brooklyn Speech Language Hearing Clinic and Speech-Audiology Laboratory and the YVY Multilingual/dialectal Research Institute. This REU program thus serves two purposes: to involve undergraduates in research projects that can be expected to contribute publishable results and novel data sets that will be made available to the field through open-access websites, while simultaneously encouraging and preparing minoritized students to undertake graduate work on diverse languages and cultures. This REU site will prepare students to become accomplished researchers and practitioners in language sciences equipped with STEM-based knowledge and skills to work with minoritized languages and populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than 1 million surgeries to repair torn ligaments and tendons are performed in the United States annually. However, the failure rates are reported to be as high as 25% and the majority of failures are attributed to a technical error, which costs the US healthcare system $2.5 billion each year. Stitching has been identified as a critical, technically complex step in the surgery that, if improved, can be a way to reduce the incidence of failure. Current stitching needles have serious limitations that make stitching slow, tedious, and inaccurate. The two-part needle technology proposed in this project fundamentally changes how stitching can be performed. Better quality and faster stitching provides a societal benefit of improved patient outcomes as well as commercial benefits of avoided costs associated with failed surgeries and savings from reduced procedure times.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports development of a revolutionary suturing device that will advance stitching capabilities for orthopedic ligament and tendon repair surgery. The groundbreaking two-part needle design offers a value proposition of improved speed and quality of stitching, two essential elements for clinical success. This project has two overarching technical objectives: First, prototypes will be constructed with variable characteristics, and force testing will be performed to determine how each characteristic impacts functionality of the device. Performance of the device with regards to forces experienced during stitching will be compared to conventional needles. Second, prototypes will be constructed and tested by potential customers to assess usability for the intended purpose of creating specific stitch patterns. Speed of stitching and biomechanical strength of the stitch patterns will be compared to patterns created with conventional needles to quantify the value proposition. Successful completion of the objectives will substantially advance the two-part needle technology toward commercialization in orthopedics and provide a basis for additional research of the two-part needle design for other surgical applications that rely on stitching.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding NT dynamics is essential to understanding brain function but the means by which specific neurotransmitters achieve their behavioral effects is still largely unknown and requires accurate, real-time quantification in brain structures. To meet this challenge, in this project funded by the CBET, Biosensing program of the CMMI division, a collaborative team of biosensing experts, computer engineers and neurophysiologists at Clarkson University and the White River Junction VA Medical center are developing novel electrochemical enzyme biosensors that can measure multiple NTs with increased accuracy with little or no false detection. The biosensors will be integrated with statistical and machine learning methods and will be used to study the neurochemical environment in a rat model of Parkinson?s Disease. The research will enhance education and training of life sciences and engineering students at Clarkson University who will work synergistically with the team of investigators to develop next generation biosensing technologies for monitoring neurotransmission in the brain. <br/><br/>The project will develop biosensing devices that incorporate NT-specific materials and electrode surfaces for in vivo monitoring of neuronal activity. The research team will engineer an oxygen-rich nanoarchitecture containing an enzyme-like biomimetic catalyst and NT-specific enzymes, stabilized within a conductive network and develop automatic fabrication procedures to ensure scalable and reproducible manufacturing of these biosensors. These materials will be designed to ensure long-term bioactivity and operability for recognition of specific NTs and are expected to improve our ability to study the complex neural mechanisms involved in signaling in the brain. Research will involve the following tasks: 1) develop selective NT-specific nanostructures with high durability and sensitivity for enzyme-based microbiosensors that can measure dopamine, glutamate and acetylcholine, 2) computational work to produce predictive fingerprint models of NT dynamics using electrochemical data, and 3) in vivo work to determine the temporal profile of changes in NT concentrations during high frequency stimulation in normal and ?hemi-parkinsonian? animals. Educational activities will involve 1) student participation in research and dissemination through presentations and publications, 2) hands on education though implementation of a biosensing module in the new interdisciplinary Biomedical Engineering and Biomedical Science and Technology degree programs at Clarkson, 3) sites and virtual visits and demonstrations of neuromonitoring and neurostimulation experiments in live animals at Dartmouth College. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefit from the discovery of new NT-specific materials and the development of novel biosensing tolls that could be used broadly by the biomedical community for studying neurochemical changes in the brain, as well as the education and training of students who will be uniquely trained to tackle grand challenges in neuroscience and device engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different neuromodulators often target the same brain areas and neurons to act either synergistically or antagonistically. Major obstacles to studying the effect of these interactions on the circuit activity and behavior have been the sheer complexity of the circuit and the presence of redundant receptor families of neuromodulators. This project will tackle these issues by utilizing a simple genetic model organism and provide mechanistic insights into how two major neuromodulator pathways interact with each other to induce synaptic plasticity. The results of this study will lead to a fundamental understanding of the key mechanisms of learning and memory that are generally applicable to multiple species. The project will also contribute to the STEM education for the general public through the outreach program, in which the principal investigator will host K-12 teachers for the summer internship. In addition, both US and Israeli laboratories will train undergraduate and graduate researchers and facilitate their scientific interactions through close collaboration across the countries.<br/><br/>This project will use olfactory learning in Drosophila as a platform to study interactions between multiple neuromodulators. The focused brain area is the mushroom body (MB), a learning center of insects. Although dopamine has been known to play a central role in modulating olfactory signals in the MB, recent comprehensive ultrastructural study suggested the existence of abundant cholinergic interconnections between MB neurons. Despite the fact that acetylcholine is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the insect brain, little is known about the role played by its G-protein-coupled muscarinic receptors in learning and memory. The objective of this study is to understand how dopamine and acetylcholine act in concert on the same set of neurons to exert their effects on learning. Sophisticated genetic tools, in vivo electrophysiology, two-photon functional imaging and behavioral assays will be employed to determine how muscarinic receptors modulate olfactory responses in the MB neurons and how they affect dopamine-induced synaptic plasticity. Since metabotropic glutamate receptors, which can be regarded as the mammalian counterpart of insect muscarinic receptors, are widespread in the brain and known to interact with other neuromodulators, the proposed research is expected not only to contribute to fundamental progress in the field of Drosophila learning and memory, but also to provide general insights into neuronal plasticity across multiple brain areas and species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Long of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, is developing new classes of single-molecule magnets. These remarkable molecules behave as tiny, nanoscopic bar magnets, and therefore offer the potential to revolutionize technologies such as information storage and processing. The primary focus of this project is to employ synthetic chemistry to tailor the local environment of molecules with atomic-level precision to give rise to new single-molecule magnets with optimized properties, with the ultimate goal of realizing single-molecule magnets that operate at or near room temperature. This project lies at the interface of inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry, and is therefore well-suited to broadly educate and train young scientists. Finally, virtual science lessons on topics such as states of matter and magnetism will be produced in collaboration with a local community outreach program and taught to elemental school students in the Bay Area. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop novel synthetic approaches to enhance magnetic anisotropy, strengthen magnetic coupling, and increase magnetic relaxation times in single-molecule magnets, with the goal of realizing unprecedented operating temperatures. In addition to the myriad technological applications envisioned for single-molecule magnets, their size and electronic structure gives rise to the coexistence of classical and quantum properties, such as magnetic hysteresis and quantum tunneling of the magnetization, respectively. Therefore, single-molecule magnets provide a platform that can be used to predictably engender and fundamentally study novel magnetic behavior at the intersection of quantum and classical physics. Further, the exotic transition metal, lanthanide, and actinide coordination environments that will be targeted for generating designer magnetism have the potential to engender novel chemical reactivity. Finally, it is expected that the magnetic properties of the proposed molecules will afford direct insight into the behavior of other exotic though distinct magnetic species, such as surface adsorbed adatoms, single-chain magnets, and bulk magnetic materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a critical area of investigation because signal-dependent coordination of cell behavior is essential for the growth of all life forms. Signaling also plays a crucial role in dividing stem cells, ensuring that the proper number of stem cells are available to participate in tissue renewal and repair. Additionally, errors in signaling are the primary cause of cancer. Because cancer also entails unregulated cell division, it is particularly important to understand how division may exacerbate signaling errors. To explore this fundamentally important question, this collaborative research project encompasses three institutions, Princeton University, Swarthmore College and Colby College. The combined expertise will enable comprehensive investigations of signaling in dividing cells using an array of organisms, along with cutting edge genetic manipulation and imaging technologies. Additionally, this collaboration will pursue an ambitious outreach program which will include ? 1) providing enriching research experiences for a diverse group of undergraduates, 2) development of a class focused on cancer biology for elementary school students in an underserved school district as part of the established Science for Kids summer program at Swarthmore College, 3) integration between Summer Scholars Programs at Colby, Princeton and Swarthmore which focus on preparing URM and other diverse students for a successful college transition and 4) teacher-training opportunities at the Colby Center for Teaching and Learning for Princeton post-docs who will be teaching courses in the Colby January Term program. <br/><br/>Cellular trafficking of receptors and associated membrane proteins can profoundly impact cell signaling. Due to the long-held assumption that membrane trafficking is shut down during mitosis, current research has not addressed fundamental questions regarding the nature and regulation of trafficking in dividing cells. In particular, the contributions of mitotic kinases to endocytic trafficking remain poorly characterized. Additionally, the roles of specific endocytic pathways have not been delineated. This project aims to fill these critical gaps through a collaborative effort incorporating two experimental systems in which prior research has demonstrated an essential role for mitotic trafficking: polarization of mammalian epidermal cells and induction of heart progenitor cells in the basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis. It will investigate two hypotheses; 1) Cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) suppresses lysosomal degradation in a cargo-specific manner. 2) CDK1 and Aurora Kinase (AurK) suppress recycling broadly during mitosis. These hypotheses will be examined with well-established methods that disrupt specific mitotic kinases and endocytic pathways and employ high-resolution live-imaging assays to visualize the impact on receptor trafficking in both model systems. By conducting these studies on a range of cargo proteins in two highly divergent cell types, these findings will provide insights into the impact of mitotic trafficking on ? 1) fate decisions in developing embryos 2) re-establishment of polarity in dividing epithelial sheets and 3) signal dependent behaviors of stem cells or differentiated lineages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The impurities in water from different geographical locations and different types of water (e.g., seawater, industrial wastewater, tap water reuse) differ, and separation membranes that can selectively remove different combinations of impurities will be critical to addressing this world challenge.  The technology provides a means to greatly eliminate costly cleaning operations and minimize plant downtime in this ~$5 billion market.

These novel membranes will provide a long sought after revolution in water purification membranes with their high resistance to chlorine for disinfection and ability to prevent biofouling.  For the first time, they will also efficiently remove monovalent salts that contaminate seawater and brackish water from their mixed salt compositions. Sulfonated polysulfones have been considered previously for RO membranes due to their inherent chemical resistance, but they failed due to low salt rejection at high ionic strengths and their inferiority in salt rejections in mixed salt feedwater.  Municipal water requirements are high and their process water is often contaminated with toxic products (boron and arsenic moieties, hydrocarbons, perfluorinated surfactants, biofilms),  making reuse difficult to impossible technically and economically. This project advances material synthesis and material processing through precisely sulfonated polymers.

The goal of this CAREER project is to develop patient-specific cellular engineered tissue models and computer models to study the roles of arrhythmic triggers, including biomechanical and emotional stress.  The electrical and contractile properties of cardiac tissues engineered using stem cells obtained from WPW patients and healthy family members will be measured as the tissues are stretched and/or exposed to physiological stimulants. The knowledge gained from experiments and computer models will facilitate therapeutic development and improve patient care, thus advancing national health. Through supporting outreach and education, the project advances NSF?s mission to increase diversity and inclusion in STEM by addressing a need for cultural change in the Providence community through school science programs and art designed to engage and empower underrepresented students, parents, teachers, and the public. Activities include launching an ?Engineering the Heart? 3rd grade module with teacher training and hands-on curricula and developing a science art exhibit for parents and the public to increase engagement in STEM education and encourage cultural change for equity in STEM.<br/><br/>The investigators?s research focus is on improving human heart health through developing novel technologies and platforms for regenerating muscle, predicting toxicity, and understanding disease.  Consistent with this focus, the goal of this CAREER project is to understand how ion currents and tissue geometry initiate and sustain arrhythmias in WPW like fast heart rate and AFib.  As the mechanisms underlying atrial arrhythmia are often multi-factorial, driven by structural and electrophysiological remodeling in atrial tissue, there is a significant need for developing experimental platforms that can isolate arrhythmia mechanisms in order to dissect atrial arrhythmias and enable therapeutic development. To address this need, novel human in vitro and computational models will be developed to enable individual perturbations and their combinations to elicit arrhythmic phenotypes in excitation and contraction. Physiological function will be assessed in 3D engineered tissues containing patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived atrial cardiomyocytes to address the hypothesis that mechanical stretch, a correlate of high blood pressure, and emotional stress (activation of ?-adrenergic pathways or the ?fight-or-flight? response) will increase automaticity, frequency-dependent contractions, and conduction irregularities to reveal reentry pathways. The research objectives are to (1) derive new patient and control hiPSC lines and evaluate differentiated atrial cardiomyocytes for atrial specificity and WPW phenotype, (2) use 3D engineered tissues to evaluate excitation and contraction responses to atrial-specific ion channel modulators and use our computational action potential model to understand hiPSC-atrial cardiomyocyte ion currents in WPW, and (3) use 3D experimental and computational macrotissues to assess how stretch and ?-adrenergic stimulation modulate arrhythmic phenotypes of excitation and contraction. This research project will advance the capabilities in research to study and understand diverse arrhythmia mechanisms with tailored engineered tissue to improve the diagnosis, stratification, health, and quality of life for millions of patients with AFib.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although most human designs of propulsors such as wings or propellers are rigid, natural propulsors are generally flexible. Propulsive efficiencies of natural flyers and swimmers are typically higher than human-designed vehicles of similar weight and dimensions. However, attempts to emulate flexible animal designs have met with limited success. Recent comparative animal studies have demonstrated startlingly consistent patterns of bending kinematics among a broad diversity of swimmers and flyers constructed from very different materials and of very different physical dimensions. These patterns encompass cilia to whale flukes and fluid regimes from water to air. This project will use computational fluid dynamics and particle image velocimetry to measure fluid velocities to investigate the mechanical and fluid dynamic details that enable high force production by flexible natural propulsors.  K-12 outreach activities are planned at the universities and at the Cabrillo Aquarium in San Pedro, CA and undergraduate and graduate student involvement is core to the research project. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a set of design rules that govern force production by flexible propulsors. To achieve this goal, experiments and computations will be used to investigate: a) bending kinematics of propulsors as control surfaces of vorticity, pressure fields and thrust, b) the hydrodynamic basis of vortex-vortex interactions that generate pressure fields and thrust and c) the advantageous limits of bending kinematics. Each of these will be investigated using a combination of experiments (particle image velocimetry) with natural organisms and computational fluid dynamic models. The results of this project will define the necessary design criteria that enable performance enhancement by bending propulsors of different types and across a range of fluid regimes.

(TUC). When molecules absorb light, they are excited into a higher energy state and in TUC, the energy of two excited molecules fuses into a single excited state that is more energetic and has greater reactive potential. TUC photophysics is robust and applicable to a remarkable breadth of chemical, technological, and biological applications including solar energy conversion, chemical catalysis, light-promoted polymerization, and biological imaging. This project marshals a program that joins spectroscopy, chemical synthesis, and theory to consider fundamental aspects of this process. The understanding gained in this research will push the next-generation of molecules and materials to new levels in their ability to manipulate light energy obtained through absorption. The research team will also engage in scientific outreach at the high school level through an established relationship with the DSST schools in the Denver metropolitan area. This is a remarkable STEM-based school system with a 100% college acceptance rate for high school graduates amongst a total population that is 71% economically challenged and overwhelmingly racially diverse. Through an online synchronous platform in response to the COVID crisis, the team offer an 8-week elective to explore spectroscopy and photophysics using highly accessible 3D-printed parts, a few other inexpensive components, and a cell phone camera. <br/><br/>This project centers around the ideas of excited state dynamical control. In the vast majority of TUC systems, monomer chromophores are used, and collisions or non-diffusional monomer/monomer encounters are called upon to negotiate all triplet fusion events. This results in very little control of the multiexciton dynamics that are critical contributors to overall yield. Matters are challenged because spin statistics are in play and because the singlet channel required for TUC is the smallest in its statistical weight. In this project, the team plans to fundamentally alter, and interrogate, the number and types of multi-exciton pathways that may contribute to successful TUC using structurally well-defined dimer systems.  The team believes that the structural definition of their systems in concert with the control they maintain in manipulating physiochemical properties ? such as excited state reaction driving force, excited state couplings, interchromophore spin coupling magnitudes, molecular size, and solubility ? will potentially allow them to assess TUC efficiency gains achieved by exploiting intramolecular multiexciton dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, efforts to date have been unsuccessful, and surgical spaying remains as the sole option available for sterilizing female animals. At present, sterilization is an invasive surgical procedure that requires the removal of a healthy animal?s reproductive organs at great risk and physical cost to the dog, financial and emotional cost to the owner, time cost to the veterinarian, and significant financial cost to shelters.

With notable exceptions, such as the 2016 Pawnee Oklahoma earthquake, these earthquakes often hide below cultural seismic noise. This presents a challenge for both monitoring and detecting them. It impedes studying their causes and assessing corresponding hazards. In the U.S., regions that have been free of earthquakes are now pressed to find reliable ways to address earthquake risks. Research on induced seismicity has expanded in the last decade; but studies have mostly focused on known hotspots in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. Yet, it is expected that induced earthquakes will occur in regions which did not face this threat before. It is, thus, critical to monitor and catalog the natural baseline seismicity in these regions before induced earthquakes happen; this allows detecting when seismicity rises above background levels and assessing the risks. One such location is the State of Louisiana. It is currently at the threshold of implementing CO2 storage and increased oil and gas exploration. However, Louisiana lacks a statewide seismic network and monitoring program to assess seismic hazards. Here, the researchers integrate research and education in the aim to understand human-driven changes in Louisiana. Deploying geophysical and seismic instruments, they study three key locations related to human activities and resources. These locations are: 1) in northwest Louisiana, a region with high wastewater injection rates; 2) an underground storage cavern, where ground motions have been reported and nearby sinkhole formation has occurred (with precursor earthquake activity); 3) across the Baton Rouge fault that also acts as a patchy barrier for salt water. Integrating multiple data types, the team gradually unveils the new threats Louisiana is facing. The project also provides support to an early-career female scientist, one postdoctoral researcher, and graduate and undergraduate students. It includes the establishment of student-focused regional workshops, notably on Machine Learning applications in Geophysics. The project also fosters broadening participation in science, e.g., by involving students from the Southern University at Baton Rouge, a Historically Black University. This project is jointly funded by the Geophysics Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project is an integrated geophysical study of multiple data types. It produces a detailed characterization of fluid-involved crustal deformation. The results have important societal implications for energy corridors undergoing rapid human change. They characterize the largely unknown deformation of the subsurface beneath a region that supplies a major part of the U.S. oil and gas. This region is challenged by ongoing subsidence, groundwater salinization, and increasing seismicity associated with wastewater disposal from hydrocarbon exploration. The seismic arrays installed at three key locations not only measure the levels of seismicity, but also constrain the poorly understood aseismic deformation. Indeed, innovative techniques are applied, such as Fracture Seismic imaging, that image fluid-filled networks by using harmonic resonances within fractures. Seismological methods are integrated with GPS data analysis to understand the deformation budget of the crust. This approach provides insight into the pattern of crustal deformation driven by human activities.  One expected outcome is the first high-resolution mapping of fracture geometry and connectivity, subsurface material properties, and seismic and aseismic deformation in the region. The study, thus, has far-reaching impacts on our general understanding of fluid-driven processes and their effects on crustal deformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plant seeds are fundamental to of all agriculture. Seeds are complex structures, consisting of a protective seed coat, an embryo, and a nutritive endosperm. Endosperm is one of the most important tissues in the biosphere ? it provides two-thirds of the calories consumed by humans. Although endosperm does not pass on any genetic material to the next generation, proper endosperm development is essential for the formation of viable seeds and the completion of the flowering plant life cycle. This project focuses on the contribution of a plant-specific RNA polymerase, RNA Pol IV, to endosperm development and function. The research will increase fundamental understanding of endosperm biology and may facilitate the development of plant hybrids. This project also provides interdisciplinary, cutting-edge training for undergraduates from groups under-represented in science, graduate students, and postdocs in genomics, plant biology, epigenetics, biophysics, and bioinformatics. Teachers will also participate in aspects of the proposed research, facilitating transfer of the excitement of scientific discovery and scientific reasoning to their students. <br/><br/>Endosperm has an unusual genetic constitution ? it is typically triploid, with two maternally-inherited and one paternally-inherited genomes. RNA Pol IV regulates transcriptional programs and the balance of expression between maternal and paternal gene copies in endosperm. It is known that RNA Pol IV is required for the biogenesis of 24 nucleotide small RNAs. Typically, these small RNAs arise from transposable elements and other repetitive sequences and direct DNA methylation to matching genomic regions in a process termed RNA-directed DNA methylation. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that can influence transcription. However, in endosperm the relationship between Pol IV activity, small RNAs, DNA methylation, and gene expression profiles is not predictable based on current understanding of this pathway. The goal of the proposed research is to determine how, when, and where RNA Pol IV acts to influence gene transcription and to regulate expression from maternally- and patternally-derived genomes in Arabidopsis thaliana endosperm. Current thought suggests that RNA Pol IV mediates conflict between maternal and paternal genomes in the endosperm. The specific objectives of the research are to determine how RNA Pol IV activity in endosperm regulates gene expression and to determine the genetic and molecular basis of antagonistic RNA Pol IV maternal and paternal effects. Diverse genetic, genomic, biophysical, and developmental biology approaches will be employed to address these aims. The research activities will provide substantial new understanding of the epigenetic processes that act before and after fertilization to mediate parental genetic conflicts and promote seed viability.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, both in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, it is important to understand the magnitude and sources of N2O to the atmosphere in order to predict future climate impacts. The ocean is a significant source of N2O to the atmosphere, but its overall contribution is uncertain. A significant amount of the marine N2O delivered to the atmosphere comes from the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP). This region is host to some of the lowest oxygen concentrations in the entire ocean, which is favorable to a massive production of N2O. Previous estimates of the amount of N2O diffusing out of the ETP to the atmosphere considered only the area directly over the high N2O region of the ETP. However, there are strong subsurface currents that flow away from the ETP, westward along the equator, and N2O carried away in these equatorial currents has been overlooked when determining the contribution of the ETP to marine emissions of N2O. This proposed work will use new, high-quality N2O data collected on 3 Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) cruises through the tropical Pacific to investigate N2O cycling across the entire tropical Pacific Ocean. Low oxygen regions, like the ETP, are predicted to expand in the future, potentially leading to an increase in N2O production, underscoring the importance of understanding N2O cycling in this region. This project will support mentoring up to two undergraduate summer interns. <br/><br/>Recent advances in analytical capabilities within the NOAA/PMEL Trace Gas group, and their application to three Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) repeat hydrography cruises through the tropical Pacific, have facilitated the collection of nitrous oxide measurements of unprecedented quality and coverage of the region, together with complementary hydrographic parameters. We propose to use this new, high-quality GO-SHIP N2O data in concert with the stable isotopic composition of nitrous oxide, tracers of ventilation rates, and current velocities to investigate the transport, production, and efflux of nitrous oxide in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Using both observation data and idealized modeling, the research will (i) estimate the magnitude of the physical transport of N2O to/from the ETP, and losses to the atmosphere, and (ii) differentiate the sources of N2O in equatorial currents between advection from the ETP and in situ production. The work proposed here will lead to a more nuanced understanding of N2O production, transport, and fate in the tropical Pacific.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These storms often induce overwash, a process where water and sediments flow over coastal barriers, erode the beach, and deposit sediments atop and behind the barrier. Geoscientists often use deposits of overwash in coastal ponds to infer when hurricanes occurred in the past, prior to written and satellite records of hurricanes. These sedimentary records of past hurricane activity are useful for constraining the probability of a hurricane making landfall on a stretch of coastline, or for understanding changes in hurricane frequency in response to past changes in climate, and are commonly integrated into hazard assessments. However, these sedimentary records are limited to reconstructing the frequency of past storms, while inferences into the magnitude or track of these events remain preliminary. In this project, the investigators will harness recent advances in computer simulations of coastal sediment transport to develop a new approach for reconstructing storm strength and track from overwash deposits. <br/><br/>This project will integrate field-based observations of overwash from sediment cores with state-of-the-art simulations of observed and simulated hurricanes to: (i) evaluate the influences of storm properties on overwash deposition in back-barrier settings, (ii) diagnose the sensitivity of depositional patterns to geomorphic change, and (iii) relate storm strength and track to the properties of overwash deposits.

Machan of the University of Virginia is studying the catalytic reduction of dioxygen by molecular manganese compounds. The reduction of dioxygen is important for producing energy from chemical bonds. Fuel cells, for example, often employ the reduction of dioxygen to water to generate clean energy. The current best catalysts for this reaction are based on platinum metal, which is rare and expensive. In the search for earth-abundant alternatives, systems containing iron and cobalt have been studied extensively, however, manganese versions of these systems are more poorly understood. Manganese generally interacts strongly with dioxygen and has the potential to rival or exceed the catalytic activity of iron or cobalt. These studies will achieve this by developing design principles for dioxygen reduction by manganese complexes, thus enabling optimized systems with improved performance. Integrated into these efforts is a research-focused educational outreach program, which will develop a scientific communication training program and a research-based lab experience. The integrated research and educational components will address fundamental challenges for the field and priorities of the current NSF Strategic Plan, with the goal of maximizing the health, environmental and economic benefits of renewable energy technologies.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Charles W. Machan of the University of Virginia is studying the catalytic reduction of dioxygen by molecular manganese compounds. When paired with the oxidation of energy rich molecules, dioxygen reduction is a convenient way to drive oxidation reactions or to convert chemical energy to electrical energy. Manganese metal centers, while underrepresented as molecular catalyst active sites, have strong interactions with dioxygen and could demonstrate catalytic activity that rivals or exceeds the activity of more well-understood iron and cobalt species. A coordination chemistry-based approach will be used to enhance the binding and activation of dioxygen by tuning electronic properties at the Mn center, with the ultimate goal of improving catalytic performance. In initial studies, conditions for the selective generation of hydrogen peroxide or water as the reaction product have been developed: hydrogen peroxide is a valuable chemical oxidant and water is the desired half-reaction for fuel cells. Understanding how to achieve high selectivity and activity for each of these products has implications for renewable energy utilization. To address the ongoing need for fundamental understanding of the reduction of dioxygen by manganese complexes, the role of axial ligands in dioxygen binding and activation will be quantified, the catalytic response will be improved by synthetically modifying the ligand framework, and conditions for selective hydrogen peroxide and water production will be sought using redox mediators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon, known as ocean acidification, not only poses serious threat to the health of many marine ecosystems, but also decreases the ocean?s capacity as a major sink for carbon dioxide which in turn will likely accelerate the increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Therefore, to accurately predict ocean?s chemical and biological responses to future ocean acidification, it is essential to understand how various ocean regions have already responded to the atmospheric dioxide increase since the pre-industrial era. This project seeks to use coral skeletons to reconstruct histories of surface ocean acidity over the past ~300 years. The chemistry of coral skeletons changes with the composition of the seawater in which corals grow and is thus an excellent archive of past changes in ocean acidity. This project provides a much-needed historical perspective on the current and future ocean acidification. It supports the education and training of one graduate student and at least one undergraduate. It also promotes the education about ocean acidification and coral research in local middle and high schools through planned outreach activities.<br/><br/>Ocean acidification reduces seawater pH and the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater. It threatens the health of many marine ecosystems, especially the survival of marine calcifying organisms that need carbonate ions to produce their calcium carbonate skeletons. Furthermore, it decreases the ocean?s capacity as a major sink for anthropogenic CO2 which in turn will likely accelerate the increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. However, instrumental records of seawater pH are sparse and at most only span the last ~3-4 decades. Geochemical compositions of the carbonate skeletons of marine calcifying organism vary as a function of the physicochemical conditions of the seawater in which these organisms live, and provide one of the few opportunities to extend our records of past changes in seawater pH. In particular, the boron isotope composition of long-lived coral skeleton is regarded as a very promising proxy of seawater pH. However, accurate interpretation of coral boron isotope composition in terms of seawater pH is not straightforward, as growing evidence suggests that many factors other than pH, such as seawater temperature and biological regulation, can also influence coral boron isotope composition. The investigator team will synthesize and re-evaluate coral-based constraints on surface ocean pH, building on recent improved understanding of the mechanisms of coral calcification. The PI team will (1) develop an inverse Bayesian method for accurate seawater pH reconstruction considering all factors influencing coral boron isotope composition; (2) produce robust surface ocean pH records over the last ~300 years by applying the Bayesian method to published coral records; (3) determine the drivers of surface ocean pH variations at different sites on annual to multi-decadal scales. In addition to providing a much-needed historical perspective on the current and future ocean acidification, this project will produce a suite of numerical methods that are readily to be used by the community for robust coral-based seawater pH reconstruction and for accelerating future experimental studies in this field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Texas experienced a similar (though smaller-scale) event 10 years earlier, and yet no substantial changes/preparations were made in the wake of that storm.  This project focuses on the public?s response to the recent crisis to learn about who citizens hold accountable and whether the crisis influenced their energy policy preferences.  The PIs survey Texans at multiple points after the crisis, asking about, among other topics, the costs of policy changes, the public?s opinions on different energy sectors, and debates over how much the government should be involved in regulating markets.  By looking at who Texans blame for the failure, what reforms they support, and how experiences and the passing of time affect preferences and perceptions, the study builds understandings of how citizens hold governments to account in the wake of crisis and failure.  The project also provides immediate insights to policymakers, highlighting areas of policy agreement and temporal ?windows? when governmental reforms are going to have more/less public support. <br/> <br/>This project focuses on the public?s responses to the Texas power outage to better understand why crises often fail to lead to governmental action. The PIs consider the following questions: Who does the public blame for service disruption and its consequences?   How malleable is public opinion in the wake of such a disaster?  How quickly (if at all) do any observed effects on public opinion dissipate?  And, what factors ? whether individual, interpersonal, or contextual ? condition people?s responses?  The PIs conduct a series of survey experiments with a statewide, representative panel of Texans.  These experiments focus on cost/benefit arguments about investment in infrastructure, the blaming of certain energy sectors (e.g., renewables), and debates over regulatory policies. By conducting survey experiments, the PIs draw on a design tradition that is marked by both high internal and external validity.  By repeating the experiments with the same individuals two months after the crisis and again 8 months after the crisis, the project evaluates whether any effects fade (or increase) over time as recovery takes place, policies are changed, and messaging evolves.

However, some bacteria such as probiotics are beneficial to the health of humans, animals, and plants (e.g. probiotics) and others are used in production of food and pharmaceuticals. Antibiotics are used to remove disease-causing bacteria.  A common way  that antibiotics work is to cause the mechanical failure of the bacterial cell envelope ? i.e. causing the cells to burst open and die. However, antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are increasingly abundant in the environment, presenting a challenge to health and food production. The goal of this project is to understand how bacteria resist the mechanical forces that would normally cause them to burst. We explore the novel idea that bacteria can sense excessive stretching in their cell membranes and cell wall and respond to this sensation by thickening and strengthening their cell walls to prevent death. Additionally, the project involves a project to broaden participation in science and engineering through inclusion of undergraduate researchers and work with a minority serving professional society. <br/><br/>The work uses a novel microfluidic system to generate mechanical stress within the cell envelope of individual bacteria and observe the response using conventional and single molecule microscopy.

As the coastal current transporting much of the fresh water on the shelf reaches the Cape, the strong wind forcing combined with its orientation with respect to the coastline curvature and complex bathymetry may flush water offshore there.  The project will deploy drifters and profiling floats, interpreted in the context of modeled circulation to investigate how this high volume freshwater may enter the open ocean. Prior studies have indicated the potential influence this exported shelf water may have on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and hence global climate. The project will support the career development of an observational young investigator, a project-specific website will be developed, an undergraduate summer student fellow will help analyze the data, and a volunteer undergraduate student will participate in a research cruise. This work will clarify how shelf-derived fresh water at high latitudes can influence the large-scale ocean circulation, and should be applicable to other regions where buoyant coastal currents veer around sharp bathymetry. Broader relevance will include addressing where and how meltwater may affect the North Atlantic spring bloom through its supply of micronutrients and stratification of the subpolar North Atlantic.<br/><br/><br/>The current melting of the Arctic and the Greenland Ice Sheet introduces enough fresh water into the subpolar North Atlantic to significantly alter the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, but where and how this water leaves the shelf ocean to interact with the boundary currents and deep basins of the subpolar North Atlantic is poorly constrained. This project will use a joint observational and modeling study to explore the pathways and fate of fresh water around Cape Farewell, and to determine the forcing mechanisms that drive the fluxes. Surface drifters and rapidly-profiling Argo floats will be deployed along the southeast Greenland shelf in 2021 and 2022 to assess the along-stream, cross-stream, and vertical coherency of the coastal current. The modeling component will seed a high-resolution (~2 km lateral grid spacing) year-long run of the MITgcm with virtual floats in the coastal current to follow their pathways around Cape Farewell, complemented by an examination of model circulation response to internal instabilities and external forcing, and quantification of the resulting modeled shelf-basin exchange. This work will provide the first comprehensive study of the shelf-basin exchange around Cape Farewell, a process often invoked to explain North Atlantic variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All of these differences?thickness, buoyancy, and age?can be attributed to the properties of and the processes occurring within the Earth?s mantle. This study will use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to image the mantle beneath continents, employing methods similar to those used to perform CT scans on the human body.

In terms of broader impacts, the project will support one graduate student and several undergraduates, including at least one from an under-represented group in STEM. <br/><br/>This study will advance understanding of the processes that form and modify cratons by developing new models of the seismic attenuation, velocity, and anisotropy structure at several cratons around the globe. To accomplish this, the study will: (1) perform co-located analyses of Rayleigh wave attenuation and anisotropic phase velocity, Ps and Sp receiver functions, and shear-wave splitting; (2) determine depth-dependent models of shear velocity, shear attenuation, and azimuthal anisotropy from the body- and surface-wave data using both forward and inverse approaches; (3) test hypotheses for the origin of midlithospheric discontinuities by interpreting the seismic models together with the elastic properties of peridotite and hydrous phases and with anelasticity experiments; (4) through incorporation of mantle-xenolith and heat-flow data, develop a method for estimating lithospheric thermal and chemical structure that can be applied in ice-covered regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Project tasks include identifying optimal science operation modes, commissioning and checking out the satellite upon deployment to its desired orbit, and verifying science operations in order to get the longest possible science mission duration.  These are highly time sensitive tasks, necessitating a RAPID grant award. Undergraduate and graduate students at Montana State University will continue to be integral participants in the project.

IT-SPINS will profile the oxygen ion distribution in the topside ionosphere from low Earth orbit through remote sensing of 135.6nm emissions from the nighttime ionosphere.  Completed under challenging circumstances during the pandemic, the cubesat was launched in February 2021 and is in an interim parking orbit on the International Space Station, from where it will be deployed in May 2021 to its unique orbit for science investigations.  This RAPID project capitalizes on previous NSF investments by commissioning the IT-SPINS cubesat and performing science operations testing and evaluation.  Owing to the very limited time on orbit prior to reentry of the satellite, it is prudent to perform these tasks before deployment into the desired orbit (for planning and simulations) and as quickly as practical after deployment (for operations evaluations) in order to get the longest possible science mission duration.

The efficiency of current LEDs drastically decreases from ?80% in the blue-light regions to ?15% in the green region. This lack of a suitable semiconductor green light source is known as the ?green gap? problem. This research aims to address this problem by developing green LEDs based on an entirely new family of semiconductor materials called chalcogenide perovskite. The proposed work is a critical step towards opening a new frontier in semiconductor device research based on chalcogenide perovskites, with far reaching impacts on applications such as sensing, energy harvesting, information processing, and storage. The use of earth-abundant elements in these materials can reduce our nation?s reliance on rare-earth materials. Through collaboration with local industry, the proposed work will also develop samples and instrumentation for advanced laboratory courses, which will not only impact STEM education in the US and worldwide, but also the local economy in Western New York. The research activities involving machine learning, first-principles computation, material synthesis, device fabrication, and characterization, will offer important interdisciplinary training to a broad student body.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to demonstrate the first chalcogenide perovskite-based light emitting diodes, with the long-term goal of bridging the green gap in LED technology. This will involve an iterative process in which theoretical prediction will guide material synthesis and atomic level structural, optical, and carrier transport characterization will inform theoretical models as well as device design and fabrication. The idea of this work was conceived based on the principal investigators' recent prediction and realization of chalcogenide perovskite materials with tunable band gap and promising semiconducting properties. The specific project objectives are to: i) Develop a low temperature chalcogenide perovskite thin-film processing technique compatible with device fabrication and growing high quality SrHfS3 and SrZrS3 thin films with strong green and amber light emission. ii) Control device properties through concerted first-principles computation and experiments of atomic scale structural, optical, and carrier transport characteristic. iii) Design, fabricate, and evaluate green and amber LEDs from n- and p- type doped SrHfS3 and SrZrS3 thin films. An innovative device fabrication technique incorporating micro-transfer-printing allows for dissimilar materials to form a high-quality p-i-n type LED structure with extremely clean interfaces without being constrained by their growth conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The risk of unnecessary or under-prescribed antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified future AMR threats, especially given that the incidence of bacterial sepsis occurs in 1 out of 7 COVID-19 inpatients, with a 50% mortality rate.

The assay would provide advantages over current standards of care (blood culture; BC), which typically require 24 to 72-hours to confirm the presence of a BSI. Additionally, this novel BSI assay does not require complex amplification steps (polymerase chain reaction; PCR) to detect pathogens. Given sepsis mortality rates increase by 7.6% per hour without appropriate antibiotic administration, septic patient care and survival demands early screening innovations that quickly and easily type species and determine AST to guide responsible antibiotic administration. The delayed results associated with current BSI testing methods hinders effective antibiotic selection, accuracy and timing. The proposed technology is comprised of a patent-pending bloodborne pathogen enrichment innovation that combines functionalized magnetic beads and the unique Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) substrate. The assay is built on three principles: (1) LAL contains highly sensitive proteins capable of detecting cell wall markers on gram-negative bacteria and fungi; (2) Differential LAL blocking would distinguish fungal and bacterial infection; and (3) Inclusion of a silkworm larvae plasma would provide a colorimetric output that detects gram-positive bacteria.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The solutions to such systems give rise to algebraic varieties, which are fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry.  Algebraic topology is the study of systematically attaching algebraic invariants (e.g., numbers or abstract algebraic structures) to spaces; these invariants should not depend on the way a space is pulled or twisted without tearing it.  When algebraic varieties have a spatial structure, it is natural to try to analyze them using the tools of algebraic topology.  However, when algebraic varieties do not have an obvious spatial structure, e.g., if they arise in arithmetic settings, then a new approach is required.  The focus of this project is to analyze algebraic invariants of algebraic varieties using the framework of the Morel-Voevodsky A^1-homotopy theory.  This theory allows one to apply the full power of techniques of algebraic topology to objects of interest in algebraic geometry ? one may treat spaces having complicated arithmetic structure, but a priori limited geometric structure, in essentially the same way as more classical spaces.  The current project seeks to analyze certain classical algebraic and arithmetic questions using these new techniques and to provide a better understanding of specific systems of algebraic equations, which is fundamental to many areas of mathematics. <br/> <br/>More specifically, the PI will study problems in linear algebra over commutative unital rings, for example, the theory of projective modules and decompositions of matrices.  These structures lie in the domain of algebraic K-theory and are related to topological and arithmetic questions by means of Morel-Voeovdsky A^1-homotopy theory.  Among others, the PI will investigate the following concrete (and classical) question: given a complex algebraic variety, which topological vector bundles admit algebraic structures?  By their very nature, such problems draw together several branches of mathematics and thus illustrate the fundamental unity of the subject.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Central to this proposal are findings that biofilms confer tolerance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents, whether these antimicrobial agents are antibiotics, disinfectants, or germicides. Dispersing these biofilms is necessary to remove contaminating bacteria from the plant surface. This proposal is addressing these challenges by developing safe and natural biofilm degrading enzymes from the collection of over 3,000 unique microorganisms called Dictyostelids isolated from five continents and several island nations. The focus of this proof-of-principle project is discovery of enzymes for treatment of bacterial potato soft rot.

While energy has become a metric of interest for mitigating thermal issues or increasing battery life of mobile devices, energy efficiency has largely neglected sustainability and in particular, computing's impact on the environment and energy resources of the planet.  For example, while embodied environmental costs (e.g., carbon emissions) of integrated-circuit (IC) manufacturing often exceed its operational carbon footprint, this is relatively unknown or the reverse is presumed to be true in the computing community. Furthermore, the use of rare metals such as tantalum, tungsten, and gold, in electronic equipment contribute to the inevitable exhaustion of the planet's resources.  There is an urgent need to consider factors beyond operational-phase energy consumption of the computing infrastructure to truly combat carbon and other harmful emissions present during the full computing lifecycle to combat the existential threat of climate change. <br/> <br/>This project proposes a series of community oriented activities culminating in a workshop to both increase awareness among researchers in the domain of computing about these factors of sustainable computing and to specify the challenges and potential possible solutions to achieve sustainable computing including, but also beyond the operational phase of the computing technology.  A particular goal will be to facilitate cross pollination of ideas among researchers across different disciplines encompassing not only computing sciences but also, environmental sciences and political sciences to identify sustainable methodologies for design and operation of computing infrastructure. The novelty and intellectual merit of this project is in identifying gaps in knowledge that need to be bridged to truly make computers sustainable.  In particular, this project will start with a series of invited talks from experts from diverse fields with deep insights on these aspects that ultimately affect the sustainability of computing resources targeted at computing researchers.

Programs written in Stan will be compiled to CompCert C through a succession of transformations, each of which handles a specific feature of Stan. These program transformations are specific to probabilistic programming languages, and include truncating distributions and re-parameterizing to support constraints on random variables.  The runtime implements a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that uses the compiled program to perform inference.

LP events are produced by fluids surging through cracks and faults in the Earth?s crust. Studying these events allows better understanding fluid movement and fault dynamics. This is important economically and to better assess seismic and volcanic hazards. However, seismic signals from LP events are small and challenging to detect and analyze. Here the researchers investigate these events at Clear Lake Volcanic Field.  They use seismology which is the study of seismic waves generated by earthquakes and travelling through the Earth.  The waves are detected at the surface and analyzed.  The researchers leverage on existing data. They combine state-of-the-art analytical techniques to better identify and locate the LP events. They examine the dynamic properties of the events (stress drops), their scaling with magnitude, and when possible the focal mechanisms of the earthquakes that produced them. The improved catalog of LP events, high-resolution locations, and focal mechanisms is used to investigate the fluid transport system in the region. The project outcomes ? which include refined methods and development of hybrid approaches to improve LP event analysis ? could be applied at other volcanic systems. The one-year project also supports a collaboration between academia and the industry, and educational outreach to the public. <br/><br/>The study is based on existing catalog of seismic waveform data that have shown to include LP events. These events are compared to non-volcanic tremor and low-frequency earthquakes at other places along the San Andreas fault system. The researchers search the continuous waveform data set using adaptive waveform template matching to identify LP events related to events already in the catalog. They develop new templates - based on waveform similarity - to further interrogate the data and detect and catalog new LP events. They use the double-difference location method to develop a high-resolution catalog. The detected events are analyzed using spectral modeling methods to estimate the scalar seismic moment and corner frequency; the goal is to assess possible scaling properties of the LP earthquakes. The team also utilizes three-component waveform data to determine focal parameters from moment tensor inversion. LP events are small and challenging to model and therefore require efforts toward the refinement of methods and the development of hybrid approaches to extract more reliable results. Because of their small magnitude, the researchers need to explore combined inversion scheme that utilizes a source-type inversion of both waveforms and first-motion polarities, possibly expanding the method to utilize body wave amplitude ratios. The results of the multipronged analysis will be used to investigate potential fault structure and the fluid transport system of the Clear Lake Volcanic Field.  It will also allow evaluating whether continued study is warranted with a possible portable array deployment to improve coverage to better investigate LP earthquake seismicity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled cybersecurity tool referred to as a knowledge graph (AISecKG) to address this cybersecurity education challenge. Knowledge graphs, widely used by search engines and social networks,  integrate data and can store linked descriptions of items such as objects, concepts, and events. This project applies a novel learning approach for cybersecurity education by providing university students a flexible learning plan that enhances their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This approach aims to help students understand the complex nature of cyber-attacks and defense mechanisms, provide them with a holistic view and better prepare them to address the complexities of real-world scenarios. <br/><br/>The development and deployment of AISecKG are interdisciplinary. First, the project employs machine learning (ML) and AI approaches to build a new cybersecurity knowledge graph by measuring and setting up similarities and dependencies among cybersecurity learning targets for both study planning and learning-outcome assessment. Second, it incorporates a multi-level assessment approach to design cybersecurity curricula, scaffold student cognitive engagement, and improve student learning outcomes. AISecKG has two primary design goals. First, it will guide instructors to develop a problem-based learning curriculum based on their learning objectives. Second, it will allow students to apply an adaptive learning strategy, incorporating hands-on labs to assess their learning outcomes. To assess students? learning performance quantitatively, AISecKG will (a) deploy an evidence-based model and learning materials for problem-based cybersecurity education focusing on developing teacher capacity and practice while using targeted materials and approaches; (b) produce a productive teaching model for deep learning that promotes a culture of scientific inquiry and design as well as a set of strategies to develop student competency; and (c) provide evidence of student learning outcomes as a pedagogical resource to support student cognitive engagement in learning tasks interactively. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PC is one of the lethal forms of cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Chemotherapy is the first-line standard treatment for cancer therapy. The medications used during chemotherapy are administered through an intravenous infusion (IV), pill, or injection. Once these medications enter the bloodstream, they destroy the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. The most common side effects for patients are nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and decreased immunity leading to a low quality of life. Our prototype aims to reduce chemotherapy side effects and the need for in-hospital chemotherapy administration, significantly reducing healthcare costs. The proposed innovative technology offers an alternative to direct surgical resection in the sensitive areas surrounding the pancreas. This treatment will extend the number of patients who can benefit from surgery and increase the overall success of surgeries primarily by preventing local relapse. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lay the essential foundation for understanding the medical device product's physical and chemical characteristics. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a ""silent"" disease because it is diagnosed at a much later stage when cancer has already metastasized. One of the significant challenges associated with PC treatment is the standard administration techniques (e.g., intravenous injection, oral administration) cannot efficiently deliver a therapeutic concentration of the drug to the tumor site because of the pancreas' anatomy. The innovative technology used in this prototype device will render it as an implantable, biodegradable, drug-eluting product allowing for spatio-temporal control and delivery of various active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) directly to the tumor site. Further, reductions in global toxicity and access to traditionally unresectable areas may enable higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents than could be tolerated by systemic administration, significantly altering the treatment landscape. This project will address the following four technical challenges related to the formulation and physical characteristics of the prototype, which will determine its release profile and the 3D printing mechanism, and its impact on the device's quality. The research and development routes that are being pursued include (1) assessment of prototype mechanical profile, starting with one API of interest (2) assessment of different polymer compositions and how they impact the flow of the printing material and resolution; (3) testing the use of fluorophores during the formulation of the prototype (4) assessment of different properties of the print material (e.g., pressure, print-head type, temperature, and viscosity) on the quality of the prototype.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacteria produce numerous compounds, or natural products that enable competition for resources, detoxifying environments, and carrying out critical cellular processes. Mycofactocin, a bacterial vitamin which is required for shuttling electrons in critical cellular processes in Mycobacteria. Mycofactocin is made from a peptide using a powerful enzyme, MftC, in a way that is unusual in comparison to other peptide natural products. This study is expected to result in new understanding of this chemistry and a new class of bioengineered redox cofactors, which in turn will help to elucidate mycofactocin-dependent physiological processes. This work allows for graduate students and middle school science teachers to gain specialized training in mechanistic enzymology and rational bioengineering. In addition, through outreach programming, this work will incorporate products produced by high school and middle school students. <br/><br/>Mycofactocin maturase, MftC, is a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme (rSAM) that catalyzes the most critical steps in mycofactocin biosynthesis. It is just one of a broad class of radical SAM enzymes in Nature and so mechanistic insights gleaned in this project will likely have much broader scientific impact upon studies and understanding of other members of this important enzymatic class. MftC modifies the precursor peptide, MftA, by oxidatively decarboxylating the C-terminal tyrosine and by the formation of a lactam between the penultimate valine and the C-terminal tyrosine. The reaction scope of MftC will be evaluated to determine the requirement of an electron sink (tyrosine) on the C-terminus and if the conservation of valine tunes the midpoint potential of mycofactocin. Objective 1 focuses on defining the mechanistic role of tyrosine by evaluating kinetic isotope effects and pKa effects of tyrosine analogs. Objective 2 establishes the chemical logic for the conservation of valine by evaluating substituent effects on the midpoint potential of mycofactocin.

For consumer end-users, this technology will provide an affordable, convenient, and accurate sunscreen effectiveness indicator to help keep them sun-safe.  For retailers, this technology will provide an innovative means to increase sales and grow the Suncare category as a whole without any cannibalization of existing sunscreen products (highly desired by retailers).  For sunscreen manufacturers/licensees, this technology has the potential to drive sunscreen consumption and sales by as much as 2-4x, grow brand recognition and increase unit profit margins.  <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the safety and accuracy of an ultraviolet/light-sensitive cosmetic dye (chromophore) intended to monitor sunscreen protection in real-time.

Though numerous attempts have been made to create indicators to measure sunscreen effectiveness, they are inaccurate, expensive and inconvenient, which accounts for their limited use and adoption by the industry and consumers.  Sunscreen Sun Protection Factor (SPF) ratings are the only global standard of protection and based on a sunscreen?s ability to protect users from sunburn.  Therefore, the first aim of this project is to determine the photoaction spectrum of the chromophore by spectrofluorometry and compare it to the Erythemal Response Curve?the relative type and intensities of ultraviolet radiation that cause sunburns.  The second aim will be to validate the chromophore will accurately change color when SPF levels drop below SPF 10-15 across a range of sunscreens of variable broadband (UVA/UVB) protection.

Today?s commercial ice storage systems, based on Ice-on-Coil (IOC) technology, fails to capture this potential because efficiently moving thermal energy into and out of water as it freezes and melts is challenging. The proposed Icephobic Heat Exchange (IHEX) technology eliminates the adhesion of freezing water to cold surfaces, preventing ice buildup on the coil and realizing the power of water for low-cost, high efficiency, resilient building cooling. IHEX based thermal storage removes the primary barriers to product adoption: high cost and spatial constraint limitations. It helps building owners lower their cooling costs, strengthen their cooling resiliency, and reduce their carbon emissions through affordable and spatially adaptable solutions. From a broader perspective, storing energy is imperative to a sustainable electric grid. Globally, an estimated potential for up to 2.8% of worldwide GHG emissions can be offset through full scale deployment of IHEX technology in building cooling. Beyond reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, cost-effective thermal storage can increase cooling resiliency by meeting cooling demand when the electric grid is down.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to catalyze development of IHEX technology by demonstrating high reliability for IHEX materials and establish high energy density, efficiency, and cooling resiliency for commercial-scale IHEX systems. IOC systems use miles of tubing to generate the necessary amount of surface area for heat transfer, which is costly and energy intensive, and their modular systems require significant space. This project will demonstrate that IHEX technology meets all the existing strengths of IOC technology, such as durability, while addressing potential economic concerns.  First, materials testing will be completed after a year?s worth of freeze/melt cycling on a prototype-scale system to indicate long IHEX system life. Second, the ability to use customizable storage tanks with high energy density will be demonstrated. Customizable, space-filling tanks will help IHEX technology eliminate the physical space constraints that have thwarted so many commercial projects. Third, a commercial-scale IHEX system will be used to derive a 20% energy efficiency improvement compared to IOC solutions and a low, $28/ton-hr cost. And finally, by working with our product end-users and industry, a 67% reduction in total cost of ownership compared to conventional cooling systems will be shown.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is well-known in modern chemistry that atoms and molecules can interact with each other in very strong ways to form new compounds and in weak ways that can be more readily reversed or disrupted.  For the latter case, however, even though the interactions are relatively weak, they can be very important.  Weak interactions allow geckos to climb walls, for instance, and have other demonstrable effects in nature, and in research laboratories.  This project investigates classes of chemical systems where weak interactions are crucial.  Such systems include compounds of the metal halide class that form solids stabilized by weak interactions, in some cases, but not in other cases.  The project is dedicated in part to elucidating why the solids of some metal halides are held together only by weak interactions in certain cases, but those weak interactions are overtaken by much more powerful forces in other metal halides.  The focus is on using mathematical and computational tools to further our understanding of how weak interactions transition to strong chemical bonding and, in turn, to better predict new and interesting materials properties.  This project will engage undergraduates and post-baccalaureate students in faculty-guided research and provide high school students from diverse backgrounds with mentored research experiences, and help them to acquire academic skills that are crucial for success in college.<br/><br/>This project under the guidance of Professor Kelling Donald at the University of Richmond (UR) aims to rationalize the bonding transition phenomenon in which chemical systems such as the binary dihalide mercury difluoride, move during the oligomerization process from weak van der Waals-type bonding in clusters to polar covalent inter-monomer bonding, eventually converging upon an ionic solid structure.  These studies are aimed at elucidating the fundamental basis and the evolution of this phenomenon where it exists among the halides, hydrides, and oxides of other heavy main group and d-block metals. The Donald group will also examine the role of relativistic effects in these phenomena. Another class of weak interactions under examination here is halogen bonding and other so-called sigma hole interactions, which continue to be implicated in biology and in the crystal engineering of organohalides.  A goal in this work is to advance understanding of that phenomenon for organic and inorganic halides, and other unusual bonding modes in systems such as fluxional organometallic and potential ouroboric ring compounds.  Professor Donald?s undergraduate students will perform the majority of the proposed work, and high school students from diverse backgrounds will participate in a research/mentoring program devised by Professor Donald, which will focus on attracting high school juniors from underrepresented groups and potential first-generation college students for (i) hands-on activities in research labs at UR, (ii) direct discussions with UR professionals on study skills, stress management, and other key competencies, and (iii) summer research fellowships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many cases, a Global Positioning System (GPS) or Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides the required localization and navigation capabilities for surface transportation. A GPS (or GNSS) mostly depends on satellites and radio communication, which are subject to various obstructions, such as high-rise buildings, walls and ceilings in garages and tunnels, and even thick cloud cover. Besides these factors, GPS devices are also subject to intentional threats, such as radio interference, spoofing on communications, data manipulation on transmitted messages, the jamming of GPS receiver channels, and disruptions to the GPS infrastructures. Existing cyber-resilient solutions against GPS interference, such as high-definition maps and Wi-Fi or cellular-based technologies, are either data-intensive and costly or susceptible to signal interference and limited by coverage area. Alternatively, low-cost in-vehicle sensors (including gyroscopes, accelerometers, steering angle sensors, inertial measurement units, odometers, and cameras), which are not susceptible to signal interference, can provide effective strategies for detecting threats as well as locating and navigating AVs. To establish cyber-resilient localization and navigation for autonomous driving in a roadway environment, the goal of this research is to develop sensor fusion approaches that combine outputs from low-cost in-vehicle sensors with those of onboard geographical information systems. <br/><br/>This proposed research addresses intentional and unintentional interference issues of GPS services in order to improve the operational safety of AVs. The project will first investigate and develop an approach to detect GPS interference (such as jamming, spoofing, and natural interference) by predicting and identifying vehicle states (including distance traveled, turning, and lane-change maneuvers) based on data from low-cost in-vehicle sensors and the onboard graphical information system. This initial research thrust adopts a three-step approach: (i) create different types of jamming and spoofing attacks using interference devices in both a laboratory and controlled real-world environment; (ii) generate attack and attack-free datasets in real-world scenarios for predicting and detecting vehicle state information; and (iii) develop a deep sensor fusion model and dynamic time warping algorithm to detect GPS interference using the generated attack and attack-free datasets. The second stage of the project will develop an integrated cyber-resilient navigation system using data from in-vehicle sensors and the onboard graphical information system to guide an AV towards its intended destination in a GPS-denied or GPS-compromised environment. This will involve a three-step process: (i) generate route creation and location information using the graphical information system; (ii) fuse steering angle and gyroscope data to identify lane changes and turning movements using deep fusion and dynamic time warping techniques developed in the first research thrust; and (iii) integrate graphical information and sensor-fusion data for localization and navigation when the GPS signal is compromised. The final stage of research will develop a proof-of-concept of the cyber-resilient localization and navigation system using a conventional vehicle with low-cost AV sensors. Broader impacts entail a transformation of autonomous vehicle operations under intentional and unintentional interference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This dataset will be used to train machine learning algorithms on a key set of remotely accessible features to predict range and battery health metrics.  The machine learning approach builds on a combination of tree-based ensemble models and linear models informed by physics-based experiments, and will eventually expand to other more advanced algorithms as appropriate.

These coatings often suffer from low-optical transmission, increased haze values, high coefficients of thermal expansion, and low-indices of refraction. This project develops UV-curable, inorganic films that exceeds the standards of currently used materials. This research project will focus on elucidating correlations between precursor formulation and film processing to control film thickness, refractive index, and optical transmission.  The proposed research objectives will reproducibly demonstrate materials with controlled optical performance that that meets or exceeds the current state-of-the-art and establish a pathway for manufacturers to achieve device miniaturization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This hinders our ability to diagnose the causes of changes in storminess and to plan for and address future storm impacts. With this project we will provide comprehensive storm data sets for the central Aleutian Islands that span the last two millennia, providing important context to current and future storm climates. A research cruise along Alaska?s Aleutian Islands will allow us to access remote fjords and collect a series of sediment cores and environmental measurements that have the potential to decipher the history of ancient storm events impacting the area. These storm reconstructions will improve our understanding of how intense storminess has changed in the Bering Sea and allow examination of the regional environmental factors that enhance or inhibit storm activity. The lessons learned from this research will be useful to the scientific community, planners, and local decision makers and will improve preparedness and resilience to future storm activity and coastal hazards.<br/><br/>Because the modern instrumental record of storminess in the Bering Sea is limited, we know little about the variability of intense storminess prior to the last few decades. To address this gap in knowledge we will develop reconstructions of extreme storms over the last few millennia from coarse-grained event beds in deep coastal basins along the north coast of the Aleutians. Using sedimentological, geophysical and numerical modeling techniques, coupled with local instrumentation (wave, current, pressure sensors), and the collection of local oral and written storm narratives we will; 1) develop reconstructions of coarse-grained event beds over several millennia, 2) measure real-time storm-related coastal processes to determine thresholds for event bed deposition and provide National Weather Service data for real-time storm and flood impact forecasting, 3) engage with local communities to develop a chronology of historical storm affects, and 4) differentiate other mechanisms of event bed deposition and develop a record of relative sea-level change and potentially great earthquakes and tsunamis. This research is tightly coupled with a field- and lab-based education plan focused on building coastal science literacy to support informed decision-making.

The proposed framework will also incentivize additional cybersecurity scholars to turn their research or teaching materials into case studies. These case studies will be attributable, which will expand societal and community impacts and also positively impact scholars? research reputations via citations and thus enhance their academic progression.<br/><br/>In this project, the team proposes to develop a simple yet flexible framework named SAGA (Security Arxiv-Github-kAggle), where scholars can easily create cybersecurity case studies related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). For example, these case studies might illustrate the use of machine learning to detect malicious activities in social media or detecting spam/phishing emails using classification. Furthermore, by adopting the notion of ?citation? from the academic world and implementing it using three public platforms (arXiv, Github, Kaggle), the SAGA framework allows the developed case studies to be found easily and shared across the cybersecurity community and allows the authors of case studies to be appropriately recognized for their efforts. This attribution is intended to encourage scholars? participation in creating and sharing such cybersecurity case studies. Finally, the project proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed cybersecurity case studies in improving students? learning of cybersecurity concepts and skills.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

The mission of the CQT is to collaborate with industry and government stakeholders to identify compelling needs and challenges in quantum technologies, and then develop novel solutions to address these opportunities. Quantum technologies are governed by the physics of sub-atomic particles and have relevance to computing, sensing, imaging, metrology, communications, and cryptography. Because of their wide-ranging applicability, quantum technologies have the potential to be transformative, with uses in intelligence, financial security, computing, medicine, and navigation. Society has entered the second quantum revolution, but it is still in its infancy, and the nascent quantum industry requires significant fundamental research to mature novel technologies. In partnership with industrial members, the CQT researchers will use their expertise in quantum science and engineering to develop and transfer foundational knowledge into industry-friendly quantum devices, systems, and algorithms with enhanced functionality and performance. Additionally, the CQT will help train the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers to support the development of a critically needed quantum workforce. Students will not only conduct Center research, but also help writing project reports, present at biannual meetings, and interact with industry and government members. Finally, the CQT will leverage established programs at each of the four universities to engage and support students traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>The overarching vision of the CQT is to bring together multidisciplinary experts in academia, industry, and government in a self-sustaining, collaborative venture facilitating the transition of fundamental research discoveries in quantum science and engineering to novel, commercial-ready technologies. Specifically, it will focus on three significant industrial and government interests: quantum computing (including simulation and algorithm development), quantum sensing, and quantum communications. Purdue University will contribute these areas using its expertise in quantum algorithm development and machine learning, quantum devices and materials, quantum nanophotonics, atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) and condensed-matter physics, and quantum chemistry. Because of the wide applicability of quantum technologies, the relevant industry base is broad. The technologies developed in the CQT may save energy, speed up computation, enhance national security and defense, and innovate health care.  A variety of world-class facilities are available on the Purdue University campus to support the CQT. These include the Birck Nanotechnology Center, which houses a 25,000 sq. ft. clean room and has a multitude of experimental capabilities including nanofabrication, materials and surface characterization and microscopy, a quantum design physical property measurement system, and optical characterization laboratories. The Physics Department also houses a crystal growth facility, various portable radioactive sources to test for radiation fidelity, machine and electronic shops, and a helium re-capture and re-liquification system, which significantly reduces costs of running cryogenic equipment. CQT will also leverage several existing mechanisms at Purdue University for incorporating students traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines into the quantum research, including the Minority Engineering Program, the Science Diversity Office, and the Summer Research Opportunities Program, a diversity recruitment opportunity aimed at preparing high-achieving undergraduates for graduate study.<br/>degree.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project advances MetPy to address some current limitations in supported data formats, scalability, and run-time performance; it makes MetPy more suitable for working on much larger datasets, frequently encountered in climate science and ensemble-based modeling studies. Addressing these areas allows MetPy to continue to be a powerful tool for Python users in the atmospheric sciences for both small and large datasets. When equipped with modern and well-engineered tools, researchers will be able to better utilize the large amounts of data available in a more time-efficient way.<br/><br/>This project has three main goals: enabling efficient access to big and small datasets, enabling access to cloud-based datasets, and creating training resources for using MetPy with big data.  In tackling these challenges, the project is creating a benchmark suite for MetPy, to quantify the current performance of MetPy in important workflows as well as the performance improvements that occur as a result of further development. Using performance profiling tools, bottlenecks in MetPy are identified and optimized using Python performance tools like Cython and Numba.  MetPy is also being refactored to work better with the Dask library, which provides facilities for distributed computing in Python and would allow MetPy to work more effectively with large datasets.  The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has made GRIB (GRIdded Binary) its standard format for gridded model output, and BUFR (Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological data) the standard format to encode meteorological observational data.

IsoDAR is a novel, pure anti-electron-neutrino source that, when paired with a large hydrogen-based, underground detector, allows for state-of-the-art Beyond-Standard-Model searches for sterile neutrinos and non-standard neutrino interactions. While the standard electron, muon, and tau neutrinos (and antineutrinos) interact with matter through two forces (the weak force and gravity), sterile neutrinos, if they exist, might interact only through gravity. Searches for light sterile neutrinos with mass on the order of one electron Volt are motivated by observed anomalies in several experiments.  A positive result from IsoDAR that could explain these anomalies would transform the field. <br/><br/>A centerpiece Broader Impact for this award is the possibility for developing an isotope production cyclotron. A modest redesign of the IsoDAR accelerator can be applied to the production of medical isotopes at levels that are hundreds to thousands of times higher than present production facilities, potentially saving many lives.  For workforce training, the groups are committed to bringing under-represented groups into the STEM ?eld and plan to integrate undergraduates into the IsoDAR hardware and development projects. A main part of undergraduate participation is the summer research programs, which include a very successful Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program.<br/><br/><br/>The IsoDAR cyclotron and neutrino production target are creative, original, and transformative.  To meet the physics goals, the cyclotron will capture, accelerate, and extract 5 mA of H+2 (10 mA of protons), which is an order of magnitude beyond current cyclotrons. The novel targeting, cooling, and neutrino production, besides producing an unprecedented rate of electron antineutrinos for experimentation, will also pave new ground for accelerator and target technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They also impact plant defenses and build soil quality. The functioning of AM fungi varies tremendously between species and isolates. As a result, studies of AM fungi can improve management of agriculture, grasslands and forests. Progress in understanding the importance and optimal management of AM fungi depends upon tests of AM fungi cultures. Unfortunately, few researchers have the expertise or facilities necessary to develop or maintain their own AM fungal cultures, and therefore the availability of cultures can limit scientific progress. This project will enable the study of this important group of soil fungi through support of a culture collection called the International culture collection of (Vesicular) Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM).  This is the largest culture collection of this type of fungi in the world and includes hundreds of individual isolates.  This collection will enable advancement of knowledge on AM fungal biology, genetics, ecology, and taxonomy, as well as applications of AM fungi for commercial purposes. This project will also promote the exploration of science by the private sector and by students of all ages and abilities. The project will develop modules on experimentation using INVAM cultures that support the K-12 Next Generation Life Science Standards. Standards related to plant growth, soil health and the importance of biodiversity can all be supported by the collection.<br/><br/>INVAM has been the largest provider of cultures to the scientific community and has been the primary resource for identification of AM fungal species. INVAM maintains the largest number of reference cultures, cultures that are linked to a library of voucher specimens and to species descriptions. These reference cultures are a critical resource for the development and testing of new approaches to environmental sequencing, a potentially powerful method to study patterns of AM fungi in the field. The project will maximize the value of the reference cultures through sequencing efforts. The core mission of INVAM is to preserve accessions and provide living cultures to the user community. INVAM also provides comprehensive information on collection protocols and policies, methodology, taxonomy, and a searchable database for accessions and active/stored cultures via the INVAM website. Users include teachers and students from high schools through graduate programs at universities, researchers, and industry clients. Stocks include representatives of 95 AM fungal species, and high value germ plasm including strains used for genome projects and strains known to be highly effective as mycorrhizal symbionts. Dr. Joseph Morton, who built and curated INVAM since 1990, retired in 2017. This project secures the future of the INVAM collections by moving it to the University of Kansas.  The move occurs in phases through the duration of the project to ensure culture viability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although most human designs of propulsors such as wings or propellers are rigid, natural propulsors are generally flexible. Propulsive efficiencies of natural flyers and swimmers are typically higher than human-designed vehicles of similar weight and dimensions. However, attempts to emulate flexible animal designs have met with limited success. Recent comparative animal studies have demonstrated startlingly consistent patterns of bending kinematics among a broad diversity of swimmers and flyers constructed from very different materials and of very different physical dimensions. These patterns encompass cilia to whale flukes and fluid regimes from water to air. This project will use computational fluid dynamics and particle image velocimetry to measure fluid velocities to investigate the mechanical and fluid dynamic details that enable high force production by flexible natural propulsors.  K-12 outreach activities are planned at the universities and at the Cabrillo Aquarium in San Pedro, CA and undergraduate and graduate student involvement is core to the research project. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a set of design rules that govern force production by flexible propulsors. To achieve this goal, experiments and computations will be used to investigate: a) bending kinematics of propulsors as control surfaces of vorticity, pressure fields and thrust, b) the hydrodynamic basis of vortex-vortex interactions that generate pressure fields and thrust and c) the advantageous limits of bending kinematics. Each of these will be investigated using a combination of experiments (particle image velocimetry) with natural organisms and computational fluid dynamic models. The results of this project will define the necessary design criteria that enable performance enhancement by bending propulsors of different types and across a range of fluid regimes. While contributing to interpretation of the natural world, the results will also contribute to novel engineered designs ranging from biomedical applications (cilia) to vehicle design (swimming, flight).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, our knowledge of past storminess is limited to the last few decades, so we know little about past variability in extreme storms. This hinders our ability to diagnose the causes of changes in storminess and to plan for and address future storm impacts. With this project we will provide comprehensive storm data sets for the central Aleutian Islands that span the last two millennia, providing important context to current and future storm climates. A research cruise along Alaska?s Aleutian Islands will allow us to access remote fjords and collect a series of sediment cores and environmental measurements that have the potential to decipher the history of ancient storm events impacting the area. These storm reconstructions will improve our understanding of how intense storminess has changed in the Bering Sea and allow examination of the regional environmental factors that enhance or inhibit storm activity. The lessons learned from this research will be useful to the scientific community, planners, and local decision makers and will improve preparedness and resilience to future storm activity and coastal hazards.<br/><br/>Because the modern instrumental record of storminess in the Bering Sea is limited, we know little about the variability of intense storminess prior to the last few decades. To address this gap in knowledge we will develop reconstructions of extreme storms over the last few millennia from coarse-grained event beds in deep coastal basins along the north coast of the Aleutians. Using sedimentological, geophysical and numerical modeling techniques, coupled with local instrumentation (wave, current, pressure sensors), and the collection of local oral and written storm narratives we will; 1) develop reconstructions of coarse-grained event beds over several millennia, 2) measure real-time storm-related coastal processes to determine thresholds for event bed deposition and provide National Weather Service data for real-time storm and flood impact forecasting, 3) engage with local communities to develop a chronology of historical storm affects, and 4) differentiate other mechanisms of event bed deposition and develop a record of relative sea-level change and potentially great earthquakes and tsunamis. This research is tightly coupled with a field- and lab-based education plan focused on building coastal science literacy to support informed decision-making. Extreme storms endanger Alaskan Native coastal communities already at risk from increased flooding and erosion and threaten critical infrastructure and access to subsistence resources. A collaboration with the Qawalangin Tribe of Unalaska will serve to build synergy between scientists, local stakeholders, and community residents. Tribal participation in the planning and carrying out of research activities, the production of a professional outreach video/photo blog, and design of a portable educational exhibit and accompanying curriculum materials will provide many opportunities for meaningful engagement and the promotion of STEM fields to under-represented groups. The research will also incorporate undergraduate and graduate students with targeted efforts to increase the representation of Alaska Natives, women, minorities, and people with disabilities in STEM fields.

Dormant bacterial cells have been linked to the failure of antibiotic therapy, food-related outbreaks, and environmental disease transmission. Despite the prevalence and biological significance of dormant states, several aspects of these critical phenomenon remain obscure. In this research project, the regulatory networks controlling bacterial dormancy and environmental conditions driving this phenomenon will be investigated. In this research project, Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, will be used as a model system to study the role of a transcription factor, ToxR, in dormancy. However, the experimental approaches and potential findings will be applicable to numerous microorganisms that form these types of dormant cells. Results from this proposal may have major public health and economic implications as these cells are typically resistant to antibiotics and are a major source of food and water contamination. A major integrated education initiative, the Synergy Scholars Program, will foster the retention of underrepresented students in Biomedical Sciences at University of Central Florida, a large Hispanic-Serving Institution by creating a supportive community that revolves around the mentoring of scholars. A bridge program for students from the Universidad Interamericana de Puerto Rico (Aguadilla) to perform research at UCF in areas covered in this proposal and an updated course on ?Bacterial Stress Responses? at UCF that will include topics from this proposal such as bacterial dormancy will be implemented.<br/><br/>This research project focuses on the convergent regulatory networks controlling bacterial dormancy and how diverse environmental conditions drive this phenomenon. Aside from sporulation, there are two major states of dormant bacterial cells, persisters and viable but non-culturable (VBNC). Persister cells are typically selected after antibiotic exposure, whereas VBNC cells arise in natural environments due to exposure to biotic and abiotic factors. In spite of these differences, there are major overlaps between the two states. In this research project, the hypothesis that VBNC entry and persister cell formation are initiated by distinct stimuli but converge into common regulatory pathways will be tested using Vibrio cholerae as a model system and the master regulator ToxR. The main hypothesis will be tested in three independent but complementary aims: aim 1 will address how common aquatic abiotic and biotic drivers synergistically regulate VBNC in a ToxR-dependent manner via the stringent response; aim 2 will define the roles of ToxR and the cell envelope stress response in the regulation of persister cell formation; and, aim 3 will examine the role of a ToxR-regulated small RNA in the convergence of these dormant phenotypes. Overall, the use of genetic tools in a tractable model system and the integration of data on the regulatory networks and environmental conditions will provide insight into the dynamics of dormant cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Certain PFAS chemicals have been detected in the blood of more than 95% of the US population. Soil largely contributes to the quality of groundwater and crops, which are potential human exposure pathways for these chemicals. The challenge of dealing with PFAS contamination results from their chemical structure that leads to strong resistance to biological degradation in the environment. However, thermal processes such as forest fires are known to induce physical and chemical changes of PFAS chemicals in soil. The goal of this CAREER project is to understand the stability and decomposition of PFAS chemicals in soil during thermal treatment. A deeper understanding of these processes is necessary for the development of thermal technologies to clean up soils contaminated by PFAS for the protection of human and ecological health. Successful completion of this research will enable scientists to accurately predict decomposition products of PFAS in various thermal processes. Additional benefits to society result from the training of engineering undergraduates and enhanced learning through participation in hands-on experiments in soil chemistry and physics. Further benefits will accrue from the dissemination of results to the public, remediation professionals, and other stakeholders through outreach, conference presentations, and journal publications. This project is jointly funded by the CBET Environmental Engineering program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to elucidate transformation mechanisms of PFAS in soil during thermal treatment. PFAS reaction pathways at elevated temperatures will be identified through stepwise experiments assessing the thermal treatment of various PFAS classes under different gas phases in various soils and reference soil components. Results will be used to determine the combined effects of soil properties, PFAS molecular structure, and ambient atmosphere on degradation pathways; information critical  to assessing thermal treatment as a potential remediation method for PFAS-contaminated soils. A novel aspect of this research arises from the use of an innovative identification approach based on continuously interleaving scans at low and high collision energies of time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Successful completion of this research will yield critical insight into the thermal stability of various classes of PFAS, enhanced understanding of the fate of PFAS in the soil environment during forest fires, and elucidation of mechanisms of thermal decomposition of PFAS. This knowledge is potentially transformative because the high thermal stability of PFAS is an implicit assumption in current environmental fate and transport models. The educational objectives of this project are focused on advancing STEM understanding through the involvement of undergraduate students in well-designed projects. Students will apply knowledge learned in class to address interesting and relevant real-world problems.

The use of existing quantum devices already extends beyond physics to materials, chemistry, optimization, and machine learning among other fields. However, this grant will create quantum algorithms for a new area of application, namely that of critical infrastructure engineering, which includes power transmission grids, to ultimately support risk?informed decisions when resources are limited. As quantifying infrastructure performance is notoriously challenging today due to the increasing complexity of engineered systems, this grant responds to various calls for research and implementation from the National Academy of Engineering and the National Science Foundation, by exploiting the emerging advantages of quantum information processing over classical computing. The execution of this grant is possible through an interdisciplinary team spanning civil and infrastructure engineering, algorithmic logic, algebraic optimization, and quantum physics. The team?s disciplinary diversity also facilitates broad training, outreach, and dissemination beyond the primary field of infrastructure safety to tangibly advance quantum computing applications as anticipated by the National Quantum Initiative Act signed recently into law. The team will also seed a new workforce of algorithmicists for engineering and science, through funded graduate and undergraduate students, while reaching out to quantum technology enthusiasts, industry professionals, and high school students. <br/><br/>Quantifying critical infrastructure safety, reliability and resilience is essential to inform operations and steer interventions under uncertainty with limited resources. However, most methods to quantify such network metrics rely on numerical simulation and heuristic optimization today. While these approaches do offer insights to infrastructure stakeholders, they are unable to handle, in a principled way, challenging conditions such as rare?event reliability estimation or optimal restoration decisions for increasingly complex infrastructure systems. The team addresses these challenges with various novel strategies for infrastructure safety assessment. First, instead of adopting widely used numerical simulation for network reliability estimation, the team focuses on exact methods that count system configurations, as enabled by powerful symbolic logic tensor networks (TNs). These TNs help expand the size frontier of solvable problems while offering quality guarantees. Second, to leverage relentless progress on quantum hardware, the team will transform TN algorithms into their quantum versions to count reliable network configurations and search for optimal restoration sequences. Third, the team will test algorithms, classical and quantum, relative to best?performing methods, across different quantum hardware platforms, simulation tools, input resolution levels, and infrastructure topologies, including realistic power transmission grids. This testing campaign will reveal the settings for quantum circuits that best impact computation time, solution quality and other features that support infrastructure safety assessment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether there are Roombas cleaning the floor or Kiva robots delivering parts in warehouses, the robots should be able to avoid collisions while successfully completing their tasks. However, despite the maturity of existing motion planning techniques and the recent rise of learning and big data techniques, mobile robots still lack the decision making ability of humans. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will develop techniques for efficient and socially intelligent multi-robot navigation, shaping the next generation of mobile robots that can reason about how their actions influence the other agents present in the scene and act accordingly, much like humans do. The resulting advances will facilitate the successful deployment of ""thinking"" mobile robots that can be seamlessly integrated into our homes and workspaces. This research spans across different areas, including motion planning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. With its interdisciplinary nature and relevance for modern technologies, it is ideal for inspiring the next generation of students and exposing the broader community to STEM areas couched in progressive applications in robotics and AI. The project includes integrated educational, research, and outreach activities for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, promoting a high level of participation by women and underrepresented minorities, and developing new courses and updated curricula related to robotics.<br/><br/>This project will introduce a human-inspired paradigm shift in the design of multi-robot navigation algorithms. Humans know when they have to be polite and yield to others and when to take decisive actions, efficiently performing complex navigation tasks without collisions. The objective of this project is to enable such behavior on mobile robots by leveraging publicly available human-human interaction data and our own human-robot interaction experiments along with coupling motion planning with learning techniques. Specifically, the project will focus on two two inter-related research thrusts that will lead to i) new algorithms that take advantage of human trajectory datasets to learn what controls humans take in different interaction scenarios; ii) new approaches that enhance existing local navigation planners with the learned controls to enable human-like decision making; iii) a reinforcement learning framework for multi-robot navigation that generalizes robot navigation policies to unknown interactions scenarios; iv) new datasets involving interactions between humans and robots, and subsequently v) new algorithms for multi-robot navigation in human-populated environments. This work will be evaluated both in simulation and on real robots, and related algorithms and datasets will be made publicly available to facilitate further research and exploration by the robotics and AI community. If successful, this project will shape the next generation of indoor mobile robots that can enrich our quality of life and work, and has the potential to significantly benefit society through its integrated education plan.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).

At the same time, public concern over privacy is increasing, making it more difficult to collect reliable data. Improved use of government data by a wide range of users has potential to improve research as well as day-to-day operations at a variety of levels, from local to national and global. Government data can also foster innovation, providing opportunities for small companies based on large-scale data analysis that are increasingly reserved for large organizations capable of gathering their own data (often in ways that raise privacy concerns.)  We are running a 2-day workshop to identify challenges and explore mechanisms (technical, legal, and procedural) to enable greater use of privacy-sensitive data held by government agencies.<br/><br/>Privacy technology has experienced great advances over the past decade. Breakthroughs such as fully homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, federated and split learning, and advances in secure multiparty computation have great promise to enable broader public use of data, while maintaining individual privacy.  While there have been some successes, there are many applications where there is a significant gap between what technology offers, data needs of users, and policies and procedures to ensure privacy.  This includes best practices as well as research and policy challenges that limit effective use of data.  This workshop explore these concerns, highlighting new research challenges based on actual user needs for government data. This covers research in underlying technologies that address real-world challenges, as well as research in policy and business models to enable use of technology in ways that provide appropriate levels of sharing and protection for privacy-sensitive data. The outcome will be a report identifying unmet needs of data users, issues limiting broader use of government data, and technologies and policies that show promise of bridging these gaps.

The overall goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant is to develop analytical and experimental tools to evaluate the dynamics of organisms capable of extreme accelerations and applying these principles towards designing a jumping micro-scale robot, using click beetles as a case study organism. Click beetles belong to a group of organisms that use latches and springs to amplify their muscle power output and circumvent the same actuation limitations that currently cripple micro-robots. The current state of the art in modeling such organisms lack the proper dynamic considerations that would allow engineers to implement the appropriate principles to engineered systems. The techniques developed in this project are beneficial to both biology and engineering. The modeling approach creates a framework to analyze a diverse group of organisms that use springs and latches to move extremely fast. These bioinspired principles enable a design framework for micro-robots to direct power towards the robot?s components for locomotion and dissipate energy elsewhere to prevent mechanical failure. The bioinspired nature of this research makes it an excellent candidate for outreach. Outreach activities include workshops and summer camps for first-generation undergraduates and low income and unrepresented high and middle school students to encourage them to pursue higher education, especially in STEM-related fields. <br/><br/>This work will advance the fundamental knowledge of the dynamics of ultra-fast locomotion in biology and bio-inspired systems. Most of the literature studying these locomotion strategies in biological systems focus on observing the kinematics only or use overly simplified models for the dynamics. The modeling approach, namely mobility power flow provides insights into how an organism uses and augments muscle power output and how it transmits and dissipates this power for agile locomotion while mitigating damage. In the planned modeling approach, click beetles or micro-robots are represented as a global structure composed of substructures on elastic and rigid substrates to model various environments. Expressions for power transmission and dissipation through each substructure and at the junctions will be studied through mechanical mobility functions, which can be derived analytically or measured directly in experiments. The models and experimentation techniques will create a new pathway to study and design ultra-fast and small dynamic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those networks are composed of numerous intense bonds, including those between family members, friends, co-workers, neighbors, and many others. People are fundamentally interested in knowing where others sit in their real-world social networks. Discovering ?degrees of separation? and knowing who is especially well-connected consumes significant attention. The cognitive demands of tracking relationships in such networks, and calibrating one?s behavior accordingly, are likely to have been a driving force in human brain evolution. Additionally, the human capacity for understanding social networks is central to many aspects of everyday functioning, including interpersonal trust, empathy, and social influence. Yet, little is known about how the human brain encodes the structure of the social networks in which it is embedded, or how this knowledge shapes downstream mental processing and behavior. This project seeks to understand how knowledge of others? positions in one?s social network shapes thoughts, feelings, and behavior. The research considers individual differences in attunement to this information, and how context shapes representations of social networks. The related educational and training components of the project include the creation of mentored research and professional development opportunities for underrepresented students from community colleges and the development of a new graduate course focused on advanced methods in social neuroscience. <br/><br/>This project integrates approaches from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and social network analysis to illuminate how knowledge of social networks shapes affect, behavior, and cognition. Several studies examine the social networks of a series of bounded communities. Subsets of community members complete behavioral and/or neuroimaging experiments that seek to delineate (1) the behavioral, cognitive, and affective consequences of knowledge of others? positions in one?s social network, and (2) how the mental representation of such knowledge varies across contexts and individuals. One specific focus is on how perceptions of distance in social networks and network centrality influences prosocial behavior. The results of the research will inform broader efforts to better understand social influence and interpersonal trust. Understanding these phenomena will also inform efforts in the national security community to mitigate the targeted spread of misinformation in social networks.

Reliable detection of these diseases at an early stage has the potential for significantly improving disease outcomes, by reducing the health impact of lung diseases and the costs associated with the treatment. Briefly, 14 million Americans are currently estimated to have Pulmonary Function Test (PFT)-diagnosed COPD, while >16 million subjects are expected to have PFT-undiagnosed COPD leading to the first or initial diagnosis at the severe stages. Currently no accurate and early lung health assessments exist, representing a vital healthcare gap - especially for young children, elderly and subjects with chronic conditions, as lung diagnostics such as PFT require patient compliance and CT, PET etc., have significant risk for these subjects. With >16 million cases of PFT-undiagnosed COPD in the United States alone, a new lung health screening diagnostic test will address the ?invisible? epidemic of COPD and help monitor impact of exposure to first- and secondhand- smoke, e-cig vapors and air pollutants. Early more frequent lung health screening will allow timely intervention and limit significant health care costs.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will accelerate development and commercialization of a lung health multiplex point of care test (xPOCT) for early diagnosis and intervention of COPD. The POCT is supported by proof-of-concept pre-clinical data and human subject validation of a prognostic biomarker for delivering on first-in-class RAPID home-based and POC Lung Health Diagnostics (LHDx) for predicting initiation and progression of COPD-emphysema. The goal is to develop an effective, non-invasive and rapid LHDx for early more frequent screening and diagnosis of COPD-emphysema, commonly missed by current standard-of-care diagnostics. This project has the following objectives: (1) prototype engineering and standardization of the specificity and sensitivity of the home-based and POC LHDx platform technology; (2) validation of the diagnostic assay specificity and sensitivity for evaluating disease prognosis; and (3) development of a lab validation assay with custom software for disease severity analysis and initiate regulatory approval for commercialization of the home-based RAPID and POC LHDx. The Phase I project will address the unmet need for identification of individuals that are at-risk and highly susceptible to developing COPD for prognosis-based early intervention. The  outcome would be development of a novel, non-invasive LHDx for quantifying COPD-emphysema initiation and progression for tailored intervention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many volcanoes that pose great risks to large populations are well studied and highly monitored with scientific instruments, but there is still a fundamental lack of understanding of many basic aspects of the Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira systems. This investigation will improve our understanding of these systems by focusing on (1) how magma forms beneath the two volcanoes, (2) how deeply and for how long magma is stored beneath the volcanoes before eruption, (3) what triggers eruptions to occur on the flanks of the volcanoes, in and near populated areas, and (4) how fast magma moves towards the surface during an eruption and how much warning time people would have in advance of an eruption. In addition to these aspects focused on hazards, this project will investigate the source of the carbon that is released as carbon dioxide by these volcanoes. Large amounts of carbon are likely stored in solid minerals inside the Earth beneath thick, old continental crust like that in East Africa, and when the crust gets pulled apart by rifting as in the East African Rift, the carbon contributes to magma formation. Nyiragongo is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide gas of any volcano worldwide, and better understanding the connection between carbon in minerals and magma formation beneath this volcano will help us better understand the Earth?s deep carbon cycle. Much of the research for this project will be conducted by graduate students at the University of Oregon and University of Wyoming as part of their scientific training. Collaboration with scientists at the Goma Volcano Observatory in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will include periodic videoconferences to share research results important for volcanic hazards monitoring. Public engagement will include a National Geographic Explorer?s Blog and several short articles for a general audience on volcanic hazards at Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira and release of carbon dioxide from volcanoes.<br/><br/>In detail, the primary goals of this project are (1) to understand the time-integrated effects of lithospheric metasomatism on magma generation beneath Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira, and (2) to use the results as the starting point for a source-to-surface investigation of the plumbing systems, magma storage timescales, eruption triggering processes, and magma ascent rates for these volcanoes. Although these volcanoes are only 15 km apart, their eruption behavior and the types of lava they emit are profoundly different, with Nyiragongo erupting some of the most unusual lava types found anywhere on Earth. To understand the roles of lithospheric mantle and metasomatic veins as magma sources, we will use existing major and trace element and isotopic data together with new data on volatile contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions to establish parental melt compositions and source lithologies. Our data and modeling approach will also provide important constraints on parental magma CO2 and S concentrations and magma fluxes for each volcano. Our proposed work will use existing tephra and lava samples and will focus on the many parasitic cones and tuff rings on the flanks of Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira, as these erupt more primitive compositions than the volcanoes? central vents. For investigating the plumbing systems, we will use (1) melt inclusion volatile data to determine crystallization depths, (2) U-series mineral isochrons to determine crystal and magma residence times, (3) mineral zoning and diffusion chronometry to identify recharge and mixing processes that may trigger eruptions and yield precursory seismic signals, and (4) diffusive loss of H from melt inclusions to infer magma ascent rates during eruption, which likely influence explosivity. Our overarching goal is to produce geologically well-grounded, state-of-the-art geochemical and petrological data that improves our understanding of these volcanic systems and thereby improves hazard assessment models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With growing water scarcity from the lack of natural rainfall and depleted groundwater tables, the need to maintain agricultural wells and agricultural production is dramatic. The proposed subsurface irrigation technology will reduce irrigated water by 50% over drip irrigation.  This could enable significant reduction in water use and allow the groundwater tables to recover and perform as water reservoirs during drought years. It potentially can raise farm yields, improve weed control for organic farmers, and promote better uptake of fertilizers - thereby minimizing the pollution of underground aquifers. The proposed technology also can lead to energy cost reductions and increased flexibility in scheduling power usage. At a systems level, it offers a new paradigm for a resilient and sustainable irrigation. <br/><br/>The proposed research is focused on the development of an easy-to-use moisture plume simulation calculator that enables farmers to self-analyze how their soil type will react when installing a virtual water table irrigation system.

The predictions will be compared with more comprehensive industry-standard hydrological model predictions and also with the experimentally collected moisture data from the field.

Most networks change over time and are often called temporal or dynamic networks. In this project, a framework for modeling and analyzing dynamic networks that change continuously over time will be developed, even though the networks may only be periodically observed. This framework advances the interdisciplinary field of network science along with the computer and information sciences by developing models to separate the underlying dynamics of the networks from the times at which the networks are observed. The framework can be applied to analyze dynamic network data in many scientific disciplines and in public health applications, including networks of face-to-face interactions between people, which can help scientists better understand the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This project advances education in network science by creating a curriculum for instruction of dynamic networks at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The project also trains new graduate and undergraduate students, including female students from the University of Toledo's ACM-W chapter, in interdisciplinary data science research. Finally, the project develops and integrates methods for analyzing dynamic networks into the open-source DyNetworkX Python package to reach others who could use them in impactful ways.<br/><br/>Temporal dynamics in networks are known to provide crucial information about the underlying complex systems being modeled by the networks. While significant advances have been made towards understanding the structure of static networks, dynamics are usually incorporated in an ad-hoc manner by creating discrete time snapshots aggregated over some arbitrary time period, primarily for convenience of analysis. The goal of this project is to develop a unified framework for model-based analysis of dynamic networks using continuous-time models that can be applied to both discrete- and continuous-time dynamic network data. Towards this goal, the research team will target five specific aims: 1) learning continuous-time network models from aggregated counts of relational events over time, 2) creating Hawkes process-based generative models for timestamped events with durations, 3) developing kernel smoothing approaches for analyzing dynamic networks, 4) modeling different types of measurement error in dynamic network data, and 5) creating time- and memory-efficient dynamic graph data structures to enable analysis of large dynamic networks with high temporal resolution. Dynamics of networks are given minimal coverage in current network science curricula and textbooks. The model-based analysis techniques to be developed in this project build upon fundamental network theory and empirical observations about real networks and are thus ideal for integration into a typical graduate or undergraduate network science course. The investigator will develop a publicly-available curriculum for instruction on dynamic network representations, models, and analysis methods. The results of this project will provide a glimpse of the possibilities enabled by continuous-time network models and guide future research and education efforts on dynamic networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the domestic production of natural gas is a central pillar in the transition to a cleaner energy economy, a detrimental by-product is contaminated wastewater, known as produced water, which comes to the surface in large volumes mixed with the gas. In regions such as the Marcellus Basin, the largest natural gas reserve in the United States, the only viable option is to truck this water long distances to disposal wells, where it is re-injected, for a cost that comprises large portions of the operational budget. By developing a new technology for the treatment and re-use of this water at the well-site, this project aims to provide a low-cost, environmentally sustainable solution. Doing so would reduce water management costs as much as 50%, lowering gas production costs, and conserving billions gallons of water through re-use that would otherwise be lost.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project aims to develop a new type of filtration membrane technology capable of removing critical contaminants from produced water, while providing the required durability, minimal footprint, mobility, and feasible cost to enable commercial water recycling for natural gas producers.

This project focuses on a new type of ultra-durable silicon membrane that combines the filtration ability and low-cost of polymeric membranes with the resilience of ceramic. Through the strategic manipulation of the membrane fabrication approach, including catalyst deposition and chemical etching process parameters, efforts will focus on reducing pore size and increasing pore density in the membrane.

In addition to commercial potential and scientific knowledge, the vision is that this work will also help catalyze a new generation of ?quantum first? software developers, and this will be critical in maintaining our nation?s competitiveness in the 21st century.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to address a key challenge facing the current generation of quantum computers: execution quality. Each operation on a quantum computer incurs some error due to various types of noise that are present in and around these delicate systems.  These errors accumulate, and this limits the size of program that can be successfully run. This in turn dramatically reduces the already limited set of problems that can be solved on a quantum computer. While noise characteristics of a quantum device are defined by the underlying hardware technology and device architecture, there are ways to improve execution quality through software by identifying or estimating errors and compensating for them. In fact, there is evidence from the literature that such improvements can improve fidelity of the execution by 10 times or more. In this project, a quantum compiler & circuit optimizer software product is developed that will incorporate known optimization methods, quantum error correction techniques, plus develop new approaches. The resulting software will match a quantum program with the quantum computer that will provide the best execution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current drug development process is lengthy, inefficient, and expensive. It costs about $1.8 billion and takes 12-15 years to launch a single drug. Approximately 92% of the drugs that passed preclinical testing failed in subsequent human trials, highlighting the lack of adequate preclinical testing tools to generate predictive data. Failure to detect the drug-induced toxicity to the vital human organs in clinical trials often leads to market withdrawal of the drug after launch, which causes enormous financial losses to the drug manufacturer and also negative physical and mental effects for patients. The proposed technology will significantly improve drug safety, increase the efficiency and lower the cost of drug development by providing more reliable and clinically relevant drug testing results in a high-throughput fashion. This technology can also provide patient-specific tissues for critical biomedical research (e.g. disease modeling) and in vivo therapeutic applications, providing a viable solution to diseases without no cures or effective treatment yet.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a high-throughput biofabrication platform that is compatible with the high-throughput screening (HTS) systems widely used for drug screening and assay development. Currently, the key bottleneck for traditional microfabrication strategies and mainstream nozzle-based bioprinters is the lack of scalability and throughput to accommodate scalable manufacturing necessary in HTS systems. With the growing adoption of 3D biomimetic human tissue models in the pharmaceutical industry, there is a critical need for advanced manufacturing systems that enable rapid and streamlined tissue fabrication methods that are compatible with already established HTS platforms for preclinical toxicity testing of potential drug candidates. The proposed project will develop a parallel optical projection-based 3D bioprinting platform for direct manufacturing of 3D tissues within multiwell plates commonly used in the HTS systems. Implementation of the proposed 3D bioprinting system will permit subsequent in situ drug screening or assay testing directly within the wells and drastically improve biofabrication workflow efficiencies for the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical research community. This bioprinter will serve as a powerful instrument for the mass production of 3D tissue models at the industrial scale to advance drug discovery and assay development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Is it better to give up farming, move to an urban area, become a wage-laborer, leave family behind, and sever ties with one?s birth community? How do these decisions affect the wellbeing of families? This project examines how small-scale farmers navigate these decisions. Specifically, the researchers collect new data to assess whether the reliance on family versus formal institutions for social support is influenced by household economic decisions, and what impact this has on the wellbeing of rural families when faced with the dual challenge of increasing environmental variability and globalization. The project provides scientific and STEM-field research experience to undergraduate and graduate students and professional training to postdoctoral researchers, as well as valuable information for non-governmental organizations and policy makers.<br/><br/>This research provides a novel test of economic, sociological, and cultural anthropological theories to address the extent to which opportunities associated with market transition trade off as they interact with environmental variability to affect farmers? livelihoods. Using a longitudinal design, ethnographic, and cutting-edge social network methods, the researchers aim to characterize (1) how social relationships and economic activities are affected by market transition over time; and (2) how reliance on relationships versus labor market participation are associated with health and well-being. The researchers investigate further the extent to which climate variables affect people's social relationships, economic activities, and daily lives, creating much-needed links between social and climate science. Finally, the research provides validity tests and other tools to meet the stated needs of Vulnerability Assessments required by policy makers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in economic development.

For example, many large, earthquake-producing faults around the world also exhibit persistent episodes of seismic tremor (shaking that is only perceptible with modern instruments) accompanying slow slip (at rates of millimeters per year rather than the meters per second rates typical of earthquakes). This process, known as ?episodic tremor and slow slip?, has been proposed to be a potential precursory phenomenon that may forecast larger earthquake ruptures. Leveraging this forecasting potential, however, requires determining the physical mechanisms underlying episodic tremor and slow slip, which is hindered by the lack of a definitive geologic record. This research will test the validity of a recently proposed geologic record of episodic tremor and slow slip: quartz veins that form incrementally following micro-slip events in earthquake-producing faults. This work will quantify the time scales of vein formation via hydrothermal experiments and assess their compatibility with those of the recurrence of episodic tremor and slow slip observed in active faults.<br/><br/>Although much of the formation of incrementally developed quartz slickenfibers is consistent with seismological observations of episodic tremor and slow slip (depth, presence of fluids, stress drops, etc), a critical question remains unanswered: are the time scales of slickenfiber formation compatible with seismologically observed repeat times? For this to be true, quartz cements delineating microslip increments in slickenfibers must precipitate over time scales from 3 months to ~2 years depending on tectonic setting. Given typical fracture opening increments observed in slickenfibers, this conceptual model implies quartz precipitation rates of more than 10 ?m / year. These rates are several orders of magnitude faster than those predicted by current kinetic-rate models. Recent work has argued that coseismic decreases in pore-fluid pressure may stimulate transient increases in quartz growth rates, allowing slickenfiber formation over time scales consistent with the recurrence of episodic tremor and slow slip. To test this hypothesis, this research will utilize a novel approach that allows accurate detection of precipitation rates as small as ~3 ?m / year in hydrothermal experiments simulating large coseismic decreases in fluid pressure. Critically, these experiments will be conducted at temperature and pressure conditions consistent with the crustal depths where episodic tremor and slow slip occurs. Thus, the proposed work will be able to unequivocally determine if the time scales of slickenfiber formation are compatible with those of episodic tremor and slow slip, regardless of how much quartz is grown over the course of the experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The absorption of light by molecules can lead to cleavage of chemical bonds but it is often difficult to understand why or how specific bonds break. Dr. Winter and his students seek to understand the structure-reactivity principles for one general type of bond cleavage, specifically photochemical heterolysis of bonds between carbon and a leaving group.   Heterolysis represents one of the possible ways in which a chemical bond can break, with both of the two electrons in the bond being given to one of the departing groups.  Photoheterolysis reactions are important in biology, materials science and environmental chemistry. The long-term goal in this project is to create a predictive theoretical framework, which can relate chemical structure to excited state reactivity, thereby providing new guiding mechanistic principles that direct photochemical reactions.  Among broader impacts activities, Professor Winter will also be involved with a Freshman Research Initiative that involves first year college students in an early multidisciplinary research experience. He will also continue to recruit undergraduates and students from underrepresented groups into his lab. <br/><br/>To study these photoheterolysis reactions, the PI will employ a combined  theoretical/experimental approach. High-level computational methods will be used to map excited state transition states and surface crossing topologies in model systems.

In particular, ultrafast femtosecond-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy will be used to determine the rates and mechanisms of photoheterolysis reactions on selected substrates, while high-level excited state calculations will be used to provide a mechanistic rationale.

Understanding NT dynamics is essential to understanding brain function but the means by which specific neurotransmitters achieve their behavioral effects is still largely unknown and requires accurate, real-time quantification in brain structures. To meet this challenge, in this project funded by the CBET, Biosensing program of the CMMI division, a collaborative team of biosensing experts, computer engineers and neurophysiologists at Clarkson University and the White River Junction VA Medical center are developing novel electrochemical enzyme biosensors that can measure multiple NTs with increased accuracy with little or no false detection. The biosensors will be integrated with statistical and machine learning methods and will be used to study the neurochemical environment in a rat model of Parkinson?s Disease. The research will enhance education and training of life sciences and engineering students at Clarkson University who will work synergistically with the team of investigators to develop next generation biosensing technologies for monitoring neurotransmission in the brain. <br/><br/>The project will develop biosensing devices that incorporate NT-specific materials and electrode surfaces for in vivo monitoring of neuronal activity. The research team will engineer an oxygen-rich nanoarchitecture containing an enzyme-like biomimetic catalyst and NT-specific enzymes, stabilized within a conductive network and develop automatic fabrication procedures to ensure scalable and reproducible manufacturing of these biosensors. These materials will be designed to ensure long-term bioactivity and operability for recognition of specific NTs and are expected to improve our ability to study the complex neural mechanisms involved in signaling in the brain. Research will involve the following tasks: 1) develop selective NT-specific nanostructures with high durability and sensitivity for enzyme-based microbiosensors that can measure dopamine, glutamate and acetylcholine, 2) computational work to produce predictive fingerprint models of NT dynamics using electrochemical data, and 3) in vivo work to determine the temporal profile of changes in NT concentrations during high frequency stimulation in normal and ?hemi-parkinsonian? animals. Educational activities will involve 1) student participation in research and dissemination through presentations and publications, 2) hands on education though implementation of a biosensing module in the new interdisciplinary Biomedical Engineering and Biomedical Science and Technology degree programs at Clarkson, 3) sites and virtual visits and demonstrations of neuromonitoring and neurostimulation experiments in live animals at Dartmouth College. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefit from the discovery of new NT-specific materials and the development of novel biosensing tolls that could be used broadly by the biomedical community for studying neurochemical changes in the brain, as well as the education and training of students who will be uniquely trained to tackle grand challenges in neuroscience and device engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, it seeks to better understand how viruses shape the biology and evolution of their hosts beyond the typical view that viruses are entities that make their hosts acutely sick.  New evidence has revealed that viruses are just as ubiquitous in all living organisms as are the bacteria that form the microbiome. In addition to playing important roles in the lives of their hosts, some of these viruses might be co-opted to combat diseases transmitted by mosquitoes and other vectors.  Second, this project seeks to equip budding scientists with the computational skills they will need to thrive in a new era of big data in Biology. This will increase the competitiveness of these individuals by arming them with increasingly essential skills for working in the bioeconomy. This education will take the form of training of individual students, an existing graduate course, a new undergraduate course that takes evidence-based measures to foster participation and success of female students, and three annual workshops. Third, through collaboration with experts in citizen science and science outreach, this project will engage the public in a crowdsourced sample collection effort. The citizen scientists will not only contribute valuable samples and data that would be otherwise unobtainable but will also make their own inquiries about important scientific concepts relating to viruses and the nature of science. The educational resources we will develop will be suitable for use in classrooms or homes.<br/><br/>Bacterial endosymbionts can shape the evolution and ecology of their hosts in profound ways. One goal of NSF is to support basic research, and this proposal meets this goal by examining viral endosymbionts. Emerging evidence from metagenomics is revealing that there exists a previously unappreciated group of viruses that have similar properties, are just as common, and might also play a significant role in the lives of their hosts. The proposed research focuses on one of these viruses, a remarkably successful ?viral endosymbiont? of Drosophila melanogaster called galbut virus. Galbut virus is ubiquitous in wild populations of these fruit flies, and exemplifies two paradoxes associated with vertically transmitted symbionts. First, despite efficient biparental vertical transmission, which modeling indicates should drive infection to fixation, only 60% of individual flies are infected.  Second, despite a seeming reliance on vertical transmission, there is substantial evidence that galbut virus readily jumps into new host species. Proposed experiments combine genetics, genomics, infection experiments, and crowdsourced field sampling to explore the dynamics of this fascinating virus within and between host populations. This will contribute to a more accurate understanding of the evolutionary and ecological impact of viruses beyond their role as acute pathogens. Broader impacts include the training of graduate and undergraduate students, 3 annual workshops (2 existing and one new), and a new undergraduate course in computational microbiology that will be implemented in an evidence-based manner to encourage participation and success of female students. The proposed citizen-science based sample collection and outreach program will empower volunteers to make their own inquiries about the nature and practice of science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its goal is to introduce undergraduate students to key elements of research on land and water resources essential to improving management practices, with a focus on Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) and diverse interdisciplinary research teams. Each year, students divided into three teams to conduct research that integrates Earth-surface dynamics, geology, hydrology and other disciplines. Research teams are hosted by two Native American communities (Confederated Salish Kootenai Tribes and Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa) and the University of Minnesota to work on projects developed in collaboration with the tribes' resource management divisions. This REU Site incorporates an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach that emphasizes quantitative and predictive methods, CBPR, indigenous research methods, and traditional ecological knowledge. The REU Site encourages participation by underrepresented students and students who are unsure about how they fit into the world of science to pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/>The REU Site is developing a new paradigm for undergraduate research that will increase participation of all students, particularly URMs in the geosciences via a transformative process that places the communities where research is being conducted and the participants themselves at the core of the program design. The REU is designed to be transformative not only to student participants, but to the institutions themselves, by increasing interaction between tribal communities, tribal colleges, and mainstream research institutions. The program design starts from the position that diversity in the geosciences can only happen when the system itself is fundamentally changed, adopting a partnership rather than a domination model. Every aspect of the REU is considered from the perspective of increasing institutional capacity for inclusive excellence. The PIs are building knowledge on increasing participation in REUs by the non-traditional student and students from groups underrepresented in STEM. The PIs are building knowledge on increasing participation in REUs by non-traditional students and students from groups underrepresented in STEM. The researchers have developed a proven, structured, scaffolded method of teaching science research and writing, which takes students who may have never written a technical research paper and provides them with the skills and support needed to routinely deliver high quality intellectual outputs and increase their intellectual self-confidence in the process. The mentoring plan for the REU Site is focused on helping mentors to: a) prepare to mentor highly diverse teams of students; b) support mentors to deal with the expectations, issues and challenges that arise when you are mentoring teams that have a large number of nontraditional students; and c) help mentors get acculturated to conducting research on tribal lands and with Native people. The students, faculty, graduate and post-doctoral mentors, tribal professionals and other community members are intimately engaged in CBPR, developing projects that inherently support tribal resource management goals. Results are disseminated to tribal authorities and community members as well as the broader scientific community. Outcomes of this REU research paradigm will concurrently establish a legacy of broader scientific capacity within reservation communities and provide pathways to scientific discoveries with a shared foundation of trust and respect.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the EAR Education and Human Resources program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and GEO-ICER.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gudmundsdottir of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cincinnati is analyzing how crystals respond to external stimuli such as light and mechanical force. These studies focus on producing motility or movement in crystalline materials using momentum generated by releasing a gas.  The mechanism is analogous to the operation of a gasoline engine. The response of crystals to external stimuli can be quite dramatic, as such crystals that can propel themselves over distances much larger than their own size, twist, coil, crawl, bend, fracture, or even shatter. Because dynamic crystals respond rapidly to external stimuli such as light, heat, and mechanical force, they have potential for use in various smart materials applications, such as sensors and actuators in industrial processes and devices. The interdisciplinary nature of this research project provides broad educational training for students. Through this research, students will learn to solve demanding technical problems facing society. Emphasis will be placed on building an inclusive and diverse research team to work in the Gudmundsdottir laboratory, including high school and college undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in science. Students will also be presented with educational activities geared towards their professional training.<br/> <br/>The Gudmundsdottir research team will study the photodynamic and mechanical behavior of crystalline divinyl azide and ester azide derivatives.  Upon light exposure, these substances  dissociate to form molecular N2 gas and photoproducts. The physical properties of these crystals will be determined by acquiring their single crystal X-ray structures, indexing the crystals, and measuring their hardness. In addition, the solid-state photoreactivity of these compounds will be determined by performing laser flash photolysis of nanocrystals to characterize the transients formed within the crystals.  Further studies will determine the solid-state kinetics of these transients and identify their photo-products. Collectively, these data will be analyzed with an eye toward elucidating the detailed solid-state reaction mechanisms and toward explaining how the crystal lattice controls both the molecular reactivity and the macromolecular photodynamic behavior of divinyl azide and ester azide derivatives.

Accurate soil information is a fundamental driver of better, more efficient crop/soil management.  The new technology would significantly increase farm profitability, lower food costs, and improve environmental protection and sustainability. Making higher quality soil fertility mapping readily available and usable is the goal of this project.  This technology is expected to result in increased crop yield while allowing for decreased input costs, leading to higher profits in an industry that chronically suffers from low profit margins. The expected benefits include more environmentally responsible farm management and better manure-management planning, nutrient-management planning, precision farming, land use planning, planting decisions, evaluating stressors on plants, field conditioning, crop rotation, and prediction/interpretation of yields. These will result in increased farm profitability, more efficient application of nitrogen fertilizers, and increased soil health and fertility for plants.  <br/><br/>This project advances an innovative technology has three key components to produce maps of essential soil nutrients in training fields and beyond ? maps that currently require extensive sampling while producing inadequate data. The first is a digital hill-slope position to select optimal sampling locations to represent the soil variability across the landscape, eliminating the need to take unnecessary soil samples. The second element leverages advanced machine-learning algorithms insensitive to the quantity of sample size. The third element is its ability to select suitable remotely sensed information (terrain derivatives and satellite imagery). The technology will select appropriate analysis scales of terrain derivatives to capture all potential soil variability. It will then select and use proper bands of satellite imagery, based on spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, to decrease the risks of overfitting and computation time.

Previous work has shown that only a fraction of cyber abuse victims adopt self-protective behaviors. This may occur because some victims lack the background knowledge required to identify cyber abuse and to assert appropriate protective behaviors. While education can be effective in this regard, classroom delivery may fail to reproduce the diverse and dynamic context of cyber abuse, making it difficult for students to effectively translate knowledge into practice. This project seeks to increase the adoption of self-protective behaviors by integrating educational content into social networking interactions. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques will be used to optimize the placement and timing of educational content. The project has the potential to improve the security and privacy of vulnerable social network users.<br/><br/>The project team will leverage their expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and education to investigate, develop and evaluate a new educational framework that provides just-in-time awareness training to identify and respond appropriately to cyber abuse when using social networks. First, the team will develop AI-based solutions to detect and classify cyber abuse based on abuse traces in the accounts of the users involved. The team will also leverage data and feedback collected from study participants to build a ground-truth dataset of instances and timelines of cyber abuse. Second, the team will design and implement targeted learning content and user interface nudges to deliver the knowledge required to make safer decisions in social network interactions. Third, the team will develop AI-based techniques to determine the ideal placement of learning content that improves user adoption of self-protective behaviors. Finally, the unique features of Facebook will be exploited to design evaluation experiments and educational outcomes-based techniques that capture user behaviors in the context of their regular Facebook interactions.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

However, transforming this promise to practical impact requires easy-to-deploy tools that appropriately address existing roadblocks. This project develops new tools for accurate and scalable probabilistic machine learning with spatiotemporal data. Furthermore, the approach is motivated by applications to mapping dynamic brain connectivity from human brain imaging data. The importance of dynamic brain connectivity lies in its description of neural information processing mechanisms, along with potentially transformative applications to understanding and treating neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This project will develop new techniques for estimating brain connectivity and apply these methods to the neuroscientific tasks of explaining inter-individual differences in cognition and behavior.  This project will include curriculum development on probabilistic models for spatiotemporal data. This project also plans to involve participation by graduate students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>This project creates a transformative new direction for modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal data by addressing the fundamental challenges of modeling, scalability, and mitigating data biases. The first challenge is modeling, which refers to the inflexible assumptions of existing spatiotemporal models -- leading to under-fitting. To this end, this project develops modular probabilistic models that capture structured variability.  Another pressing challenge is the computational scalability of inference and learning for such probabilistic models. This project tackles scalability by developing principled sample-selection methods for scalable approximate inference with performance guarantees.  A third challenge is data bias, which occurs because data from a single source is often not statistically representative. Thus, models fit using single-source data have inconsistent and non-reproducible results. This project addresses data bias by combining data across multiple sources using novel federated learning for shared estimation without requiring direct data sharing. In addition to developing the algorithmic and theoretical frameworks for these directions, this project will also build and release open software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sustaining human coastal communities has become an urgent societal priority. The Coastal Sustainability workshop will leverage nature-based solutions and develop a framework that identifies the interactions and ""friction points"" to determine what suite of nature-based solutions are best suited for a given coastal community and what the barriers are to their implementation. The workshop organizers intend to support an inclusive process that considers the existing inequities in the hidden coast ? non-oceanfront regions where rural, minority, and/or impoverished communities reside. The goal is to shape the co-development of convergent research that is stakeholder-driven, inclusive, and focused on implementation of sustainability solutions that promote clean, safe, smart, and equitable coastal communities. <br/><br/>The framework that the workshop seeks to create will be shaped by substantial stakeholder engagement during collaborative discussion and analysis of factors (including Ecological and Geophysical, Cognitive and Social, Technological, and Economic). The goal is to identify and create opportunities within a landscape of uncertainty: in management practice, in scientific and societal understanding, and in cognition of threats and opportunities. The workshop will collaboratively identify the basis of uncertainties around development and implementation of nature-based coastal sustainability solutions as well as mechanisms for overcoming them. This process will facilitate the identification, assessment, and optimization of viable and implementable sustainability solutions across a variety of coastal communities. The synthesis report that will result from the workshop will provide a blueprint that outlines the specific inflection points where investment in convergent research will be most effective in accelerating sustainable outcomes for communities.<br/><br/>Nature-based solutions are most likely to be effective when communities co-create them in collaboration with expert practitioners, ensuring that the solutions are tailored to meet specific community needs.

Consequently, a critical and unmet need exists for building a workforce that is capable of effectively addressing these imminent threats. The recent intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones have resulted in multiple flood events in Houston, Lake Charles, New Orleans, and even inland regions like North Carolina (Hurricane Florence in 2018 and remnants of Eta in 2020). Miami has been called the most vulnerable coastal city worldwide, with high-tide flooding under blue skies becoming common. The city of Boston has implemented plans to protect its harbor from rising sea level, but proven methodologies are still lacking. These are just a few examples of threats to coastal and inland populations due to a lack of advanced water management skills.  This project will capitalize on unique expertise, facilities, and coastal geology in the Netherlands to provide a 2-week training opportunity at key Dutch sites each year for 14 advanced U.S. graduate students on the topic of water management. While in the Netherlands for training, they will be exposed to expertise, equipment, and coastal systems that they would not be able to access within the U.S. By providing these experiences, the participants will gain crucial expertise, insight, and connections to world-leading experts to promote their success in water management careers.  The program will improve U.S. flood protection capabilities while at the same time enhancing the success of early career professionals from diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>Critical expertise in water management will be built through the participation of U.S. graduate students in this training program to be held in the Netherlands, one of the leading countries in water management technology.

For years, farmers growing organic, non-genetically modified (non-GM) and specialty crops have incurred crop damage and financial losses due to drift of volatile herbicides, such as dicamba. The EPA estimates that up to 70 million pounds of pesticides, including herbicides, are lost to the environment due to drift each year. In 2017 alone, 3.6 million acres of soybeans were destroyed due to dicamba drifting away from its site of application. This project addresses the problem with a novel technology that reduces herbicide volatility and drift. This technology will help farmers growing GM-crops who face litigation because they spray drifting dicamba, and those who grow non-GM-crops and do not want drifted dicamba to impact their produce. Agrochemical companies currently facing EPA restrictions, product bans, and billions of dollars in lawsuits, can use this technology to improve the application efficiency of their products. This technology offers significant environmental benefits. Furthermore, beyond its agricultural use, the bio-based formulation is a platform technology that may be used to develop other applications from food to pharmaceuticals to cosmetics.<br/> <br/>The innovation proposed in this STTR Phase I project is a bio-based emulsion adjuvant, derived from renewable resources, with the combined functionality of a drift control agent, buffering agent, and surfactant, to reduce the volatility and off-target movement of herbicides, and improve their efficacy. The proposed adjuvant offers encapsulating, environmental and financial benefits relative to the state of practice.  The project has the following objectives to evaluate and demonstrate the technical feasibility of the innovation: 1) develop and optimize the composition of the formulation, 2) characterize properties important for its use in herbicide spray mixtures, such as surface tension, thermal stability, fluid flow, water conditioning and defoaming behavior,  3) conduct humidome tests and field trials to validate the effectiveness of the formulation with respect to fine spray droplets suspended in the air  and herbicide activity against pigweed (Palmer amaranth), using dicamba as the model herbicide, and 4) determine the biodegradability profile of the formulation in soil and water environments and its aquatic toxicity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peptides play vital roles in modulating biological function. Their ability to bind to their targets with high affinity and selectivity is dependent on both their chemical composition and conformation. As such, tools to rapidly modify and control both are required to streamline drug discovery efforts. In this project, novel methods are developed to achieve these goals. Selective chemical transformations are developed for late-stage peptide functionalization, and methods are developed for their subsequent cyclization/ligation under mild aqueous conditions. Strategic incorporation of functional groups is explored to control the conformation and stability of the resulting peptide or protein mimics. Broader impacts of the project will include continued mentoring and training of ACS Project SEED high school students and NSF REU students during the summer, as well as educational presentations in high schools across North Carolina. Virtual lab tours and other videos will also be produced in collaboration with the Science House at NCSU. <br/><br/>Under this award, Dr. Caroline Proulx will develop new methods to access conformationally-constrained, highly functionalized ketoxime and kethydrazone peptides starting from tunable N-aryl peptide precursors. These substrates are expected to undergo triggered ligations under catalyst-free aqueous conditions that also exhibit high functional group tolerance. This project aims to introduce a wide array of side chain chemistry at the site of ligation using late-stage peptide functionalization reactions. The alpha-carbon substituent will be used to better mimic natural amino acid side chains, fine-tune stability of the linkage, and control E/Z ratios in the resulting kethydrazone or ketoxime-linked peptides. In addition, the N-aryl ring will be tuned to enable one-pot, sequential ligation for the synthesis of protein-length material. In the longer term, this work seeks to lay the groundwork for the establishment of structure-folding-function rules for this new class of unnatural peptide- and protein-mimicking oligomers for chemical biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This EAGER award sees to gain a deeper scientific understanding of the genomes and strain mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses by developing and applying innovative comparative genomic and population genetic methods leveraging the expertise of the investigators in these areas. These analyses will elucidate the relative contributions of evolutionary forces that shape the SARS-CoV-2 genome and other virus genomes across deep and recent evolutionary time scales and will pinpoint functionally important positions in their genomes. They will inform efforts of the broader scientific community to model the dynamics of infection, strategies for mitigation, and to develop therapeutics. This research will be integrated into educational programs that leverage the BIG summer undergraduate research program and the Computational Genomics Summer Institute at UCLA.<br/><br/>The specific aims are to develop and apply comparative genomic analyses for SARS-CoV-2 using multiple genome alignments of various coronavirus genomes. The work will leverage the recently developed ConsHMM method to annotate the SARS-CoV-2 genome at single nucleotide resolution into different conservation states. ConsHMM defines conservation states based on the combinatorial and spatial patterns of which species align to and match a reference genome using a multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM). These conservation states will be related to other annotations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome including (inter)genic and key protein regions. Population genetic approaches will be applied to publicly available sequences of the SARS-Cov-2 genome to infer fundamental properties of mutations. To estimate these parameters, novel structured coalescent-based models will be developed that account for demographic processes across multiple time points and locations. While the initial investigation will focus on the large collections of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that are becoming available, the methods developed will be applicable to the study of viral genomes (such as other coronaviruses, influenza, ebola, and HIV) and their strain mutations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Molecules may exist in two possible mirror-image forms, which are commonly described as right-handed or left-handed structures. New molecules are isolated from plants and animals, and are created in the lab by chemists. The structure of molecules determine their physical properties such as their physical form, liquid or solid, and how they interact with living systems. Odor and taste come from the shape and structure of a molecule.  More significantly, molecular drugs are effective because their shapes interact with proteins to alleviate diseases. The Rychnovsky group is using osmium complexes to simplify the determination of structure of new molecules, as well as computer modeling. In difficult cases, the final step to proving a structure consists of constructing the molecule in a lab from simpler components?chemical synthesis. Undergraduate and graduate students will carry out the research for this project. UC Irvine is a Hispanic Serving Institution, providing ample opportunities to recruit talented Hispanic (and other minority) students to participate in this project. Professor Rychnovsky works with the faculty at Santiago Community College to help their students develop their research skills and expertise. This project is expected to have a strong impact on student training, helping to build the future STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce for both careers in industry and in academia.<br/><br/>The award supports the development of osmate derivatives to improve the crystallinity of complex molecules. Osmates are often highly crystalline, and the density of the osmium metal facilitates the determination of structure and handedness by X-ray crystallography (anomalous dispersion).  Chemical synthesis tools are also being developed, including a new intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction that builds new six-membered rings with easily predicted geometries. Computational modeling of spectroscopic properties is used to test plausible structure to determine if they correctly match the newly isolated molecular structures. Comparing the computer-predicted properties with the measured properties is a powerful technique to determine molecular structure. A final test is to build the best proposed structure from simpler fragments to prove that it matches the newly isolated molecule. The research is well suited for the training of undergraduate and graduate scientists, and students with diverse backgrounds are recruited to participate in this project. Santiago Community College has many students who transfer to the UC system, but they rarely have the opportunity to participate in research projects.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-based tools can help human analysts sort through large volumes of data to determine if an attack on these systems has happened.  Yet, AI components are also vulnerable to attacks, and require development of techniques to make them more robust. This collaborative project between the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) and the University of Illinois addresses the research and educational aspects of combining AI and cybersecurity. Educational and training materials will be developed for use by college and university instructors and students and by cybersecurity and AI professionals. These materials will address how AI can improve security systems and how cybersecurity analytics can protect AI systems. In addition, the project will recruit students from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in computing. <br/><br/>This project has three interrelated topics. The first focuses on education and extends the project team?s existing cybersecurity concept inventory to include relevant AI-related concepts. Student knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity and AI relatedness will be assessed before and after taking AI or cybersecurity courses.  Educational materials and projects  will also be created to demonstrate  how AI can be applied to cybersecurity problems and how cybersecurity tools can protect AI systems from attack. The second topic explores how the latest AI tools can support cybersecurity tasks. The creation and maintenance of semantic knowledge graphs of cyberthreat information will be studied and used to support reinforcement learning systems that are better at detecting the presence of malware in a host. The third topic focuses on finding new ways that cybersecurity tools can protect AI systems from becoming compromised by attacks such as data poisoning. Cyberthreat knowledge graphs and neural networks will be used to detect and eliminate likely disinformation from data used to train AI-based cybersecurity systems. This aspect of the project has applications beyond cybersecurity, such as countering disinformation. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These problems in turn rely on loss functions, which are mathematical tools to measure prediction (in)accuracy. Well-designed loss functions can guide both computers and humans in making accurate predictions. In machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, computers make predictions by choosing the predictive model that best fits historical data, as judged by a loss function. Yet a general framework to design and analyze loss functions is lacking for many common machine learning tasks. In economics, an efficient information economy is crucial to facilitate the trade of data, predictions, and other information. Unfortunately, current economic mechanisms fall short for settings involving competition and collaboration, which are vitally important to a healthy economy. This project will to address these shortcomings, by (a) developing a general framework to design and analyze loss functions in machine learning, and (b) designing collaborative and competitive mechanisms to facilitate markets for predictions, data, and beyond.  These results will impact a number of key economic sectors as our society continues to progress toward an information economy.<br/><br/>In supervised machine learning, algorithms employ surrogate loss functions, which are easier to optimize than the target loss but still solve the same problem. Despite their prevalence and importance, the literature lacks a general framework to systematically design and analyze surrogate losses. Such a framework is especially lacking in structured prediction settings, as in computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics, where one tries to predict an object like a tree or sequence. Using ideas from economics, the project will develop a new framework to study and design convex surrogate losses, with the potential for sharper and more general results. Using techniques from discrete convex geometry, this framework readily applies to polyhedral (piecewise linear convex) losses, a popular class in structured prediction. In algorithmic economics, information elicitation mechanisms, which exchange information for money, are a promising foundation for an information economy. The project will study a variety of new mechanisms, and develop new analyses of existing mechanisms, to increase efficiency and incentive-compatibility. Among these settings are machine learning competitions, forecasting competitions, and a new mechanism to fund general collaborative projects. These settings address several central questions about multi-agent elicitation mechanisms, some of which have been open for over a decade.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The experiments will be based on a new family of urban freight models, in lieu of expensive field measurements. In addition to creating the family of urban freight models, we plan to use them to investigate five primary hypotheses: (1) urban freight quality of service may be enhanced through traffic network and route reconfiguration. (2) urban neighborhoods with persistent, chronically inferior urban freight service sometimes emerge spontaneously, but their impact may be substantially ameliorated through incentivizing and subsidizing freight service providers. (3) The present demand for goods provisioned by large, publicly traded electronic retailers might not be sustainable because of their current use of internal subsidies and hidden costs to fund extremely low shipping fees, creating an unfunded liability through which investors sacrifice profits for market share. (4) When subsidies are scaled down and hidden shipping costs are made explicit, deleterious impacts on carriers, e-retailers and households may arise. (5) Food underserved areas (FUAs) arise from the combination of relatively low demand for and relatively high supply chain costs of healthy food items. The presence of food desserts is a serious social injustice that brings daily harm to those members of society who cannot find alternative sources of affordable, quality food.<br/><br/>The intended family of urban freight models will be explicitly dynamic and based on game theory. The models will depict the role urban freight systems in electronic commerce at the household level, including explicit recognition of food deliveries. A careful experimental design will be followed in assessing the aforementioned hypotheses. Accordingly, the intended family of models, as well as the experiments to assess hypotheses, will address the following considerations: (1) urban freight carriers compete with one another, not only for market share but also for urban routes and parking that are also valued by commuters and hired ride services; (2) there is an undeniable dynamic aspect to the flows of vehicles and consumption goods over metropolitan road networks; moreover, those flows involve multiple time scales that make the comparative statics paradigm nearly meaningless; (3) in an effort to be competitive, electronic retailers (e-retailers) are drawn into pricing games that purposely blur the distinction between delivery fees and the prices of purchased goods, with the consequence that it is necessary to simultaneously model both freight service and urban goods provisioning; (4) indirect evidence exists that pricing strategies employed in e-commerce do not fully cover delivery costs; (8) some electronic retailers offer discounted and promotional shipping rates, creating unfunded liabilities that bring into doubt both the medium- and long-term sustainability of their core transactions; and (9) there is a gap between the demand for healthy foods and the minimum order size that makes it worthwhile for food purveyors to deliver to certain neighborhoods, thereby creating food underserved areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fish, shellfish, dolphins, and other animals depend on the seagrasses, coral, algae, and other organisms in these balanced ecosystems to survive. When seagrasses are unhealthy, the rest of the system can suffer, and these benefits can be lost. Nutrient loading to these environments can increase due to waste discharge and other sources, causing an imbalance in the fragile ecosystem. Sometimes the extra nutrients can cause microscopic phytoplankton to grow rapidly or ?bloom? and smother seagrasses and corals. Some types of algal blooms can produce toxins that harmful to wildlife and people that are known as harmful algal blooms or ?HABs?. In late March to early April 2021, concerns were raised about the stability of a reservoir containing wastewater from a defunct fertilizer plant in Piney Point, Florida. These concerns prompted the release of 215 million gallons of waste into Tampa Bay to prevent the reservoir from collapsing. The wastewater contains large concentrations of nutrients that may upset the balance in the coastal receiving waters, causing algal blooms and possibly HABs. Damage to this ecosystem is especially concerning because Tampa Bay has been a seagrass restoration success story since the 1990s. To address these concerns, research will use advanced scientific tools to specifically track the transport of nutrients from the wastewater to determine their impact on local seagrasses. Successful completion of this research will benefit society by helping water management professionals determine how to mitigate the impacts of excess nutrient loading and better protect these valuable ecosystems. Additional benefits will result from increased scientific literacy through outreach with local estuary monitoring groups to inform residents about the specific ways that nutrient-rich wastes impact their coastal ecosystems.<br/><br/>The release of nutrients along the Nation?s coastlines represents a chronic threat to nearshore ecosystems. Impacts from increased nutrient loading range from eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and the production of hypoxic zones. Discharges from a reservoir containing wastewater from a defunct fertilizer plant at Piney Point, Florida has garnered national attention as it threatens estuaries in the Tampa Bay region. The release of 215 million gallons of nitrogen and phosphorus-rich effluent threatens an ecosystem that has been considered a seagrass restoration success story. A major concern is that these discharges may trigger macroalgae and/or phytoplankton blooms, thereby threatening the ecologically and economically valuable seagrass communities in the region. The goal of this research is to trace the nutrient inputs from the Piney Point breach to better understand these threats. This objective will be achieved using a novel multi-stable isotope approach to: (1) Characterize the signature of Piney Point effluent; (2) Track the fate of the effluent as it is transported to the nearshore environment; and (3) Evaluate changes in primary producers (phytoplankton communities, macroalgae, and seagrasses) within the region. The research hypothesis is that discharge from Piney Point will result in a rapid response from phytoplankton and macroalgae, resulting in conditions that may restrict light availability and negatively impact local seagrass communities. The ephemeral nature of this event necessitates quick deployment to obtain samples at the outflow and throughout Tampa Bay. Successful completion of this research addresses the wider problem of waste discharge from aging and failing infrastructure, a persistent issue throughout the Nation?s coastlines. The results of this research will further benefit society by advancing our understanding of these impacts on fragile coastal ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These storms often induce overwash, a process where water and sediments flow over coastal barriers, erode the beach, and deposit sediments atop and behind the barrier. Geoscientists often use deposits of overwash in coastal ponds to infer when hurricanes occurred in the past, prior to written and satellite records of hurricanes. These sedimentary records of past hurricane activity are useful for constraining the probability of a hurricane making landfall on a stretch of coastline, or for understanding changes in hurricane frequency in response to past changes in climate, and are commonly integrated into hazard assessments. However, these sedimentary records are limited to reconstructing the frequency of past storms, while inferences into the magnitude or track of these events remain preliminary. In this project, the investigators will harness recent advances in computer simulations of coastal sediment transport to develop a new approach for reconstructing storm strength and track from overwash deposits. <br/><br/>This project will integrate field-based observations of overwash from sediment cores with state-of-the-art simulations of observed and simulated hurricanes to: (i) evaluate the influences of storm properties on overwash deposition in back-barrier settings, (ii) diagnose the sensitivity of depositional patterns to geomorphic change, and (iii) relate storm strength and track to the properties of overwash deposits. This work will deliver quantitative reconstructions of hurricane magnitude for southern New England ? a heavily-populated region that is vulnerable to tropical cyclones ? extending the historical record of hurricane activity in this region back centuries to provide insight into strengths and tracks of prehistoric hurricanes that made landfall in this region. The investigators anticipate that the integrative and scalable approach developed here will be applicable to other coastlines in the United States and abroad that are vulnerable to tropical and extratropical cyclones, and will facilitate the critical challenge of predicting and mitigating against coastal erosion and flooding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The horizontal lateral force resisting system, consisting of the diaphragm, chords, and collectors, often requires retrofit during renovations, when penetrations are cut in the slab, or in older buildings when deficiencies in the in-plane load path, strength, or ductility are discovered. Externally bonded fiber reinforced polymers are increasingly being used to improve diaphragm performance because they are easier to install and do not increase the building weight as compared with conventional concrete and steel strengthening. However, because of their relatively large size and other factors, little research has been conducted to understand how externally bonded composites can be best used to retrofit deficient horizontal lateral force resisting systems. The new retrofit approaches to be developed in this research are important for their potential to increase infrastructure resilience to natural hazards such as earthquakes, as well as improving infrastructure sustainability through adaptive reuse rather than demolition and reconstruction. This project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students and will curate a social media microblog to excite and inspire individuals underrepresented in science and engineering. This award will contribute to the National Science Foundation (NSF) role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).

Since public health statistics are used by private enterprise as well as the public sector and the general public, the addition of a trust layer to public health data more widely is important as fidelity in statistics is critical to effective individual and organizational action.<br/><br/>This project?s goal is to develop tools and practices to make authoritative, reliable data available, enabled by cryptographic techniques and accessible to a broader set of individuals and organizations. The scope of the project looks to develop aggregation, access, and reporting systems which can support new decentralized economics, such as smart contract marketplaces, while remaining interoperable and accessible to users of legacy technology. The solution requires creation of a single, trustworthy platform that combines research, development and commercial application of emerging blockchain approaches with a suite of supporting technologies and systems including: distributed data infrastructure, flexible delivery methods, intuitive interfaces, and analytics tools. This research hopes to allow for the creation of novel resources to support the trustworthiness and consequently, the fundamental usefulness of all public health data records. The expected outcomes include: improved data integrity using blockchain-backed systems, tools enabling accelerated innovation in data driven decision making, and a prototype marketplace for COVID-19 resources managed by blockchain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bioaerosols are airborne biological particles, such as pollen, fungal spores, and soil bacteria.  Winds and thunderstorm updrafts loft biological material from the surface where they may serve as nuclei for the development of cloud droplets and ice crystals.  The materials are then deposited back to the surface through precipitation, downdrafts, or gravitational settling.  Despite this big picture view, the magnitude of exchange and the impact on cloud processes are still poorly understood.  The research team will perform two field experiments using drones, balloons, instrumented towers, and surface instrumentation, combined with numerical modeling, to address a set of research questions related to bioaerosols.  The result will be an improvement in weather and climate models and generation of new insight into the transport of allergens for human health purposes.  A large set of students and early career researchers will be involved in the project, ensuring the training of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The research team will study the fluxes of bioaerosols between the Earth?s surface and atmosphere and feedbacks between bioaerosols and storm microphysics, dynamics, and precipitation.  The project objective is to quantitatively study the fluxes, concentrations, and identities of bioaerosols, specifically targeting intact pollen, sub-pollen particles, fungal spores and bacteria during convective storm updrafts, storm-generated cold pools, and quiescent conditions.  Two field campaigns are planned, with flux tower measurements at National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites, ground lab instrumentation, and drone-based sampling.  Measurements will include fluorescent and total particle distributions, fluxes, particle characterization, chemical analysis and DNA sequencing, among others.

Despite their widespread adoption in surgical practices, stapler malfunctioning or misuse can cause severe surgical and post-surgical complications which include bleeding, sepsis, and death. Misfiring and cutting errors are the main causes of staplers malfunctioning. This project proposes a semi-reusable surgical stapler which will provide real-time feedback to surgeons to guide the firing, thus reducing staplers malfunctioning and increasing surgeries success rates. The proposed solution combines a reusable control system, which will decrease the amount of toxic waste generated by the healthcare system (adding up to landfill and accounting for 25% of healthcare expenditures), and a disposable handle, which will allow to cut down the cost and time required for surgery preparation (40% savings/procedure).

The proposed system will assist surgeons by providing real-time information over the tissue to clamp and advising over the optimal cartridge to be used. This project will feature the design of the control system capable of sensing the tissue in the clamp and deciding optimal staple firing parameters. First, the components of the control system will be designed. Successively, the algorithm to control firing speed, energy consumption, and articulation will be developed on an empirical dataset. The project will establish the correlation between clamping forces and tissue parameters. The benefits yielded by the developed surgical stapler, will be benchmarked against commercial solutions both in vitro and ex vivo.

The high temperatures combined with extreme flow events, such as shock waves and turbulence, reduce the life of propulsion devices, such as gas turbine engines, high performance aircraft aero-engines, scramjets, rockets, lift-off and reentry vehicles, among others. The project will address complex thermal transport processes during the interactions of shock wave and turbulence with the goal of enabling safer and more reliable aero-propulsion engines. Fundamental understanding will be promoted, along with training, teaching, and learning by means of parallel education/outreach components, such as incorporation of findings in graduate education, and presentations in symposia and conferences. Women, minority students, and undergraduate students will also participate, as well as both teachers and students from local high schools. <br/><br/>This project seeks to improve the understanding of thermal turbulence transport by considering: (a) effects of shock wave mode, angle, orientation, and strength, and the sources and modes of shock wave unsteadiness which alter thermal transport and surface heat transfer, (b) the means whereby shock wave unsteadiness alters and propagates into subsonic boundary layer regions to affect near-wall thermal transport mechanisms and surface heat transfer, (c) effects of the strength and relative size of shock wave induced separation on thermal transport, (d) effects of shock wave compression heating, viscous friction heating, and conversion of kinetic energy to internal energy on thermal transport, and (e) resulting alterations to turbulence and scalar fluxes, second order turbulent quantities, and coherence and time lag distributions. Unsteady motions of different types of shock waves and unsteady, spatially-varying surface heat transfer and thermal transport will be considered through a coordinated experimental-computational study. A newly developed supersonic wind tunnel system will be employed, along with large eddy simulations, to provide detailed flow and thermal field characteristics. Crucial causal relationships will be clarified through understanding of: (i) associated thermal transport characteristics, (ii) spatially-dependent and frequency-dependent coherence and time lag between events at different flow conditions, (iii) highly-resolved experimental visualizations of unsteady flow features from which quantitative flow information will be determined, and (iv) spatio-temporal flow and thermal field-data from numerical predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These instabilities arise from the interaction of sound and heat release within the engine combustion chamber and represent a major challenge for safe and reliable operation of the engine. The frequent occurrence of thermoacoustic instabilities can limit the performance and the lifetime of gas turbine combustors, particularly when running under conditions designed to reduce emissions and fuel consumption. However, due to complex processes including chemical reactions, turbulent flow, heat release, and acoustic, a detailed simulation of thermoacoustic instabilities remains challenging and computationally expensive. The proposed project aims to develop a simpler mathematical model that can predict and capture the transition from stable to unstable behavior in combustors. Experiments will be carried out to assess the model's performance and to provide benchmark data for validating models developed by other researchers. The outcome of the study will enable engine designers to predict and mitigate thermoacoustic instabilities and improve reliability and performance. As a broader impact of the work, undergraduate and graduate students, particularly from underrepresented minority groups, will gain experience in using advanced experimental and modeling tools.<br/><br/>The program proposes to develop a synchronization-based framework to design low order models capable of capturing the dynamic transitional behaviors in turbulent combustors during thermoacoustic instabilities. The study, which synergistically includes modeling and experimental components, will facilitate the development of improved predictive tools to provide better control strategies in mitigating prevalent thermoacoustic instabilities. In modeling, the primary objective is to introduce a system of two mutually coupled oscillators, representing the flame and acoustics, to capture the bi-directional nature of the feedback in thermoacoustic instability. Such a model will capture three dynamical states, periodic, intermittent, and chaotic, observed in practical systems, hence overcome the shortcoming of unidirectionally coupled models, such as FTFs and FDFs. Furthermore, the program will develop experimental strategies, where the two-way coupled systems can be simulated by perturbing a flame with acoustic forcing whose frequency and amplitude are modulated based on the ensuing flame dynamics. The experiments will enable us to observe the differences in local and global flame dynamics when perturbed with coupled or de-coupled acoustic forcing and to gather data for model validation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We are able to recognize dynamic events, the roles that various entities play in these events and the causal and other relations that contribute to events. Furthermore, we use language to describe our dynamic experiences in ways that reflect our underlying event understanding. Despite the central role of events in human cognition and language, the study of events within the cognitive sciences has until recently remained fragmented. This research introduces novel theoretical and empirical tools to address key questions about the nature of events: How do we represent events in thought? How do novice (child) and experienced (adult) communicators use language to encode event representations? Do speakers of different languages think about events in the world differently? The proposed research presents a new and integrated approach to one of the most fundamental topics in the study of the mind, namely the connection between cognition and language. Because of its deeply interdisciplinary nature, this project offers unique training opportunities in the cognitive sciences at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate level. Moreover, the project exposes trainees to the excitement of international collaborations and fosters new academic partnerships. The project includes outreach and mentorship activities for interested members of the community who may not otherwise be exposed to academic research.<br/><br/>A unique feature of the proposed research is that it brings together two influential but separate lines of research on the structure of events, one studying perceptual and cognitive mechanisms of event representation, and the other focusing on the semantics of events in linguistics. Building on these two major approaches, this research proposes that the internal temporal structure of an event is an architectural feature of event cognition. A planned series of experiments aims to show that temporal event structure is computed rapidly and spontaneously during event perception, affects further cognitive processes such as event memory, and organizes event representations in both adults and children, and across people who speak different languages. This innovative combination of methods and theories allows us to explore previously hidden links between event cognition and event language and has the potential to reveal the precise format of event representations and their mapping to language that have so far remained elusive.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the benefits of breastfeeding throughout the first year of a baby?s life are widely accepted in the medical community, 60% of mothers do not succeed in sustained breastfeeding. The success or failure of breastfeeding is dependent upon a baby getting enough milk, and currently there is no objective method of determining the amount of milk a baby is receiving and how much residual milk remains in the breasts. The proposed device will collect objective data that will help mothers overcome challenges in breastfeeding and avoid further complications like clogged ducts and/or mastitis. Specifically, the device will help mothers track their milk output accurately, therefore reaching lactation goals, and allow mothers to ensure that babies receive the required nutrition to thrive during the early stages of life. The depersonalized data collected from the bra will enable medical professionals and researchers to gain insights about human milk production volumes and factors influencing milk production and infant health, thereby expanding horizons for further research in this field.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will create a proof-of-concept prototype bra that utilizes textile-based sensors to accurately measure the volume of milk expressed during a breastfeeding/breast pumping session. This project will lay important groundwork to create the first medical device using embedded fabric sensor technology to determine three data points: breast emptiness, milk volume output per session and changes in breast milk production over time. Research will focus on the design of the sensors and the form-factor of the bra that will facilitate capturing accurate data. There will be associated data capture and analysis demonstrating both measurable metric data trends to inform breastfeeding moms and aggregate cohort-level data trends for high level data analysis in an area with a paucity of actual data. When in use, the bra will be fitted to women while breastfeeding or pumping and be able to determine both the milk depletion and residual volume in the milk ducts and the volume of milk produced. After completing additional R&D, the product will perform three different functions: 1) determine the degree of breast emptiness; 2) measure the volume of milk expressed per session; 3) detect early risk of clogged ducts to avoid mastitis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum technologies are governed by the physics of sub-atomic particles and have relevance to computing, sensing, imaging, metrology, communications, and cryptography. Because of their wide-ranging applicability, quantum technologies have the potential to be transformative, with uses in intelligence, financial security, computing, medicine, and navigation. Society has entered the second quantum revolution, but it is still in its infancy, and the nascent quantum industry requires significant fundamental research to mature novel technologies. In partnership with industrial members, the CQT researchers will use their expertise in quantum science and engineering to develop and transfer foundational knowledge into industry-friendly quantum devices, systems, and algorithms with enhanced functionality and performance. Additionally, the CQT will help train the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers to support the development of a critically needed quantum workforce. Students will not only conduct Center research, but also help writing project reports, present at biannual meetings, and interact with industry and government members. Finally, the CQT will leverage established programs at each of the four universities to engage and support students traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>At Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, one of the four Center sites, the academic expertise in the fields of quantum materials, quantum sensing and quantum information will be meshed with the needs of industrial partners.

Perchlorate is highly toxic and is present in contaminated groundwater of at least 75 known sites nationwide due to past manufacture of propellants, explosives, and fertilizers. This project seeks to develop a promising new technology for removing the perchlorate from water. Scale-up work is needed in order to treat large volumes of contaminated underground water. The materials are sustainable and the technology limits will be determined with regard to treating large volumes of groundwater pumped from the extraction wells. The commercial impact could be significant, saving companies and state governments the expense of the single-use resins currently in use for removal of perchlorate from water. The determination of the limits of the materials will confirm the cost-effectiveness of the technology for cleaning bodies of water polluted by this toxic compound. The researchers involved in the project will gain practical knowledge of regulated water treatment in an end-user environment. The undergraduate students from two NSF summer research programs(NSF REU and NIH ACCESS) will continue to participate in the project.<br/><br/>The proposed project will continue to develop a perchlorate removal technology, which began with model solutions and progressed to actual contaminated underground water from an industrial site. With small volumes (50 to 500 mL) at a time, the prototype cationic materials the team has developed release environmentally-friendly species upon uptake of the perchlorate in record speed, amount and selectivity over other species in the water such as chloride. In addition, the team can reuse the material by driving the perchlorate back out with excess of the original species, giving a highly concentrated waste form for disposal (but more likely reuse as perchlorate source for industry). The team will set up a flow column where the water is pumped or cycled through/past the ion exchange material. Once optimized in the lab, larger volumes will be pilot tested directly at the industrial extraction wells. The treated water will be probed by a suite of instrumentation available in the lab.

Gaby Avila-Bront of the College of the Holy Cross is using a microscope capable of visualizing individual molecules to understand the fundamental driving forces that determine how a mixture of different molecules bound to a surface forms a two-dimensional pattern. Although surfaces modified with molecular patterns find many applications including serving as chemical and physical sensors, it is currently not possible to precisely control the composition of a molecular pattern composed of dissimilar molecules on a surface. Furthermore, prior to mixing, there is no knowledge of what two-dimensional patterns may form, or what new properties of the surface will be observed. Even though the behavior of mixtures has been thoroughly investigated in three-dimensions, the picture is not complete because current treatments do not properly consider chemical processes that occur on surfaces. This presents a challenge for understanding how molecules mix on surfaces, and predicting the pattern of a mixture of molecules on a surface. Successfully addressing these issues could provide scientists with unprecedented top-down control over surface modification with molecular patterning. All of the research in this lab is conducted and driven by undergraduate students. These students will conduct the experiments, analyze and interpret the data, and will be encouraged to present their findings at scientific conferences, while working closely with Dr. Avila-Bront to produce manuscripts for publication. In doing so, the students are developing and honing their problem-solving skills so that they can transfer these skills in the post-graduate fields of their choice.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this work is to understand the mechanism of two-dimensional mixing processes and construct the experimental phase diagram of two-component (binary) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). An experimental phase diagram of a binary SAM would enable the enrichment or separation of two-dimensional materials based on thermodynamic conditions, as well as the design of surfaces with deliberate preformed patterns. SAMs of organothiol compounds on noble metal surfaces are model two-dimensional systems that have been extensively characterized and utilized in numerous applications. However, as SAM functionalities have been extended, central questions about the mechanism of SAM phase behavior remain unanswered. An experimental phase diagram for a binary SAM has never been reported because it is very difficult to control the composition of a binary SAM. Therefore, this project begins by creating a library of binary monolayers composed of aliphatic and aromatic organothiols on the (111) surface of gold. The structure of the SAM is to be molecularly resolved using STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy) in ambient conditions, and contact angle measurements will be made to quantify the ordering properties of the SAM. Once this library is established, a model binary monolayer of known composition will be constructed. The composition of the monolayer will be interrogated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and reductive desorption. An experimental phase diagram will then be constructed by correlating the phases present in this model binary monolayer to the chemical composition of the monolayer at different temperatures. The accuracy of the resulting phase diagram will be tested by using it to predict the monolayer structure of novel SAMs. The broader impacts of this work will include the training and mentoring of undergraduate students in chemical research. In addition, Dr. Avila-Bront is establishing a community outreach program and expanding remote outreach to elementary schools--including a program where undergraduate students work with elementary students on science-fair projects-- with virtual workshops aimed at encouraging critical assessment of science in the popular media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, cost reductions in LIBs have been mostly driven by economies-of-scale, but these reductions are now reaching a plateau. To further drive down costs, this SBIR project will demonstrate a coating innovation that improves battery capacity and lifetime while eliminating certain costly and time-consuming bottlenecks that exist in current LIB manufacturing. The combined result of these enhancements will be a LIB with greatly reduced cost per kWh relative to the state of the art, ultimately enabling cost-competitive electric vehicles as well as widespread renewable energy storage.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will focus on the application of protective thin-film coatings on LIB electrodes using a low-cost, easily integrated process.

Agricultural land productivity has increased approximately 3-fold in the past 60 years, due to a combination of crop breeding and genetic engineering, adoption of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and irrigation. By expanding understanding of plant developmental biology, the technology developed via this project will increase productivity by 300-fold over current practices via high density cultivation of only the edible fruits of plants, not the supporting roots, leaves, or stems. The innovation will enable indoor fruit production independent of local climate and growing seasons. Controlled environment fruit crop cultivation will alleviate food insecurity and food deserts, creating a decentralized, resilient global food production system, even in industrial areas or non-arable land. Concurrently, land formerly used for conventional agriculture can be restored to natural ecosystems, and water supplies will no longer be subjected to contamination by agrichemicals. Additionally, controlled environment fruit crop cultivation will combat climate change by making soil management unnecessary, which could decrease annual greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by 5%, or 325 M metric tons CO2 equivalent. This project represents an expansion beyond traditional agriculture: that a seed or cutting must be grown to regenerate a full plant, from which products and seeds or cuttings can then be harvested, repeating indefinitely. <br/><br/>The proposed project will advance the frontier of understanding of flower and fruit development in sweet cherry, and example of a fruit tree species that normally requires years of growth in an orchard setting before sufficient flowering occurs and fruit can be harvested. The anticipated results will prove the feasibility of flower formation in the absence of other plant structures, demonstrating the application of plant biotechnology to adapt fruit tree species to controlled environment agriculture. The goals of the project are to generate totipotent plant cells and induce early flowering from those cells with minimal to no vegetative growth. By combining plant biotechnology techniques, tissue culture media testing and controlled abiotic factors such as light and temperature to recreate the appropriate environment in vitro, plant cells will be directed to form flowers and bypass growth of vegetative structures such as leaves and branches. This project will demonstrate the potential of indoor cultivation of sweet cherry, leading to scaled production of proprietary cherry cultivars, plant growth media, and novel controlled environment agriculture methods.  The proposed project demonstrates a new paradigm, in which a complete plant is never grown, but instead allows isolated production and harvesting of specific plant tissues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Infectious diseases alter the United State's economy, society, and culture in complex ways, and these economic and social changes influence the way a pandemic develops. For example, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic is having substantial economic, educational, social, and societal consequences, including changes in work and housing habits, labor markets, and social justice dialogues. Similarly, the HIV epidemic had a major impact on our society in the 1980's, far beyond those immediately impacted by the virus. Mathematical models help make sense of these complex interactions. Constructing models of such complex socio-economic-epidemiological systems requires experts from the constituent fields to work together. The PIs anticipate the research agenda developed in the workshop will facilitate the research communities to discover new mathematical methods and modeling approaches to jointly forecast epidemiological, economic and social patterns so that future pandemics are mitigated with lower social and economic cost.<br/><br/>The conventional approach to the modelling of infectious diseases is to collect basic life-cycle data on the disease, and to overlay that onto structured population data to predict prevalence patterns, health outcomes, using differential equations, networks, agent-based simulations, or another related modelling approaches. These approaches are quite successful at day-ahead prediction, but aside from largely ad hoc parametric adjustments, these standard approaches have almost no ability to connect to behavioral based interventions. These means that the models are not helpful for measuring the benefits and costs (broadly defined) of non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are critical when novel pathogens emerge.  There is expert knowledge and modeling work, related to epidemics, in economics and social sciences that can be used to better describe transmission, while providing internally consistent connections to society and the economy. But the disciplinary divides are difficult to bridge. There are limits in data collection, including scale, precision, and representativeness. This difficulty has been amplified by the fast growth of the scholarly literature over the last few years. Bringing together a diverse group of scholars, scientists, and modelers will help everybody interested in the field better understand what has been accomplished so far and produce a research agenda for improving mathematical models in human epidemiology in the future.

Understanding their evolution over time is important with changing climate, yet to understand how rivers evolve over longer than human timescales, we need to examine the sedimentary deposits created by ancient rivers. These deposits record the evolution and migration of rivers over long timescales before being buried. However, while external forces such as changing climate and tectonics can influence the evolution of rivers, there are also internally controlled factors related to spatially variable flow and sediment deposition that may shape river deposits. By repurposing 3D acoustic images collected by the energy industry showing river deposits in Earth?s subsurface, we will examine the deposits of ancient coastal rivers to better understand how these important deposits vary over space and time, and why. The results of this work will help us better understand how and why ancient rivers have modified Earth?s surface, and will help us predict future changes. <br/><br/>It has long been recognized that the sedimentary record is often complicated and obscured by time-variable sedimentation, hiatus, and erosion. Exceptions have been recognized primarily at the bedform scale, where local, naturally occurring (autogenic) relief drives rapid sedimentation and preservation. River-channel belts, the sedimentary deposits created by river migration and aggradation over time, are also commonly well preserved at the scale of tens of kilometers. This exceptional preservation is often attributed to external forcings (e.g., subsidence), but autogenic sources of topography at the channel-belt scale have also been recognized and hypothesized to be an important source of autogenic relief. Inter-alluvial-ridge basins may perform this function. To quantify the relative importance of autogenic and allogenic processes in preserving fluvial channel belts, we will use 3D seismic volumes imaging the subsurface of the Gulf of Mexico. Using volumes across the continental shelf, we will map channel belts, build a database of channel-belt geometries, and identify the drivers of their preservation, ultimately tracking the relative importance of autogenic and allogenic processes in preserving channel belts across the Gulf Coast over time. Part of our workflow involves converting analyzed 3D seismic volumes to 3D Numpy arrays, a free, open-source, and easily manipulated dataset, which we will make freely available to make 3D seismic volumes more accessible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Datacenter computing, and its energy use, is projected to continue to grow rapidly, perhaps as fast as doubling every few years. This is simply not sustainable. The Treehouse project aims to improve the energy efficiency of datacenter computing by making datacenter computing energy use accountable to users at a fine-grained level and by reducing unnecessary waste in the most frequently used parts of datacenter computation.<br/> <br/>Treehouse improves datacenter energy efficiency in several ways. Treehouse introduces a new computational abstraction that allows new energy optimizations by both application developers (by making application energy use visible at a fine-grained level) and systems designers (by identifying when energy-efficient optimizations can be safely performed without compromising user goals for application performance and reliability). Additional strategies include reducing unnecessary software bloat, reducing resource stranding, and new algorithms to exploit the opportunity posed by new types of hardware with complex tradeoffs between performance and energy use.<br/> <br/>Beyond better energy and resource management, Treehouse provides end users the tools to understand and reduce their individual carbon use from cloud services. This can fundamentally change the way the cloud computing industry thinks about datacenter energy use. Datacenter operators can provide new energy efficient computing models at lower cost. Treehouse software systems and protocols will be open source. Through outreach and new educational materials, Treehouse will pioneer the training of a new type of energy-aware engineer to meet societal needs for an energy-efficient computing infrastructure.<br/> <br/>Treehouse will produce software artifacts, hardware designs, and the results of running those programs and artifacts.

However, recent research has demonstrated that AI techniques can be manipulated, evaded, and misled. While progress has been made to better understand the trustworthiness and security of AI techniques, little has been done to translate this knowledge to education and training. There is a critical need to foster a qualified cybersecurity workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. This project will address this important issue by designing and implementing a virtual, proactive, and collaborative learning paradigm that can engage learners with different backgrounds. The approach will benefit a wide range of learners, especially underrepresented students. It will also help the general public understand the security implications of AI. This project has the ability to transform education at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI/ML; shed light on explainable AI in cybersecurity; and grow a cybersecurity workforce that possesses AI competencies. Products, including the research findings and curriculum, will be disseminated through a variety of mechanisms, such as workshops, peer-reviewed conferences, and journals. <br/><br/>This project builds research and education capacity through the formation of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and statistics. The team will systematically investigate two cohesive research and education goals. First, an immersive learning environment will be developed to motivate students to explore AI/ML development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects. The proposed learning environment enables an AI/ML mechanism that will provide personalized explanations on the AI/ML outputs by considering the distinct background knowledge of the individual learners.

In this way, the United States is positioned to be a leader in sustainable materials and climate-friendly manufacturing processes. Moreover, the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), which was introduced in 2011, has been widely recognized as one of the most significant developments in materials research over the past decade. Its re-envisioning of how computation, theory, and experiment can work together in never-before-seen ways resulted in a rapid transformation of the working paradigm for both US materials science and engineering and the broader community, which encompasses researchers from other disciplines including chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, and computer science. In particular, its ability to: (a) create vast materials datasets; (b) encourage researchers from disparate disciplines to interact in meaningful ways; and (c) incentivize the open sharing and analysis of data led to the accelerated development of many new classes of materials. This strength can now be leveraged to readily grow key areas of national need. Here, we put forward that sustainable materials development and manufacturing is an international necessity to mitigate the effects of waste in our environment, and it is also a factor in the future economic vitality of many industries.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>By taking an MGI-based approach to sustainable materials and manufacturing, we will address this critical opportunity in a complete way such that one of the biggest challenges facing the nation, and the global community, can be addressed in a holistic manner. To this end, we will host a Square Table (ST) over the course of 2, half-day sessions to discuss strategies for advancing the science of sustainable materials and facilitating the adoption of their capabilities into manufacturing at large under the MGI umbrella. The main goal of implementing the ST concept is to provide structure and self-facilitated interactions among stakeholders who do not typically interact with one another and to bridge gaps that exist between industry, federal agencies, and academia in an open and unbiased manner. In this way, we anticipate that this event will provide a clear picture of the current status and future vision of the sustainable materials and manufacturing community. This ST cuts to the heart of one of the most pressing societal challenges, and it will necessarily bridge across multiple disciplines to have the desired impact. Critically, the organizers of the event recognize the need to welcome a diversity of voices, and they will implement a recruiting plan to attract researchers from a variety of backgrounds such that a diverse and inclusive approach is taken at the outset of addressing an opportunity that affects all people. Importantly, both established and early-career (e.g., postdoctoral researchers and untenured faculty members) researchers will be event participants. Moreover, the ST will ensure that participants will be present from large and small businesses, federal agencies, and host of geographically-disperse academic institutional types including Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will reveal images of viruses, while they are attacking the outside of a cell, similar to an observer flying a helicopter on a battlefield. At the same time, it will be possible to zoom-in so powerfully that the very moment of the virus entry into the cell will be captured. The understanding of this cell-infecting stage depends on documenting it multiple times and in a practical way. It is critical to have the ability to visualize the entry without the limitations of traditional microscopy techniques. Spikes on the surface of the virus play a critical role in the cell insertion step. The visualization task requires specialized tools able to identify the virus itself (approximately 1/1000 the diameter of a human hair), the spike (1/10 of the virus), and tiny features of the cell membrane (comparable to the dimension of the spike). This project employs a new microscope ideally suited to this problem, a ?Helium-ion Microscope? (HeIM). The COVID19 pandemic, and its possible successors, represent an acute emergency. New discoveries and new methods of investigation provide a significant social benefit. This project will establish HeIM as a technique critical to examine the virus-cell interaction for possible future needs. Involvement of students and young scientists in the research, together with its introduction to investigators of viral diseases, provide a mechanism for this new technology to be learned and spread to the broader virology community.<br/><br/>The project will study the SARS-COV-2 virus-cell interaction by using the new imaging modality of Helium-ion Microscopy (HeIM) which allows identification of morphological details superior to other established techniques. In particular, the study will determine the viral density on the cell surface, as it is known that the virus preferentially targets specific cell types, like the Type II Pneumocytes of the lungs. The study will quantify the number of cell-entry and cell-exit events that occur as a function of viral density on the cell surface. In so doing, these measurements will: i) quantify viral cell-entry events, differentiating between ?endocytosis? and ?membrane fusion? and ii) quantify viral cell-exit events, differentiating between ?free-virion? and ?extracellular vesicle? release. Such data provides a basis for COVID19 cell infection modeling and for designing models of therapeutic options. The project will also focus on HeIM use for such studies of optimizing sample preparation, determining procedures for imaging clinical samples, developing bi-directional correlative microscopy with fluorescent-labelled samples which better define the virus-cell biochemistry. <br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While energy has become a metric of interest for mitigating thermal issues or increasing battery life of mobile devices, energy efficiency has largely neglected sustainability and in particular, computing's impact on the environment and energy resources of the planet.  For example, while embodied environmental costs (e.g., carbon emissions) of integrated-circuit (IC) manufacturing often exceed its operational carbon footprint, this is relatively unknown or the reverse is presumed to be true in the computing community. Furthermore, the use of rare metals such as tantalum, tungsten, and gold, in electronic equipment contribute to the inevitable exhaustion of the planet's resources.  There is an urgent need to consider factors beyond operational-phase energy consumption of the computing infrastructure to truly combat carbon and other harmful emissions present during the full computing lifecycle to combat the existential threat of climate change. <br/> <br/>This project proposes a series of community oriented activities culminating in a workshop to both increase awareness among researchers in the domain of computing about these factors of sustainable computing and to specify the challenges and potential possible solutions to achieve sustainable computing including, but also beyond the operational phase of the computing technology.  A particular goal will be to facilitate cross pollination of ideas among researchers across different disciplines encompassing not only computing sciences but also, environmental sciences and political sciences to identify sustainable methodologies for design and operation of computing infrastructure. The novelty and intellectual merit of this project is in identifying gaps in knowledge that need to be bridged to truly make computers sustainable.  In particular, this project will start with a series of invited talks from experts from diverse fields with deep insights on these aspects that ultimately affect the sustainability of computing resources targeted at computing researchers.  These talks will be delivered remotely with an online platform. Following these enlightening talks, this project will host an in-person workshop bringing computing researchers together to discuss the lessons learned from the talks and how these ideas can be incorporated in various types of computing devices from low power miniature systems such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to warehouse-scale computers such as data centers.

Treasured for their biodiversity, beauty, and other services they provide society, these freshwater wetlands will evolve from forest to marsh to open water as sea level rises. The pace of this transition over the coming decades isn?t yet known, and it is likely that even small changes in the interaction between coastal landscapes and their rivers will lead to very different impacts affecting public lands, private property, and environmental management of watersheds and estuaries. Society will be better positioned to adapt to these impacts by preparing in two ways. First, exploring how the settling of mud, silt, and sand from rivers and estuaries builds the elevation of tidal wetlands, especially wetlands at the farthest upstream reach of tides, will help pinpoint where (and possibly when) major changes to these wetlands will occur. Second, educating coastal populations on why their coastal landscapes are changing and training them to measure and monitor these changes will strengthen local decision-making and empower scientists and coastal managers to more precisely target environmental protections.<br/><br/>This project will measure the immediate source of suspended sediment in the fluvial tidal and saline zones of estuaries, particularly during river floods. These measurements will help answer notoriously challenging questions about the connectivity of rivers with their estuaries, such as ?how far do river-borne particles travel into estuaries during river floods, and what proportion of the suspended sediment do these particles comprise in the saline estuary?? The answers will reveal as much about the time scale of particle movements as the spatial scales of river and estuarine influence. The recent origin of sediment particles will be assessed using high throughput DNA sequencing of the particle-associated microbial community. The advantage of this technique is that sediment particles of identical mineralogy and chemical composition can be traced to their most recent source (freshwater, tidal freshwater, benthic, wetland, saline estuary). Synoptic surveys of particle-associated microbial DNA along the riverine-estuarine transition of two tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay will be interpreted using results from laboratory incubation and mixing experiments with suspended sediment from various sources and water matrices. The spatial and temporal patterns of sediment mixing will be generalized and applied to predict vulnerability of freshwater tidal wetlands on the US east coast.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Migrating to hydrogen fuel may significantly reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the transportation sector, but several challenges remain in the economic and practical benefits compared to traditional carbon-based internal combustion engines. Conformable tanks are poised to address the concerns relative to high pressure storage of hydrogen. Providing additional sustainable fuel options will reduce carbon emissions. <br/><br/>This objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to address two technical areas relative to the practical use of conformable tanks to store hydrogen at high pressure.

For conformable tanks, this problem is confounded by the stratification of gas pockets within various parts of the tank. The first goal of this project is to build and test a physical test specimen to validate an innovative approach to thermal management during fast fill events for conformable tanks. Additionally, a conformable tank without epoxy resins in the reinforcement overwrap provides improved weight efficiency and safety benefits.

Healthcare organizations need analytic tools to help manage the needs and risks of entire populations. New technologies and scientific advancements are needed to improve national health and prosperity.<br/><br/>A partnership between Indiana University, The Ohio State University, and University of Florida, The Center for Population Health Analytics & Technology (CPHAT) will advance technologies, knowledge, and methods that improve health and wellbeing related to social determinants of health, population health analytics, and addiction. CPHAT will produce tools that support clinical and business decision making, models to identify and support high-risk populations, analytics that address health inequities, and interventions for addiction. The Ohio State University Site will develop tools that support both clinical care and business decision making models that better meet the needs of high-risk populations, analytics responsive to the inequities experienced by vulnerable populations, and develop new interventions to address the social and health needs prompted by addiction.<br/><br/>The CPHAT will have a positive impact on the well-being of individuals in society by improving the effectiveness and the equity of US health care. The CPHAT will partner with innovative industry members to develop the science and technology necessary to deal with the social and behavioral drivers of poor health. Population health is a dramatic departure from traditional approaches in that it specifically focuses on improving health outcomes and health equity for all individuals. In addition, the CPHAT will further the NSF?s goal of increased partnership between academia and industry.<br/><br/>The CPHAT will maintain project repositories for the duration of the project period. Each university partner site will maintain individual and shared project repositories consistent with data sharing and usage agreements. A centrally-hosted project repository will include all CPHAT project results, publications, and related products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The efficiency of current LEDs drastically decreases from ?80% in the blue-light regions to ?15% in the green region. This lack of a suitable semiconductor green light source is known as the ?green gap? problem. This research aims to address this problem by developing green LEDs based on an entirely new family of semiconductor materials called chalcogenide perovskite. The proposed work is a critical step towards opening a new frontier in semiconductor device research based on chalcogenide perovskites, with far reaching impacts on applications such as sensing, energy harvesting, information processing, and storage. The use of earth-abundant elements in these materials can reduce our nation?s reliance on rare-earth materials. Through collaboration with local industry, the proposed work will also develop samples and instrumentation for advanced laboratory courses, which will not only impact STEM education in the US and worldwide, but also the local economy in Western New York. The research activities involving machine learning, first-principles computation, material synthesis, device fabrication, and characterization, will offer important interdisciplinary training to a broad student body.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to demonstrate the first chalcogenide perovskite-based light emitting diodes, with the long-term goal of bridging the green gap in LED technology. This will involve an iterative process in which theoretical prediction will guide material synthesis and atomic level structural, optical, and carrier transport characterization will inform theoretical models as well as device design and fabrication. The idea of this work was conceived based on the principal investigators' recent prediction and realization of chalcogenide perovskite materials with tunable band gap and promising semiconducting properties. The specific project objectives are to: i) Develop a low temperature chalcogenide perovskite thin-film processing technique compatible with device fabrication and growing high quality SrHfS3 and SrZrS3 thin films with strong green and amber light emission. ii) Control device properties through concerted first-principles computation and experiments of atomic scale structural, optical, and carrier transport characteristic. iii) Design, fabricate, and evaluate green and amber LEDs from n- and p- type doped SrHfS3 and SrZrS3 thin films. An innovative device fabrication technique incorporating micro-transfer-printing allows for dissimilar materials to form a high-quality p-i-n type LED structure with extremely clean interfaces without being constrained by their growth conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a need to continually blend Indigenous ways of knowing with western scientific approaches to biodiversity conservation; however, Indigenous populations are severely underrepresented in scientific fields. This project fills that need by providing opportunities for Native American students to use their backgrounds while gaining scientific expertise and global experience from other knowledge systems by participating in two, 13-day Advanced Study Institutes (ASI?s) in India that focus on providing hands-on and field-based research and learning opportunities in wildlife management and natural resource conservation sciences. Each ASI will have 10 U.S. graduate student participants and the same number of participants from India per year. U.S. participants are limited to those who identify as Native American; to be chosen through a competitive process. The objective of the ASI?s is to provide Native American graduate students a global perspective and opportunities for professional growth through significant international collaborative research training, mentoring and networking in the fields of wildlife and natural resource conservation sciences. The significance of this project is that it brings together Native American students, Indian students, and faculty from the US and India to provide a multi-cultural, dynamic learning experience designed to build the competencies of Native American students in social and biophysical sciences. This project also offers an opportunity for a traditionally underrepresented student population to work with fellow Indigenous students in building community and global awareness where their unique perspective is needed to help solve complex problems not only in the U.S. and in India, but worldwide. The ASI?s will train students to conduct multidisciplinary research in an international context, building young professionals who will be at the forefront of world conservation and wildlife management sciences. These students will then be equipped to apply their scientific background to advance the health and welfare of Native American lands and people. <br/><br/>The research themes for the ASI?s are founded in social-ecological systems thinking and include social and biophysical sciences. The ASI?s will cover technical aspects, biophysical aspects and human dimensions. These include indigenous and participatory perspectives on conservation, conservation biology, landscape ecology, ecological restoration, and wildlife management. The project provides the integration of science and technologies to consider both ecological principles and environmental conditions with the aim of balancing the needs of wildlife with the needs of the people. Students will study each of these themes first in the classroom and then through field experiences by leveraging the unique research facilities and field sites available through our partner institution, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), a global leader in applied research in wildlife management and natural resource conservation sciences. Students will participate in a virtual conference and workshop before traveling to India. While in India, participants will be encouraged to participate in cultural experiences that will expose them to the history and culture of India, providing context to their work. A web-based virtual learning platform will be built for the ASIs and used for recruitment, participant networking, virtual conferences and workshops, and provide a summary of the activities and outcomes.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Courses and workshops are emerging to meet this need, but there is no published work addressing the content that needs to be taught and how to teach that content to develop a workforce at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. This project addresses the gap in our understanding of how to prepare the workforce to apply AI to problems in cybersecurity by identifying workforce needs and developing solutions to learning barriers that could prevent broad participation in AI-enhanced cybersecurity. The project will create and disseminate an AI-enhanced cybersecurity course for advanced undergraduate and master's students and contribute new knowledge at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and education.<br/><br/>This project will identify workforce training needs for AI-enhanced cybersecurity through interviews with industry experts. This will inform the development of a course for master's and advanced undergraduate students that addresses gaps in existing cybersecurity curricular frameworks. The hands-on course will serve as a testbed to identify key conceptual challenges, prerequisites, and compelling examples of AI-enhanced cybersecurity. The course will train students at the University of Washington Bothell in crucial AI-enhanced cybersecurity skills. Additionally, the project seeks to identify opportunities to broaden participation at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. A better understanding of how computing majors perceive courses and careers in AI, cybersecurity, and the intersection of the two can inform efforts to broaden participation in AI-enhanced cybersecurity.

Indeed, social experiences cause numerous changes in physiology, and physiological changes influence cognition and behavior. Most research in this area has focused on the cardiovascular, endocrine, and nervous systems. This project focuses on the immune system ? a powerful physiological system with connections to social life that are less often the focus of research. Understanding interactions between the immune system and social experiences may hold the key to understanding the impacts of racial discrimination, social stress, social connection, and social aggression on health, well-being, and productivity. Specifically, the current research considers the ways in which both negative and positive social experiences are interconnected with the immune system. Relating to negative social experiences, the project examines whether a simulated experience of racial discrimination leads to increases in inflammation and reductions in immune system functioning among Black Americans. The research also examines whether a naturally-occurring challenge to the immune system, the flu vaccine, causes an increase in social defeat behavior in aggressive social interactions. With regard to positive social experiences, the research explores the potential buffering effect of support-giving on the negative immune-related impacts of stress, as well as how an immune challenge influences behavior in interactions with both close others and strangers. More broadly, the project contributes new and refined methods for measuring and manipulating the immune system, contributing to the broader scientific community involved in research on connections between social experiences and the immune system.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to integrate theory and methods from experimental social psychology and psychoneuroimmunology to advance the burgeoning field of ?social psychoneuroimmunology?. Three experimental studies test four key hypotheses that build on foundational research in animals and a small but critical empirical literature in humans. The studies examine the bi-directional connections between the immune system and both negative and positive social experiences. The negative experiences upon which the research focuses include race-related stress and social defeat. The positive social experiences include providing social support to a loved one and interacting with a close-other. The project also seeks to refine and advance methods for measuring and manipulating the immune system. As an alternative to methods that depend on collection of blood samples and intensive immune challenges, this project develops the viability of simpler assessments (based on dried blood spots, histamine skin pricks, and commonly-administered vaccines) that offer greater potential for widespread utilization. The new techniques will be made accessible to other researchers, expanding opportunities for further advances in the field. The project addresses some of the most pressing questions facing society today, including how race-related stress impacts the immune system to influence health, well-being, and education outcomes for diverse Americans, and how the fundamental human need of connecting with others influences and is influenced by the immune system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding sweat loss and calculating hydration requirements to avoid dehydration or overhydration is a significant challenge for athletes.  This is because sweat losses vary significantly from athlete to athlete both in terms of concentration of electrolytes and total volume of sweat lost.  When sweating, an individual may lose as little as ~200mg of sodium per liter or as much as ~2000 mg.

Many volcanoes that pose great risks to large populations are well studied and highly monitored with scientific instruments, but there is still a fundamental lack of understanding of many basic aspects of the Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira systems. This investigation will improve our understanding of these systems by focusing on (1) how magma forms beneath the two volcanoes, (2) how deeply and for how long magma is stored beneath the volcanoes before eruption, (3) what triggers eruptions to occur on the flanks of the volcanoes, in and near populated areas, and (4) how fast magma moves towards the surface during an eruption and how much warning time people would have in advance of an eruption. In addition to these aspects focused on hazards, this project will investigate the source of the carbon that is released as carbon dioxide by these volcanoes. Large amounts of carbon are likely stored in solid minerals inside the Earth beneath thick, old continental crust like that in East Africa, and when the crust gets pulled apart by rifting as in the East African Rift, the carbon contributes to magma formation. Nyiragongo is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide gas of any volcano worldwide, and better understanding the connection between carbon in minerals and magma formation beneath this volcano will help us better understand the Earth?s deep carbon cycle. Much of the research for this project will be conducted by graduate students at the University of Oregon and University of Wyoming as part of their scientific training. Collaboration with scientists at the Goma Volcano Observatory in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will include periodic videoconferences to share research results important for volcanic hazards monitoring. Public engagement will include a National Geographic Explorer?s Blog and several short articles for a general audience on volcanic hazards at Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira and release of carbon dioxide from volcanoes.<br/><br/>In detail, the primary goals of this project are (1) to understand the time-integrated effects of lithospheric metasomatism on magma generation beneath Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira, and (2) to use the results as the starting point for a source-to-surface investigation of the plumbing systems, magma storage timescales, eruption triggering processes, and magma ascent rates for these volcanoes. Although these volcanoes are only 15 km apart, their eruption behavior and the types of lava they emit are profoundly different, with Nyiragongo erupting some of the most unusual lava types found anywhere on Earth. To understand the roles of lithospheric mantle and metasomatic veins as magma sources, we will use existing major and trace element and isotopic data together with new data on volatile contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions to establish parental melt compositions and source lithologies. Our data and modeling approach will also provide important constraints on parental magma CO2 and S concentrations and magma fluxes for each volcano. Our proposed work will use existing tephra and lava samples and will focus on the many parasitic cones and tuff rings on the flanks of Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira, as these erupt more primitive compositions than the volcanoes? central vents. For investigating the plumbing systems, we will use (1) melt inclusion volatile data to determine crystallization depths, (2) U-series mineral isochrons to determine crystal and magma residence times, (3) mineral zoning and diffusion chronometry to identify recharge and mixing processes that may trigger eruptions and yield precursory seismic signals, and (4) diffusive loss of H from melt inclusions to infer magma ascent rates during eruption, which likely influence explosivity. Our overarching goal is to produce geologically well-grounded, state-of-the-art geochemical and petrological data that improves our understanding of these volcanic systems and thereby improves hazard assessment models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Infectious diseases alter the United State's economy, society, and culture in complex ways, and these economic and social changes influence the way a pandemic develops. For example, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic is having substantial economic, educational, social, and societal consequences, including changes in work and housing habits, labor markets, and social justice dialogues. Similarly, the HIV epidemic had a major impact on our society in the 1980's, far beyond those immediately impacted by the virus. Mathematical models help make sense of these complex interactions. Constructing models of such complex socio-economic-epidemiological systems requires experts from the constituent fields to work together. The PIs anticipate the research agenda developed in the workshop will facilitate the research communities to discover new mathematical methods and modeling approaches to jointly forecast epidemiological, economic and social patterns so that future pandemics are mitigated with lower social and economic cost.<br/><br/>The conventional approach to the modelling of infectious diseases is to collect basic life-cycle data on the disease, and to overlay that onto structured population data to predict prevalence patterns, health outcomes, using differential equations, networks, agent-based simulations, or another related modelling approaches. These approaches are quite successful at day-ahead prediction, but aside from largely ad hoc parametric adjustments, these standard approaches have almost no ability to connect to behavioral based interventions. These means that the models are not helpful for measuring the benefits and costs (broadly defined) of non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are critical when novel pathogens emerge.  There is expert knowledge and modeling work, related to epidemics, in economics and social sciences that can be used to better describe transmission, while providing internally consistent connections to society and the economy. But the disciplinary divides are difficult to bridge. There are limits in data collection, including scale, precision, and representativeness. This difficulty has been amplified by the fast growth of the scholarly literature over the last few years. Bringing together a diverse group of scholars, scientists, and modelers will help everybody interested in the field better understand what has been accomplished so far and produce a research agenda for improving mathematical models in human epidemiology in the future.

Until recently, observing these biogeochemical (BGC) changes across remote ocean areas with seasonal to interannual resolution has been impractical due to the prohibitive costs associated with large-scale ship operations. Now robotic profiling floats have been developed that are equipped with chemical and biological sensors, and which can operate independently for years.  These robotic systems provide us the ability to observe changing ocean chemistry and biology in real time. This proposal will provide the funds to operate for five years an array of 500 such profiling floats that are distributed across the global ocean.   <br/><br/>The Global Ocean Biogeochemistry (GO-BGC) Array was funded through the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-2 program to deploy 500 biogeochemical (BGC) profiling floats around the globe. Each float will be equipped with a suite of chemical and biological sensors for oxygen, nitrate, pH, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical backscatter, and, in most cases, irradiance. The unprecedented real-time data stream from the GO-BGC Array will enable observation of ocean biogeochemical changes with seasonal to interannual resolution through the upper 2 km of the ocean, driving a transformative shift in scientific and public understanding of marine biogeochemical cycling and ocean health at the global scale.  However, the MSRI-2 project does not provide funds to operate the array.  Operational costs are centered on the expenses needed to transmit the large data stream from floats through the Iridium satellite communication system and the expenses to operate a data system that quality controls the incoming measurements and distributes the resulting, science quality data in real time.  These data are then available without restriction.  This proposal will provide the needed costs to transmit data from the GO-BGC array. It will support the quality control of float data streams to ensure that a high quality, science-ready data set is easily available to the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These proteins need to rapidly scan DNA and yet slow down at potential ?trouble spots? to recognize damage to begin repair. This process is complicated by the fact that DNA inside cells is looped and supercoiled (unwound or overwound). This project aims to uncover how DNA looping and supercoiling impact the interactions of DNA repair proteins with damaged DNA. The findings and the technologies developed in these studies will open doors for understanding how other proteins, such as those that regulate gene expression, engage with supercoiled DNA. The project will have educational impacts by providing opportunities for diverse undergraduate and graduate students to take part in cross-disciplinary cutting-edge research; developing an interdisciplinary undergraduate program in biophysics; engaging with high school teachers to develop teaching modules at the interface between physics and biology; and hosting high school students in their laboratories in the summer. Public and outreach activities will include a weekly ?Saturday Morning Science? to bring in high school students to talk about science. <br/><br/>A molecular-level understanding of DNA damage recognition is lacking, in large part because measurements of protein-DNA conformational dynamics on micro-to-milliseconds timescales relevant for interrogation and recognition are difficult and, thus, rare. Several lines of evidence suggest that damage sensing proteins sense differences in local DNA fluctuations and deformability to distinguish damaged from undamaged sites. Characterizing DNA dynamics and flexibility, however, has been a major challenge in the field. Even rarer are studies on how DNA topology (looping and supercoiling) ? conserved across the domains of life ? influence these dynamics. Using innovative fluorescence approaches that include laser temperature-jump, fluorescence lifetime-based FRET, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, this project will build on previous studies in the PI?s laboratory that unveiled protein-DNA conformational dynamics en route to damage recognition by Rad4, yeast ortholog of xeroderma pigmentosum C protein in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Studies for mismatch recognition by MutS protein in the mismatch repair pathway will measure DNA dynamics for different mismatches, visualize how MutS engages with the mismatched sites, and ascertain whether mismatch interrogation/recognition rates for different mismatches correlate with MutS-mediated repair efficiencies. DNA minicircles designed with controlled superhelicity will be used to investigate the effect of looping and supercoiling on DNA fluctuations and what impact that has on the thermodynamics and kinetics of damage recognition by Rad4/MutS.  The exquisitely high sensitivity and temporal resolution of these studies will enable measurements of Rad4/MutS-mediated kinking, unwinding, nucleotide-flipping kinetics at mismatched sites to form the recognition complex, shed light on how these dynamics are altered when DNA is supercoiled, and provide answers to how intrinsic DNA fluctuations stall and communicate ?distress signals? to damage sensing proteins.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and the Molecular Biophysics Programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop novel AI techniques to equip systems with the perception intelligence to understand what happened and predict what will happen, and the prescription intelligence to understand how the system changes. The research outcomes can help computers to better assess situations, forecast trends, detect anomalies, discover causality, simulate system behaviors, and, moreover, prevent, mitigate, and eliminate threats to the system.

This will have important consequences for predicting the success of an individual tree depending on its proximity to individuals with the same and different variants of pathogen resistance genes.  This knowledge has important implications for forest ecology and will provide new insights about the best planting arrangements for all types of plant species that have well characterized pathogen resistance genotypes.

The research will model new mechanisms of positive feedback in a range of settings, validate these results using data from public agencies and private firms, and leverage this information for improved control of pooled transportation systems. The knowledge obtained can be used to develop and refine pricing, taxation, and other policy strategies that can both promote pooling and reduce urban traffic congestion. Improving carpool options can also improve environmental outcomes, by reducing vehicle travel, and social equity, by providing reasonable travel times to those who cannot buy or drive a car but who do not live close to convenient transit options. The education and outreach plan includes recruiting students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to work on the research tasks and provide them with opportunities to mentor junior colleagues on research activities. The research will develop interactive web modules to describe these carpooling behaviors to a wide audience. <br/><br/>The research will specifically focus on two mechanisms of positive feedback in carpooling. The first is hyperdemand, whereby the share of people choosing to carpool both depends on and affects traffic congestion. The second are matching externalities, whereby the quality of matches among carpoolers increases as more choose to carpool. The research will break new ground by bringing to bear tools from dynamical systems, search/matching theory and network-level traffic relations to build a robust theory of carpooling.  To validate the theory, the research team will use empirical data collected from open data sources, as well as our industry partners.

There are two sources of energy within the Earth: the primordial energy and radiogenic energy. Primordial energy is the kinetic energy that comes from heating during a collision: particle to particle, small planet to small planet, and big planet to big planet collisions. A simple estimate of this energy, derived from the velocity of meteorites and the mass of the earth, gives 1032 joules, or more than a trillion, trillion times the power of all nuclear power plants in existence. Unfortunately, we lack a fuel gauge for either energy source and consequently we do not know how much power is left to drive the earth's engine, nor how much energy (and time) is left to keep it habitable. Geoneutrinos are naturally occurring electron antineutrinos produced during beta-decays of these heat producing elements. These neutrinos are tiny fundamental particles that are almost impossible to detect, because they are about a billion times smaller than a proton, near-massless and chargeless. In 2005, particle physicists first detected the earth's emission of geoneutrinos with large underground detectors and are now telling us about the amount of radiogenic heat inside the earth. Reading the earth's fuel gauge by counting geoneutrinos, however, requires that geologists understand the abundance and distribution of these heat producing elements in the continents and the mantle.By quantifying the planet?s geoneutrino flux we can establish precisely its composition and define the meteoritic building blocks used to construct the Earth. Competing theoretical models of the Earth?s composition will be unbiasedly interrogated by neutrino technology and tell us which of the competing chemical models of the Earth is the right one. New results from geoneutrino detectors in Japan and Italy present contrasting stories as to how much fuel is left in the earth's engine. Geologists are addressing these complexities by building 3-D physical and chemical models of the earth?s continents. We seek to resolve these complexities. This award will fund the research of a graduate student and the outreach efforts of the PI.<br/> <br/>Debate continues regarding the convective power of earth's mantle and the abundances of radiogenic elements in the earth. The earth has a nonuniform 3D physical and compositional structure. Consequently, there is minimal consistency between heat production models. Data from current and planned geoneutrino detectors (major 100?s of million dollars particle physics experiments) can bring resolution to several major issues in earth sciences which we seek to answer:<br/>1. what are the building blocks used to make the planet;<br/>2. what is the proportion of radiogenic heat relative to the residual heat of accretion and core formation;<br/>3. what is the fraction of radiogenic heat in the continental crust relative to that in the mantle; and<br/>4. what is the composition of the bulk silicate earth, and its present upper and lower mantle?<br/>Answers to these questions will, in turn, define the power that drives plate tectonics, mantle convection and the geodynamo. From this we will also get insights into the structure of mantle convection. Neutrino geoscience offers a potential to address broad interdisciplinary issues over conventional methods. Geoneutrino measurements sample the globe and are not confounded by mantle melting processes. The current debate about the mantle's Urey ratio (values ranging from 0.1 to 0.8; where UR = (radiogenic mantle power)/(total - crustal radiogenic power)) confound predictions for the Earth's abundances of chondritic refractory elements (36 elements, including Ca, Al, Th, & U), its cooling rate, and the onset of plate tectonics. Having geoscientists working with physicists to determine the crustal model for the geoneutrino signal and the mantle's contribution to heat production will promote mutually beneficial interdisciplinary collaborations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This coastal region is at the junction of unique vulnerabilities, including an important border and the presence of several ports where large quantities of chemicals and fossil fuels are handled. Sea level rise and the associated ground's surface settling downward (subsidence) and extreme weather such as hurricanes are further challenges to infrastructure, whether hard (built) or soft (natural, like oyster reefs or marshes). The vulnerability of the regional infrastructure has been highlighted dramatically by recent winter storms that brought down the power grid and access to potable drinking water. This project?s focus is a conference that exposes infrastructure-oriented researchers to their infrastructure-focused counterparts from the social, behavioral and economic (SBE) fields. Broader impacts include the development of a science communication kit for participants.<br/><br/>Using evidence-informed communicative frameworks, the conference arms participants with skills to better convey their specific knowledge to non-expert audiences in their communities on decisions like understanding the impact of subsidence and sea level rise on building zoning decisions. The project lays the groundwork for infrastructure-focused scientists and engineers to better engage with community stakeholders and understand what knowledge and values they bring to the decision-making process. The conference fosters convergence in areas of the built and soft infrastructure of coastal regions by bringing SBE scientists alongside natural and physical scientists and engineers. The common foci (such as flooding and groundwater quality, or hurricanes and extreme weather) integrate human- and-social-centered approaches to the infrastructure by concentrating on key issues, theories, and methodologies from SBE perspectives. Situating the conference at a local Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and recruiting participants from regional HSIs enhance communications on critical infrastructure issues between scientists and engineers and the coastal communities.

New concepts for the design of complex ring synthesis drive this project. This work combines computational and experimental components to allow training of specialists in each area. The project will provide researchers at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels with an opportunity to integrate learning and discovery. The results will be disseminated through publications and outreach activities, including participation in public lectures, scientific symposia, giving talks at industries, undergraduate and graduate institutions, as well as recording educational videos.<br/><br/>This proposal sets out to develop new approaches to the rapid construction of functionalized polycyclic aromatics by using the residual strain of helicenes and selectively generated high-energy reactive intermediates such as antiaromatic species, excited states and vinyl radicals. Furthermore, the Alabugin research team is aiming to complement available purely hexagonal graphenic networks with selectively introduced pentagonal fusions as a way to design negatively charged carbon-rich materials. Professor Alabugin and his co-workers will also work to expand the scope of the double-annulation reactions under study such that, in a one-pot operation, the transformation effectively converts monosubstituted benzenes into pyrenes and pyrene analogues with precisely placed functional groups and heteroatoms.  If successful, this multi-faceted transformation would open up one of the most efficient examples of complex functional group-tolerant benzannulation chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through a low-footprint vertical greenhouse design, this technology will enable individuals to grow produce on small areas of available space for their community. The produce will be an attractive alternative to large-scale industrial agriculture and foreign food imports, not only for sustainability concerns, but through its superior freshness, quality, and taste. This project will have an impact on the advancement of local farming technologies to further the viability of commercial food production in urban communities. Creating an economically viable urban farm will have lasting impacts on the U.S. food system and environment as it will provide a means for sustainable food production.<br/><br/>The Phase I effort will be used to design, build, and demonstrate a subscale vertical farm prototype that demonstrates cost-effective methods for all aspects of the farm?s end-to-end labor automation. This will advance the implementation of robotics in food production by addressing the labor and energy barriers that local controlled environmental agriculture systems currently face. To achieve this objective, key challenges include (1) automation to completely remove human labor over extended durations, (2) low-cost design for setup and ongoing operations, and (3) the ability to adjust product outputs in real-time to market demands. Human interaction with the grow process will be limited through high degree of system automation, including computer vision for plant inspections and self-cleaning processes. Novel plant growth and handling processes will allow for virtually any type of produce. A variety of sensors are used to carefully monitor conditions and adjust the system, allowing fresh produce in areas without suitable agricultural opportunities.

While the cloud?s energy demand grew more slowly than expected over the past decade due to aggressive energy-efficiency optimizations, there are few remaining optimization opportunities using traditional methods. As a result, the cloud?s continued exponential growth will translate into exponentially rising energy demand, which will position it as one of the primary contributors to global carbon emissions. To address the problem, this project elevates carbon to a first-class metric in designing a sustainable and reliable cloud-edge software infrastructure that can enable continued exponential growth.<br/><br/>The project's foundation is a software-defined energy virtualization layer that provides applications visibility into, and control of, their own energy and carbon usage. The project will leverage this foundation to develop higher-level systems abstractions for supporting carbon-efficient applications at different geographical scales including: a cluster balloon technique, which automatically adjusts applications? energy usage to match a volatile clean energy supply at local edge sites; edge hopping mechanisms, which exploit lower regional energy volatility to balance energy across edge sites; and carbon capping policies, which track applications? global grid carbon emissions and restrict grid energy after reaching the cap.<br/><br/>The project has the potential for significant societal impact by enabling commercial cloud platforms to sustainably continue their exponential growth.  The project will conduct outreach by incorporating topics from the proposal into summer programs for local middle and high school students at the partner institutions. The project will also impact the curriculum at these institutions by adopting elements of edge, cloud, and sustainable computing into graduate and advanced undergraduate courses.  Finally, the project will recruit a diverse group of students by leveraging institutional diversity efforts and will involve undergraduate students through Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) projects.<br/><br/>The project will make its software artifacts, datasets, and research results available to the research community on the project website at http://www.carbonfirst.org and via the UMass Trace Repository  at http://traces.cs.umass.edu.

Most computing is done in centralized hubs called datacenters.  Datacenters consume an estimated 1-2% of worldwide electricity production. Datacenter computing, and its energy use, is projected to continue to grow rapidly, perhaps as fast as doubling every few years. This is simply not sustainable. The Treehouse project aims to improve the energy efficiency of datacenter computing by making datacenter computing energy use accountable to users at a fine-grained level and by reducing unnecessary waste in the most frequently used parts of datacenter computation.<br/> <br/>Treehouse improves datacenter energy efficiency in several ways. Treehouse introduces a new computational abstraction that allows new energy optimizations by both application developers (by making application energy use visible at a fine-grained level) and systems designers (by identifying when energy-efficient optimizations can be safely performed without compromising user goals for application performance and reliability). Additional strategies include reducing unnecessary software bloat, reducing resource stranding, and new algorithms to exploit the opportunity posed by new types of hardware with complex tradeoffs between performance and energy use.<br/> <br/>Beyond better energy and resource management, Treehouse provides end users the tools to understand and reduce their individual carbon use from cloud services. This can fundamentally change the way the cloud computing industry thinks about datacenter energy use. Datacenter operators can provide new energy efficient computing models at lower cost. Treehouse software systems and protocols will be open source. Through outreach and new educational materials, Treehouse will pioneer the training of a new type of energy-aware engineer to meet societal needs for an energy-efficient computing infrastructure.<br/> <br/>Treehouse will produce software artifacts, hardware designs, and the results of running those programs and artifacts.

While energy has become a metric of interest for mitigating thermal issues or increasing battery life of mobile devices, energy efficiency has largely neglected sustainability and in particular, computing's impact on the environment and energy resources of the planet.  For example, while embodied environmental costs (e.g., carbon emissions) of integrated-circuit (IC) manufacturing often exceed its operational carbon footprint, this is relatively unknown or the reverse is presumed to be true in the computing community. Furthermore, the use of rare metals such as tantalum, tungsten, and gold, in electronic equipment contribute to the inevitable exhaustion of the planet's resources.  There is an urgent need to consider factors beyond operational-phase energy consumption of the computing infrastructure to truly combat carbon and other harmful emissions present during the full computing lifecycle to combat the existential threat of climate change. <br/> <br/>This project proposes a series of community oriented activities culminating in a workshop to both increase awareness among researchers in the domain of computing about these factors of sustainable computing and to specify the challenges and potential possible solutions to achieve sustainable computing including, but also beyond the operational phase of the computing technology.  A particular goal will be to facilitate cross pollination of ideas among researchers across different disciplines encompassing not only computing sciences but also, environmental sciences and political sciences to identify sustainable methodologies for design and operation of computing infrastructure. The novelty and intellectual merit of this project is in identifying gaps in knowledge that need to be bridged to truly make computers sustainable.  In particular, this project will start with a series of invited talks from experts from diverse fields with deep insights on these aspects that ultimately affect the sustainability of computing resources targeted at computing researchers.  These talks will be delivered remotely with an online platform. Following these enlightening talks, this project will host an in-person workshop bringing computing researchers together to discuss the lessons learned from the talks and how these ideas can be incorporated in various types of computing devices from low power miniature systems such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to warehouse-scale computers such as data centers.

This project uniquely combines two new technologies to eliminate the carbon dioxide emissions resulting from flaring of huge volumes of natural gas in remote oil fields; the technologies burn it in a novel combustion system and uses the generated heat to treat the oil-field produced water. The cooled flue gases of combustion are then injected via a novel process into oilfields for enhancing oil recovery. This makes the entire process economically feasible and environmentally beneficial. <br/><br/>The proposed combustion system involves a novel concept of ?Fire-in-Water? to carry out combustion of a fuel directly within a flowing stream of water, thereby enhancing the heat transfer coefficients by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional indirect heat transfer systems involving metallic heat transfer surfaces (such as shell-and-tube heat exchangers) separating the heated and heating media. This project proposes this combustion system to burn natural gas currently wasted through flares in remote oil fields, resolving a major environmental problem facing the industry. The second innovation utilizes the heat generated by combustion of flare-gas in the novel burner to treat oil-field produced water, another long-standing environmental concern. The third innovation uses the flue gas generated by combustion (of flare-gas) for injection into oil fields to produce trapped oil. The project will demonstrate: (1) Successful adoption (through application of combustion, heat transfer and two-phase flow principles) of the combustor design from steam generator to flue gas generator; (2) The combustor?s ability to burn flare-gas of varying hydrocarbon contents and compositions; (3) The ability to treat oil-field produced water; (4) Field-scale viability; and (5) Mathematical models and computer simulations for implementation and process scale-up.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a critical area of investigation because signal-dependent coordination of cell behavior is essential for the growth of all life forms. Signaling also plays a crucial role in dividing stem cells, ensuring that the proper number of stem cells are available to participate in tissue renewal and repair. Additionally, errors in signaling are the primary cause of cancer. Because cancer also entails unregulated cell division, it is particularly important to understand how division may exacerbate signaling errors. To explore this fundamentally important question, this collaborative research project encompasses three institutions, Princeton University, Swarthmore College and Colby College. The combined expertise will enable comprehensive investigations of signaling in dividing cells using an array of organisms, along with cutting edge genetic manipulation and imaging technologies. Additionally, this collaboration will pursue an ambitious outreach program which will include ? 1) providing enriching research experiences for a diverse group of undergraduates, 2) development of a class focused on cancer biology for elementary school students in an underserved school district as part of the established Science for Kids summer program at Swarthmore College, 3) integration between Summer Scholars Programs at Colby, Princeton and Swarthmore which focus on preparing URM and other diverse students for a successful college transition and 4) teacher-training opportunities at the Colby Center for Teaching and Learning for Princeton post-docs who will be teaching courses in the Colby January Term program. <br/><br/>Cellular trafficking of receptors and associated membrane proteins can profoundly impact cell signaling. Due to the long-held assumption that membrane trafficking is shut down during mitosis, current research has not addressed fundamental questions regarding the nature and regulation of trafficking in dividing cells. In particular, the contributions of mitotic kinases to endocytic trafficking remain poorly characterized. Additionally, the roles of specific endocytic pathways have not been delineated. This project aims to fill these critical gaps through a collaborative effort incorporating two experimental systems in which prior research has demonstrated an essential role for mitotic trafficking: polarization of mammalian epidermal cells and induction of heart progenitor cells in the basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis. It will investigate two hypotheses; 1) Cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) suppresses lysosomal degradation in a cargo-specific manner. 2) CDK1 and Aurora Kinase (AurK) suppress recycling broadly during mitosis. These hypotheses will be examined with well-established methods that disrupt specific mitotic kinases and endocytic pathways and employ high-resolution live-imaging assays to visualize the impact on receptor trafficking in both model systems. By conducting these studies on a range of cargo proteins in two highly divergent cell types, these findings will provide insights into the impact of mitotic trafficking on ? 1) fate decisions in developing embryos 2) re-establishment of polarity in dividing epithelial sheets and 3) signal dependent behaviors of stem cells or differentiated lineages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work will identify the potential of enzyme activities as biomarkers of GM1 disease progression in cellular and animal models. The polymersomes will provide real-time fluorescent read outs in the brains of mice, which correlate with these enzyme activity levels and confirm disease progression.

Towards this goal, this CAREER project aims to create a nanoparticle system of stimuli-responsive polymers (polymersomes) that alter their structure in response to pathological changes associated with brain disease to improve diagnosis. Specifically, this proposal focuses on elucidating homeostatic changes related to GM1 gangliosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder in drastic need of a diagnostic and monitoring tool. Diagnosis and monitoring can be improved by understanding the relationship between cellular changes and enzyme activity throughout disease progression, validating enzyme activity as a biomarker of disease. Simultaneously, we develop a biohybrid polymersome system, responding and degrading in the presence of enzymes, to provide a diagnostic measure. Unlike current techniques, executed at single time points only, this novel biohybrid system will enable the acquisition of temporospatial information in situ in the brain. Finally, the modular nature of this tool will permit small changes to create diagnostic opportunities throughout the brain, laying a foundation for measuring in situ levels of many macromolecules in patient brains.

For example, cyberbullying has been connected to negative mental health outcomes for adolescents. Addressing cyberbullying and cybersecurity issues in these spaces is therefore essential for healthy social development. While cyberbullying is of concern for all adolescents, adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are especially vulnerable and are at a higher risk of becoming victims of bullying and theft of personal data. This research addresses these issues by creating and employing personalized virtual companions, whose interactions with the adolescent are guided by artificial intelligence (AI). The personalized virtual companion will guide adolescents with ASD to improve their self-protection strategies and increase their cybertechnology knowledge. The goal of the project is to help prepare these individuals to become productive and satisfied members of a modern, inclusive, and technology-savvy workforce.<br/><br/>This project will address the problem of cyberbullying and cybersecurity for adolescents with ASD by developing tools based on deep learning algorithms that employ multimodal data, e.g., facial expression, body posture, breathing rate, skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, eye gaze, verbalization, and vocalization. Fusing data from these diverse sources is expected to enable creation of a virtual learning environment that is inhabited by autonomous agents, some of which have bullying or privacy-invading tendencies, and one of which is a personalized companion that seeks to help its human friend navigate the Internet. The AI companion must adapt its interactions based on understanding the external (verbal and nonverbal) behaviors and internal stress indicators (e.g., neurosensory) of its human counterpart. Development of an AI companion is especially challenging when working with members of a vulnerable population whose facial expressions and vocalizations do not always match those of neurotypical adolescents. A current issue with this type of research is that training datasets are populated by neurotypical subjects and thus are potentially not representative of the population this project is intended to serve, adolescents with ASD.  The desired outcomes from the project are novel deep learning algorithms to address the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art multimodal Facial Expression Recognition algorithms currently designed for neurotypical adolescents.  The project may also aid self-regulation of ASD adolescents when faced with cyberbullying and attempts to invade privacy as well as other social situations.  It should also lead to an understanding of how this AI intervention strengthens the individual?s knowledge of technology and their affinity for cybersecurity careers.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

Imbalances in this budget are difficult to detect due to the large amounts of energy that come and go at any given time. Ocean temperature is the most reliable indicator of changes in the planet?s energy budget because Earth primarily stores excess energy in the ocean. Furthermore, increases in stored energy cause ocean temperature to rise. The rate that the ocean stores more heat is the ocean heat uptake, a key measure of climate variability. Ocean heat uptake is accelerating over the last few decades, but it is unknown whether there is any precedent in Earth?s past. This study will reconstruct ocean heat uptake for the last twenty thousand years in order to put ongoing changes into context. The last twenty thousand years included enormous changes in climate, including the disintegration of large ice sheets that extended southward into much of the current United States. This time period also had large warming events with ocean heat uptake that could have rivaled the present day. The reconstruction of ocean heat uptake may benefit society by improving our understanding of how climate responds to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. In addition, this project will quantify the potential for the deep ocean and ice sheets to affect the climate of the 21st century. The project includes plans to train the next generation of ocean scientists through support for a postdoctoral researcher and integration of methods into a MIT/WHOI Joint Program graduate<br/>course. All research products will be publicly and freely accessible through archives at the National Centers for Environmental Information and GitHub.<br/><br/>This project aims to reconstruct global ocean heat uptake for the last 20,000 years by assimilating paleoceanographic temperature data into an ocean circulation model that describes decadal, centennial, and millennial timescales of climate variability. The key methodological question is, how well can paleo-temperature observations be inverted for ocean heat uptake? The method will utilize known climate power laws that dictate that low-frequency temperature variations contain more energy than high frequencies. These power laws permit the infilling of gaps in paleo-data and a statistically-rigorous uncertainty analysis. Improved reconstructions of ocean heat uptake will address the hidden systematic errors due to the time-evolving composition of the observing system, the sparsity of observations before 1955, and the expected variability of the deep ocean. The resulting ocean heat uptake evolution connects through periods with both proxy and instrumental data, including the last deglaciation, the mid-Holocene climate optimum, the Medieval Climate Anomaly, the Little Ice Age, and the industrial era, which facilitates comparison between past and present ocean conditions. Examination of ocean heat uptake since the Last Glacial Maximum (20,000 years ago) will allow a wide perspective on warming rates, and new observational evidence suggests that deglacial ocean heat uptake rivaled the present day during some time intervals. This project benefits the broader science community by producing dynamically-informed reconstructions of ocean heat uptake for the last 20,000 years, including uncertainty estimates. Ocean heat uptake is a required quantity to diagnose equilibrium and transient climate sensitivity, two key climate metrics for predicting surface temperature. Quantification of uncertainties is a necessary step toward more accurate risk assessments of future climate scenarios and has relevance to policy decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The process of DNA repair is essential to ensure that the genetic information in the DNA genome remains intact. Inside cells, DNA is continually under assault from multiple sources, including its watery environment, chemicals produced by metabolism, or exposure to external radiation or toxins. To protect the DNA, cells have evolved biochemical processes that patrol the genome, detect damage, and organize responses aimed at restoring the integrity of the DNA. This project focuses on one such repair process, called nucleotide excision repair, in which damaged segments of DNA are removed and replaced with normal DNA. This work will be carried out in bacteria, but because DNA repair mechanisms are similar in higher organisms, including humans, the results should have wide-ranging scientific impact. The project also will have educational impact through programs for engaging undergraduates in research and creative arts and for outreach to public schools in New York City. These educational activities will help fulfill two broad missions:  for scientists to attract and retain students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, and for the City College of New York to provide a high-quality and affordable education to children of New York City, immigrants, minorities, and those without economic means. <br/><br/>DNA repair is a fundamental process dedicated to maintenance of genetic information, yet many mechanistic details of DNA repair remain obscure. This research will fill gaps in our understanding of one DNA repair pathway, bacterial nucleotide excision repair. Previous research established roles for three proteins, UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC, which function via a series of large and dynamic multi-protein complexes. By applying biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches, experiments will test structure-based models for three mechanisms:  1) identification of damaged DNA from a background of native DNA, 2) nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, and 3) the molecular choreography of UvrA and UvrB on lesion-containing DNA. The results are expected to provide new insights into how nucleotide excision repair occurs in the context of genome surveillance and repair. Moreover, this knowledge will influence our views of other cellular activities, including DNA replication, gene expression, evolutionary processes and the cellular processes of apoptosis, senescence, and tumorigenesis.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and the Molecular Biophysics programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They also impact plant defenses and build soil quality. The functioning of AM fungi varies tremendously between species and isolates. As a result, studies of AM fungi can improve management of agriculture, grasslands and forests. Progress in understanding the importance and optimal management of AM fungi depends upon tests of AM fungi cultures. Unfortunately, few researchers have the expertise or facilities necessary to develop or maintain their own AM fungal cultures, and therefore the availability of cultures can limit scientific progress. This project will enable the study of this important group of soil fungi through support of a culture collection called the International culture collection of (Vesicular) Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM).  This is the largest culture collection of this type of fungi in the world and includes hundreds of individual isolates.  This collection will enable advancement of knowledge on AM fungal biology, genetics, ecology, and taxonomy, as well as applications of AM fungi for commercial purposes. This project will also promote the exploration of science by the private sector and by students of all ages and abilities. The project will develop modules on experimentation using INVAM cultures that support the K-12 Next Generation Life Science Standards. Standards related to plant growth, soil health and the importance of biodiversity can all be supported by the collection.<br/><br/>INVAM has been the largest provider of cultures to the scientific community and has been the primary resource for identification of AM fungal species. INVAM maintains the largest number of reference cultures, cultures that are linked to a library of voucher specimens and to species descriptions. These reference cultures are a critical resource for the development and testing of new approaches to environmental sequencing, a potentially powerful method to study patterns of AM fungi in the field. The project will maximize the value of the reference cultures through sequencing efforts. The core mission of INVAM is to preserve accessions and provide living cultures to the user community. INVAM also provides comprehensive information on collection protocols and policies, methodology, taxonomy, and a searchable database for accessions and active/stored cultures via the INVAM website. Users include teachers and students from high schools through graduate programs at universities, researchers, and industry clients. Stocks include representatives of 95 AM fungal species, and high value germ plasm including strains used for genome projects and strains known to be highly effective as mycorrhizal symbionts. Dr. Joseph Morton, who built and curated INVAM since 1990, retired in 2017. This project secures the future of the INVAM collections by moving it to the University of Kansas.  The move occurs in phases through the duration of the project to ensure culture viability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen is an extremely important chemical feedstock that is used a wide variety of chemical processes. However, by itself it does not react or reacts very slowly. To circumvent this problem a number of metal compounds have been developed that activate hydrogen and greatly speed its rate of reactions. These compounds are called catalysts and almost all are based on expensive, rare metals. This project studies the ability of a less expensive metal, cobalt, to activate hydrogen. As the details of how hydrogen adds to various compounds is difficult to determine, an unusual form of hydrogen known as parahydrogen will be used in this study to increase the sensitivity of measurements up to 200,000 times. In addition, the project aims to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in the next generation of scientists. Prof. Fout and her students will participate in the 3M Summer Scholars Program, which aims to provide research experiences to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, the Next Generation Illinois Scientist, which engages elementary students in rural schools, and the Bonding Camp for Girls, which targets 6-8th grade girls.<br/><br/>This project synthesizes cobalt complexes that may serve as parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) catalysts. This requires diamagnetic complexes that remain S=0 throughout the catalytic cycle for both direct and indirect hyperpolarization. To achieve this and to access a Co(I)/Co(III) catalytic cycle, complexes of ligands containing electron-rich moieties and carbenes are prepared. Their activity to catalyze PHIP is evaluated across a range of substrates including olefins, alkynes, and arenes, which feature long-relaxing nuclei in their functional groups. Some of the substrates are key reactants in polymerization catalysis. In these cases, the PHIP effect is used to detect and study of mechanistic intermediates that have not previously been observed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these processes are complex and yet to be fully understood. For example, primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the embryonic precursors that ultimately develop into eggs and sperm to ensure the continuation of life. Disruption of PGC formation will cause infertility. It remains elusive how PGCs diverge from other cell types during development and establish germ cell competency. Based on a recently developed platform that enables robust PGC generation and advanced genome-wide gene-editing technologies, this project aims to unveil novel regulators and fundamental mechanisms (or ?rules?) that govern germ cell commitment. Research findings will critically improve understanding of the causes of human infertility, which affects about 15% of couples worldwide. Results from this project will further benefit the agricultural community by critically informing novel strategies to improve the reproductive health of livestock animals. The research team will maximize the broader impact of this project by combining scientific research with educational and public outreach activities. They will incorporate scientific advances into educational programs to foster next-generation STEM scientists, and work closely with outreach partners to engage K-12 students. They will promote diversity, equality, and inclusion by encouraging underrepresented groups and women to get involved in sciences. <br/><br/>To date, only a few regulators (e.g., WNT and BMPs) have been identified to play crucial roles in PGC specification during mammalian embryonic development. The broader gene-regulatory network that controls PGC ontogeny remains poorly defined ? feasibility largely limited by the low numbers of nascent PGCs during development and inefficient approaches to identify and functionally evaluate candidate regulators at large scales. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have the great potential to proliferate unlimitedly in vitro and to differentiate into all lineages of cells in the body, including germ cells. In pilot studies, the research team used a robust in vitro differentiation platform of mouse PSCs with germline reporters to generate a large quantity of PGCs, and subsequently identified 589 putative germ cell regulators from a genome-wide CRISPR-based activation screening. Building on these promising data, this project aims to reveal the novel molecular determinants and functional mechanisms by which PSCs establish germline competency. Objective 1 will discover novel regulators of PGC specification at a genome-wide scale, with a custom-made small guide RNA (sgRNA) library and a stepwise validation strategy. Candidate regulators will then be prioritized for individual validation according to their sgRNA enrichment frequency, expression levels in PGCs, and ontology. Objective 2 will unveil the molecular mechanisms by which a newly discovered candidate from the pilot study regulates PGC specification via both WNT-dependent and independent pathways. In summary, this project will unveil a broader regulatory network that governs PGC ontogeny, a major advance in understanding the molecular determinants that control lineage specification during development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The use of the term ""historically underrepresented minority"" reflects language from Congress, and in the context of the AGEP program, the AGEP populations are defined as STEM doctoral candidates, postdoctoral scholars and faculty, who are African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The AGEP program seeks to advance knowledge about models to improve pathways to the professoriate and the successes of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty, who are members of racial and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in STEM.  AGEP awardees develop, implement, study, evaluate and disseminate AGEP Alliance Models to transform the dissertation phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement, and the transitions within and across the pathway levels.<br/><br/>As the nation addresses STEM achievement gaps in postsecondary education, our universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote STEM faculty who are members of AGEP populations and who serve as role models and academic leaders for students to learn from, work with and emulate. Recent NSF reports indicate that STEM associate and full professors, who are members of racial and ethnic groups, occupy 8% of senior faculty positions at all 4-year colleges and universities, and about 6% of faculty positions at the nation's most research-intensive institutions. This AGEP National Research Conference will advance knowledge about initiatives that can be institutionalized, sustained, and strengthened to increase the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty in STEM.<br/><br/>This conference convening will bring together hundreds of AGEP and non-AGEP awardees to advance knowledge and broader impacts about academic STEM career pathways. The goals of the conference are: 1) To provide a venue for AGEP Alliances to gain knowledge and share best practices on methods to strengthen, institutionalize, expand, and sustain their Alliances and communicate project findings; 2) To provide a venue for AGEP Alliance teams to share best practices and methods about interacting with and supporting their project participants; and 3) To provide NSF with a platform to garner stakeholder input from the AGEP awardees and to share new funding opportunities, policy changes and program updates with the awardees.  <br/><br/>The two and half-day conference is scheduled for November of 2022, in Corpus Christi, TX. In addition to plenary and keynote sessions, research presentations and a poster session, there will be round-table and small group discussions, and other interactive sessions to increase conference engagement.  The proposed work includes evaluation components and a dissemination plan to publish peer-reviewed conference proceedings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project will study how to design the best public transport network in congested large urban areas.  It leverages high-resolution data and several modern economic methods to determine the best network structures and discusses how the best network shape depends on city structure and commuter preferences.  In developing recommendations for the best network design and studying its rollout, this project will also provide valuable insights for efficient bus systems during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. More broadly, it will provide insights into the design features of public bus systems in congested large urban areas in the developed world as well as in emerging market mega-cities, to the benefit of millions of daily public transport riders worldwide.  The results of this research project will provide inputs into urban transportation designs that improves urban transportation, decrease communing cost, hence improve worker productivity, leading to faster economic growth.  It will also improve the wellbeing of commuters as well as contribute to slowing the pace of climate change.   <br/><br/>This two-part project develops a model of an optimal urban bus transit system and estimate the model with a large, innovative data collected by the PIs for the project.  The first part develops and estimates a travel demand model of public transport in a large densely populated and congested urban area.  The project will use high-resolution micro data on ridership and commuting, variation induced by large historical route network expansion, and a system-wide randomized experiment that the PIs have conducted, to estimate the degree to which commuters value key parameters such as fast connections, direct connections, and frequent service.   The second part will use numerical optimization techniques to compute the optimal public transport network and to synthesize how the optimal network shape depends on factors such as the commuter preference parameters, city structure, and the policy objective.  The project connects and expands upon classic topics in the transportation economics literature, such as travel demand estimation and increasing returns in public transport, by employing rigorous causal estimation and studying actual empirical variation in an entire citywide network of routes. The quantitative methods and qualitative insights from this study have the potential to inform public transport network design in densely populated urban areas in developed as well as developing countries around the world.  The results of this research project will provide inputs into designs that will improve urban transportation, decrease communing cost, hence improve worker productivity, leading to faster economic growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although most human designs of propulsors such as wings or propellers are rigid, natural propulsors are generally flexible. Propulsive efficiencies of natural flyers and swimmers are typically higher than human-designed vehicles of similar weight and dimensions. However, attempts to emulate flexible animal designs have met with limited success. Recent comparative animal studies have demonstrated startlingly consistent patterns of bending kinematics among a broad diversity of swimmers and flyers constructed from very different materials and of very different physical dimensions. These patterns encompass cilia to whale flukes and fluid regimes from water to air. This project will use computational fluid dynamics and particle image velocimetry to measure fluid velocities to investigate the mechanical and fluid dynamic details that enable high force production by flexible natural propulsors.  K-12 outreach activities are planned at the universities and at the Cabrillo Aquarium in San Pedro, CA and undergraduate and graduate student involvement is core to the research project. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a set of design rules that govern force production by flexible propulsors. To achieve this goal, experiments and computations will be used to investigate: a) bending kinematics of propulsors as control surfaces of vorticity, pressure fields and thrust, b) the hydrodynamic basis of vortex-vortex interactions that generate pressure fields and thrust and c) the advantageous limits of bending kinematics. Each of these will be investigated using a combination of experiments (particle image velocimetry) with natural organisms and computational fluid dynamic models. The results of this project will define the necessary design criteria that enable performance enhancement by bending propulsors of different types and across a range of fluid regimes. While contributing to interpretation of the natural world, the results will also contribute to novel engineered designs ranging from biomedical applications (cilia) to vehicle design (swimming, flight).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The high temperatures combined with extreme flow events, such as shock waves and turbulence, reduce the life of propulsion devices, such as gas turbine engines, high performance aircraft aero-engines, scramjets, rockets, lift-off and reentry vehicles, among others. The project will address complex thermal transport processes during the interactions of shock wave and turbulence with the goal of enabling safer and more reliable aero-propulsion engines. Fundamental understanding will be promoted, along with training, teaching, and learning by means of parallel education/outreach components, such as incorporation of findings in graduate education, and presentations in symposia and conferences. Women, minority students, and undergraduate students will also participate, as well as both teachers and students from local high schools. <br/><br/>This project seeks to improve the understanding of thermal turbulence transport by considering: (a) effects of shock wave mode, angle, orientation, and strength, and the sources and modes of shock wave unsteadiness which alter thermal transport and surface heat transfer, (b) the means whereby shock wave unsteadiness alters and propagates into subsonic boundary layer regions to affect near-wall thermal transport mechanisms and surface heat transfer, (c) effects of the strength and relative size of shock wave induced separation on thermal transport, (d) effects of shock wave compression heating, viscous friction heating, and conversion of kinetic energy to internal energy on thermal transport, and (e) resulting alterations to turbulence and scalar fluxes, second order turbulent quantities, and coherence and time lag distributions. Unsteady motions of different types of shock waves and unsteady, spatially-varying surface heat transfer and thermal transport will be considered through a coordinated experimental-computational study. A newly developed supersonic wind tunnel system will be employed, along with large eddy simulations, to provide detailed flow and thermal field characteristics. Crucial causal relationships will be clarified through understanding of: (i) associated thermal transport characteristics, (ii) spatially-dependent and frequency-dependent coherence and time lag between events at different flow conditions, (iii) highly-resolved experimental visualizations of unsteady flow features from which quantitative flow information will be determined, and (iv) spatio-temporal flow and thermal field-data from numerical predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compounds that are currently used by the industry have large global warming potential and/or ozone depletion potential. Environmentally friendlier alternatives that have been identified are hydrofluorocarbons, which are flammable and pose fire risks. Some of these hydrofluorocarbons are already in use as refrigerants even though their combustion behavior is not well-characterized. Candidate fire suppressants that were tested were found to promote combustion instead of inhibiting it. This project aims to quantify the reactivity of hydrofluorocarbons through novel experiments. Furthermore, computations will be performed to investigate the fire risk associated with these compounds in the case of accidental leakage and subsequent ignition. The results from these studies are expected to play an important role in the selection and adoption of hydrofluorocarbons in the industry and the development of safety protocol. The project will not only advance the understanding of the combustion behavior of these exotic compounds but also of other fundamental combustion aspects such as gravity-induced acceleration of flames. The proposed project will also create opportunities for undergraduate students to have hands-on, experimental research experience and will result in the development of education modules, which will be used to strengthen courses as well as inspire K-12 students.<br/><br/>Hydrofluorocarbons are mildly flammable compared to hydrocarbons, which makes quantifying their reactivity challenging. Flame speeds will be measured by overcoming challenges associated with buoyancy-induced flow and radiation heat loss, using a lab-scale drop tower experiment and detailed computational models, respectively. Judiciously performed parametric studies will enable the elucidation and quantification of their reactivity, dominated by reactions of fluorine-based radicals, and create archival data valuable for the development of chemical kinetic models. Due to their mild reactivity, gravity-driven instability growth is expected to significantly influence the dynamics of hydrofluorocarbon/air flames. Direct Numerical Simulations will be performed to investigate the effect of instability growth on flame dynamics, the coupling between the gravity-driven and intrinsic flame front instabilities resulting from thermal expansion and non-equidiffusion, and the resulting flame acceleration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wustholz of the Department of Chemistry at College of William and Mary will examine how light is emitted from molecules in order to enhance the ability to visualize structures at the nanoscale. When molecules are continuously illuminated, they respond by emitting random bursts of light, a phenomenon called blinking.  This blinking behavior can be harnessed for many applications such as imaging biological structures and nanomaterials down to 10-nm length scales ? a feat that is not possible with conventional optical microscopy.  However, lack of understanding and control over the variations in blinking behavior from molecule to molecule across a sample fundamentally limit the image quality that can be achieved.  The focus of this project is to examine and engineer blinking to produce high-quality and super-resolution images of materials that are relevant to medicine and technology. At the same time, this project provides training for undergraduate and master?s research students who learn physical, analytical, and computational techniques as well as build communication skills. Dr. Wustholz will continue her commitment to diversity and inclusion through mentoring with the Chemistry Women Mentorship Network and her use of teaching practices that benefit all students, but especially those who are low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented. This project also involves a new collaborative exchange with Temple University to further enhance scientific training and professional development of students at both institutions.<br/><br/>The design and development of improved single-molecule probes is currently limited by several factors including: 1) unwanted heterogeneity in blinking dynamics due to contributions from multiple dark states, 2) uncontrolled environment-induced changes to blinking, and 3) reliance on spectrally-distinct dyes for multicolor imaging. The first aim of this project is to untangle the role of different dark states and their dependence on molecular structure so that blinking heterogeneity can be minimized when it is detrimental and exploited when it is useful. The initial target is a series of well-characterized xanthenes as a model system to unravel and control heterogeneity using a dark-state competition strategy. Next, the influence of molecular structure and environmental conditions will be used to control the different dark states and blinking heterogeneity of BODIPYs, promising probes whose blinking mechanisms are currently not well understood. These investigations will inform molecular design strategies for tailored emission dynamics as well as unlock new opportunities in probe design through the development of a new approach to multicolor super-resolved imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas linked to climate change and environmental concerns. Solutions to sequester carbon dioxide underground and in deep oceans are expensive, and the long-term effectiveness, safety, and associated environmental impacts are unclear. This project allows highly efficient conversion of carbon dioxide into valuable green products using only renewable solar energy. The cost-effective, sustainable production of green fuels utilizing carbon dioxide as a feedstock will be key to reducing emissions and lowering dependency on fossil-based sources. Low-cost green fuels, such as methane, are expected to accelerate the penetration of a $30 billion market for the transportation and power generation sectors.<br/><br/>This project addresses the fact that the high stability of carbon dioxide and conventional approaches to convert these molecules  involve high temperature, high pressure, and/or extremely reactive reagents, rendering them expensive and harmful to the environment. Artificial photosynthesis is a promising approach to convert carbon dioxide and water into commercially valuable chemical products, such as methane, methanol, formic acid and syngas, using only solar energy. This project will assess the technical feasibility of a revolutionary artificial photosynthesis system based on photocatalyst wafers prepared using magnetron sputter epitaxy (MSE) to generate green methane from carbon dioxide in a single step. The proposed project utilizes low-cost, scalable processes to prepare photocatalyst wafers with high efficiencies and stabilities that can be extrapolated to 20+ years of operation lifetime. The key challenge is to effectively combine the novel carbon dioxide reduction functionality with the unique light harvesting and water oxidation platform, and optimize the operating parameters to enhance the overall system efficiency and robustness. The goal is to demonstrate photocatalyst wafers with 10+% solar to fuel efficiencies, unprecedented long-term stability in the carbon dioxide reduction process, and a bench-scale prototype for performance validation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With this increased degree of data generation comes another important issue - the missing data problem. This missing data problem could be due to data that is either unobserved (e.g., due to the sampling method), observed incorrectly (e.g., due to errors in method of observation), or can?t be observed (e.g., due to extinction). Missing data are often not accounted for and can cause incorrect conclusions in population genomics research. This project will build bioinformatics software to address these three missing data problems. The statistical framework and methods developed by this project will be utilized extensively by evolutionary biologists in a variety of fields. Additionally, this project will develop accessible software pipelines and curricular material for recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups into computer programming and bioinformatics at a variety of levels (K-12, Undergraduate, Graduate, post-graduate).<br/><br/>Population genomic data are either considered to be missing due to (1) sequencing or genotyping errors, (2) systematic bias in the generation of genotyping libraries (e.g. from techniques such as restriction associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), or (3) the absence of genomic data from un-sampled, perhaps extinct ?ghost? populations. This project will develop a series of tools to address all three missing data problems by accounting for missing data as an unobserved variable in statistical models for the estimation of population genetic parameters and evolutionary history from genomic data. Specifically, we will (1) build a parallelized statistical framework for estimating population genetic structure from multi-allelic, multi-locus genomic data that incorporates missing data into a maximum likelihood framework, (2) systematically explore RADseq data sets ? using extensive simulations and a meta-analysis of published studies to both quantify and account for how missing data due to ?lost? polymorphisms at restriction sites biases estimation of evolutionary history, and (3) develop a statistical model to classify genomic loci as those having introgressed from extant or from ?ghost? populations based on their coalescent histories under the Isolation with Migration (IM) model. This work will form the basis of a set of robust tools that will be utilized by evolutionary biologists in a variety of fields to systematically both assess and account for the effects of missing data in their population genomic data sets. This CAREER grant will also strengthen University-public partnerships through (1) week-long summer bioinformatics workshops for high-school biology teachers in the Philadelphia and San Diego areas, (2) development of curricular material for The Galaxy Project, the Conservation Genomics Workshop at the University of Montana, and the California State University Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB), (3) recruitment and retention of underrepresented student scholars into genomics research. All curricular material, software, and pipelines developed will be shared via the PI?s GitHub page: www.github.com/arunsethuraman.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is common for situations to occur in which there is little light or objects are hidden, such as nighttime in outdoor or indoor environments when the power outage happens, water press of plants, and hollows in the bridge deck. Thermal images capture the long-wave infrared signals to generate images and have broad applications in transportation, agriculture, and surveillance. This project develops 3D modeling and understanding methods based on thermal images. The developed 3D modeling technology can enable autonomous driving vehicles to detect the scene depth from thermal images to avoid traffic accidents. With a 3D thermal model, hidden gas pipes in buildings and cracks in bridges can also be inspected more reliably.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project addresses the 3D thermal sensing and understanding issues through the following thrusts: (1) thermal image feature detection and extraction, (2) translation between thermal and visible images, (3) unsupervised 3D thermal reconstruction methods based on both image sequence and a single image, and (4) 3D thermal model understanding, particularly for nighttime and invisible objects. The algorithms developed in this project will enable 3D reconstruction and understanding tasks for invisible scenes. The output from this project will allow related services provided for visible objects and during the daytime to be also available for invisible objects and during nighttime, such as hidden object inspection and navigation in the nighttime. The enhancement of invisible scene processing capability will improve safety and cybersecurity across different scenarios, from daytime to nighttime and from exposed objects to invisible object properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed system will be integrated in a single framework, resulting in a compact (handheld) and real-time imager at a low manufacturing cost. This will make the proposed technology comparable in cost to dermoscopic imaging, facilitating its widespread use and application. The proposed device will also be able to identify tumor margins in the millimeter-wave images of skin lesions.

This will be realized by employing the synthetic ultra-wideband imaging approach, where several disjointed, adjacent imaging sub-bands are integrated to collectively form an ultra-wide imaging bandwidth. Each sub-band contains a transmitting and a receiving element that operate only within that specific sub-band. In this research, the RF front-ends of sub-band phased-array antennas will be developed and integrated with the transceiver components of the imaging system on a single chip. The developed phased arrays will be configured to radiate and collect RF frequencies over different frequency sub-bands, while forming independent beams with separate phase-shifting operations. Therefore, electronic beam-steering can be used for scanning the target region. In addition, a novel method for tumor margin identification in 3-D millimeter-wave images is proposed in which a-priori information about the statistical distribution of the dielectric properties of tissues is employed.

As the transition to electric vehicles takes hold, potential markets for ultra-fast battery chargers for these electric vehicles will be sizeable.  Estimates for the commercial market for electric vehicle charging stations is projected to reach $27.7 billion by 2027 from an estimated $2.5 billion in 2019.  This project addresses the persistent problem of long electric vehicle recharging times and associated ?range anxiety? among consumers.

Because the power levels required for ultra-fast EV charging are necessarily high, the project will focus on innovative measures to ensure public safety and system reliability while obtaining high electrical efficiencies.  A relatively low power model will be constructed in Phase I for later scale-up. Solving technical challenges associated with an ultra-fast high-power electric vehicle charger has potential to advance knowledge of electromagnetics, power electronics, automated control, and materials science associated with ultra-fast electric vehicle recharging.

In a rapidly changing situation, like that of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, unforeseeable changes in behavior, control measures, pharmaceutical interventions like vaccination, and changes in the virus itself make it challenging to provide accurate disease forecasts more than 3-4 weeks into the future. Many policy decisions require multiple months of advanced planning, however. Scenario projection models provide an essential framework for assessing what might happen during an outbreak in the longer-term, such as 3-6 months, under scenarios with well-defined assumptions about things like control measures, vaccination, and variant spread in the future. Because of real uncertainty in how an epidemic situation may unfold, combining scenario projections from multiple models with different assumptions about the future can provide a more complete picture of  the epidemic possibilities. The useful production and interpretation of multiple scenario projections rests critically with the careful definition of questions, the explicit specification of scenarios, and the concise communication of these assumptions and findings, tasks that are not always accomplished in the use of epidemiological modeling for policy. This project will provide training opportunities for a graduate student. Through collaboration with the U.S. CDC and other public health agencies, the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub project is well poised to shape the research and implementation capacity of forthcoming U.S.-wide epidemic and disease prediction initiatives.<br/><br/>This project supports the coordination of the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH), an effort that aims to provide decision makers with a form of ?situational awareness? under multiple plausible futures by serving as a central, harmonized source of timely scenario modeling projections. The SMH aims to propel the science of scenario projection modeling, thus leading the way for future, long-term coordinated multi-modeling exercises. These efforts are focused on (1) defining tractable policy questions, (2) designing standardized scenarios for multiple modeling groups to answer those questions, with specific focus on limiting uncertainty in scenario-related components, while allowing for different model assumptions and implementations in other aspects; and (3) communicating and interpreting model results to help guide policy and highlight legitimate sources of scientific disagreement. Additionally, this project also supports ongoing adjustment and improvement of the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Scenario Pipeline model, which both contributes to the SMH and provides the SMH coordination team with a useful tool for experimenting with scenario specifications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its promise, the use of cloud computing in automotive vehicle control and sensing still has limited success due to concerns in communication privacy and real-time constraints inherent to many automotive systems. This award supports fundamental research that addresses the major challenges in cloud-based control, collaborative sensing, decentralized optimization, and privacy preservation. The new designs and methodologies will offer a transformative framework in cloud-facilitated collaborative sensing and control that seamlessly integrate cloud and vehicle resources to enable smarter, safer, and greener next-generation automotive systems. This research is synergistic with key societal goals related to developing efficient, secure, and safe transportation systems. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and life quality. This research involves several disciplines including control theory, machine learning, vehicle dynamics, and privacy preservation. The multi-disciplinary approach also facilitates the participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impacts engineering education.<br/><br/>The cloud-facilitated collaborative sensing and control is expected to greatly enhance vehicle control performance, and achieve improved safety, energy efficiency, and ride comfort. In pursuit of this goal, four closely integrated research objectives are planned: 1) Develop a novel privacy-preserving, learning-based collaborative sensing framework to enable the exploitation of multiple heterogeneous vehicles to iteratively improve the estimation of important road information (e.g., black ice and pothole) while preserving privacy; 2) Formalize and synthesize privacy-aware cloud-facilitated control to seamlessly integrate cloud and onboard controls for enhanced performance without leaking vehicle privacy; 3) Develop a computationally-efficient, privacy-preserving decentralized control framework by explicitly exploiting the sparse communication/constraint topologies in connected vehicles, and 4) Evaluate and validate the frameworks through extensive simulations and experiments.

By considering projections of these outcomes under different assumptions about the upcoming course of the pandemic, researchers will help inform decisions by providing timely information to government officials and the public to inform response efforts in the United States. The need to consider multiple potential scenarios and involve input from multiple modeling teams is particularly important when the conditions under which the pandemic will continue are uncertain. This includes effects on pathogen transmissibility and disease severity that may accompany novel variants.

These gases are repeatedly measured every year throughout the global ocean by many laboratories and it is important that the measurements are consistent and directly comparable to one another. A valuable component to establishing commonality and communication between independent laboratories is the use of consensus material, which is the focus of this project. The production and distribution of consensus material represents part of a broader and ongoing program of activity ? including workshops, intercomparison exercises, and the production of standards ? which is all designed to assess performance and improve the accuracy of dissolved methane and nitrous oxide measurements. This research project will benefit the international research community that is actively involved in measurements of dissolved methane and nitrous oxide. Dissemination of the results from independent analysis of the consensus material will be via publication in the scientific literature. The production of the consensus material will be filmed and made into a concise movie clip that will accompany a previous video produced by the lead investigator on the importance of non-CO2 greenhouse gases in the ocean. <br/><br/>Together, methane and nitrous oxide comprise almost a quarter of the total radiative forcing budget attributed to greenhouse gases and their current tropospheric mole fractions and rates of increase are unprecedented in recent Earth history. Furthermore, both methane and nitrous oxide have a higher warming potential than carbon dioxide. Despite their critical importance, measurements of methane and nitrous oxide in the global oceans are much less coordinated than carbon dioxide. The scientific community is taking steps to improve this situation and has an overall goal to collectively achieve an accuracy and precision of less than 1% for methane and nitrous oxide measurements. The production and distribution of consensus material through this project is a critical step towards achieving this goal as it will facilitate the evaluation of existing measurements conducted by independent laboratories. In particular, the consensus material will be used to evaluate progress that is anticipated to have resulted from a set of intercomparison exercises that were conducted during 2014-2017 and ongoing contributions to a Best Practice Guide for dissolved methane and nitrous oxide measurements. Using a two hundred liter reservoir, consensus material will be prepared using seawater collected near the University of Hawaii for a range of dissolved methane and nitrous oxide concentrations.

Its goal is to introduce undergraduate students to key elements of research on land and water resources essential to improving management practices, with a focus on Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) and diverse interdisciplinary research teams. Each year, students divided into three teams to conduct research that integrates Earth-surface dynamics, geology, hydrology and other disciplines. Research teams are hosted by two Native American communities (Confederated Salish Kootenai Tribes and Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa) and the University of Minnesota to work on projects developed in collaboration with the tribes' resource management divisions. This REU Site incorporates an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach that emphasizes quantitative and predictive methods, CBPR, indigenous research methods, and traditional ecological knowledge. The REU Site encourages participation by underrepresented students and students who are unsure about how they fit into the world of science to pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/>The REU Site is developing a new paradigm for undergraduate research that will increase participation of all students, particularly URMs in the geosciences via a transformative process that places the communities where research is being conducted and the participants themselves at the core of the program design. The REU is designed to be transformative not only to student participants, but to the institutions themselves, by increasing interaction between tribal communities, tribal colleges, and mainstream research institutions. The program design starts from the position that diversity in the geosciences can only happen when the system itself is fundamentally changed, adopting a partnership rather than a domination model. Every aspect of the REU is considered from the perspective of increasing institutional capacity for inclusive excellence. The PIs are building knowledge on increasing participation in REUs by the non-traditional student and students from groups underrepresented in STEM. The PIs are building knowledge on increasing participation in REUs by non-traditional students and students from groups underrepresented in STEM. The researchers have developed a proven, structured, scaffolded method of teaching science research and writing, which takes students who may have never written a technical research paper and provides them with the skills and support needed to routinely deliver high quality intellectual outputs and increase their intellectual self-confidence in the process. The mentoring plan for the REU Site is focused on helping mentors to: a) prepare to mentor highly diverse teams of students; b) support mentors to deal with the expectations, issues and challenges that arise when you are mentoring teams that have a large number of nontraditional students; and c) help mentors get acculturated to conducting research on tribal lands and with Native people. The students, faculty, graduate and post-doctoral mentors, tribal professionals and other community members are intimately engaged in CBPR, developing projects that inherently support tribal resource management goals. Results are disseminated to tribal authorities and community members as well as the broader scientific community. Outcomes of this REU research paradigm will concurrently establish a legacy of broader scientific capacity within reservation communities and provide pathways to scientific discoveries with a shared foundation of trust and respect.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although most human designs of propulsors such as wings or propellers are rigid, natural propulsors are generally flexible. Propulsive efficiencies of natural flyers and swimmers are typically higher than human-designed vehicles of similar weight and dimensions. However, attempts to emulate flexible animal designs have met with limited success. Recent comparative animal studies have demonstrated startlingly consistent patterns of bending kinematics among a broad diversity of swimmers and flyers constructed from very different materials and of very different physical dimensions. These patterns encompass cilia to whale flukes and fluid regimes from water to air. This project will use computational fluid dynamics and particle image velocimetry to measure fluid velocities to investigate the mechanical and fluid dynamic details that enable high force production by flexible natural propulsors.  K-12 outreach activities are planned at the universities and at the Cabrillo Aquarium in San Pedro, CA and undergraduate and graduate student involvement is core to the research project. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a set of design rules that govern force production by flexible propulsors. To achieve this goal, experiments and computations will be used to investigate: a) bending kinematics of propulsors as control surfaces of vorticity, pressure fields and thrust, b) the hydrodynamic basis of vortex-vortex interactions that generate pressure fields and thrust and c) the advantageous limits of bending kinematics. Each of these will be investigated using a combination of experiments (particle image velocimetry) with natural organisms and computational fluid dynamic models.

In most cases, this is fixed by the chemistry of the constituent atoms. However, recent advances in the ability to isolate atomically thin crystals and stack them on top of each other provide a route to engineer new synthetic materials. This project investigates how adding a small twist between adjacent layers can be used to control the positions and propagation of electrons. In particular, the rotational misalignment causes the electrons to interact especially strongly with each other, leading to new quantum electronic properties. The research uses a nanoscale sensor to image the resulting electron positions, study the new quantum states that form, and determine the degree to which they can be controlled. The predicted states may have applications in low-power electronics, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and high-density data storage. The project also trains undergraduate and graduate students for careers in quantum technology, fosters the involvement of underrepresented groups in science through summer internships, and inspires the next generation of researchers by developing and implementing outreach activities for high school students and local science festivals.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>Stacking van der Waals materials with similar lattice constants at small relative twist angle can generate exceptionally flat electronic bands that are susceptible to strong Coulomb interactions. This project aims to investigate the plethora of many-body phases that can be realized in twisted devices composed from semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The research uses a scanning single-electron transistor (SET) to measure local electronic compressibility and to image charge distribution in moiré TMD systems. The primary goals include: 1) measuring the energy gaps and excitations of correlated electronic ground states; 2) imaging charge ordered phases, such as stripes and generalized Wigner crystals and their melting; and 3) probing the dependence of these emergent states on magnetic field, doping, and twist angle to map out the triangular Hubbard model phase diagram. Moiré TMD systems provide unprecedented flexibility for quantum simulation across a wide swath of Hubbard model parameter space. As a local thermodynamic probe of electronic properties, the SET provides unique insight into this strongly correlated materials platform. In addition, graduate and undergraduate students gain experience in the area of van der Waals assembly and low-temperature scanning probe microscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our ability to maintain focus, however, fluctuates over time when we experience mind wandering, distraction, boredom, or depletion (i.e., feeling like we?re ?out of gas? when we try to sustain attention). Resulting attention failures can have deleterious consequences for ongoing behavior, such as a lapse in attention causing us to miss our exit on the highway. Such failures may also impact later memory, for example, leading to poor performance on tests of material we encountered while being inattentive. Although fluctuations in attention are pervasive, researchers lack a way to track changes in attention over time, predict attention lapses, and characterize the consequences of attention fluctuations for subsequent memory in a variety of situations, such as watching a lecture or performing an attention task (e.g., a task that requires a person to monitor a stream of images and detect a rare target picture). This project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to predict attention fluctuations during psychological and ?naturalistic? tasks?like watching movies and listening to stories?and ask whether fMRI activity signatures of attentional states impact what people go on to remember at a later time. This work may help us better track attention changes and predict attention failures in lab-based and real-world contexts and will lead to a better understanding of the manner in which how we attend affects what we remember.<br/><br/>Recent work suggests that patterns of functional brain connectivity predict a person?s overall ability to sustain attention. Functional connectivity is measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reflects statistical dependence between the fMRI signal time-courses in two different brain regions. When regions are said to be strongly functionally connected, activity in those regions tends to increase and decrease in sync, whereas activity in regions that are weakly functionally connected varies out of sync. The proposed project asks whether changes in functional connectivity from one moment to the next?that is, functional connectivity dynamics?reflect changes in the degree to which a person is attending to the task at hand. The project will also characterize how these fluctuating attentional states affect ongoing behavior and later memory. Specifically, the investigators will collect fMRI data during three different types of scans. During each scan, volunteers will be asked to either perform attention tasks in which they press a button in response to certain pictures that appear in a stream of images on a screen, rest quietly, or watch movies or listen to stories?the latter of which more closely mirror real-world situations in which we commonly experience attention fluctuations. The researchers will ask three primary questions. First, how do functional connectivity dynamics (measured by calculating functional connectivity strength in short time windows during fMRI scans) relate to attention dynamics during the tasks, rest period, and narratives? Second, how overlapping or distinct are brain networks in which the strength of activity predicts overall sustained attention and attention fluctuations in different contexts (i.e., task performance, rest, and visual and auditory narrative perception)? Finally, how are brain signatures of attentional states during encoding of information related to later memory performance, including recognition of the images encountered during the attention tasks and verbal recall of the movie and story narratives? This work may improve our ability to track changes in focus over time and predict attention failures in experimental and naturalistic contexts. It will provide insights into the functional architecture of sustained attention itself and inform us about the relationships between sustained attention and memory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Internal body temperature is synchronized with sleep, and if body temperature is out of phase with the circadian cycle, relatively simple external stimuli can be applied to improve sleep. Similar arguments can be made for other diseases of contemporary society, such as obesity, fertility, and depression, and can be expanded beyond wellness to clinical applications such as neo-natal care and heat treatment of cancers. The value proposition is in enabling non-invasive, wearable, internal body temperature measurements with the highest accuracy and reliability on the market. The commercial potential of the proposed device is very large:  60 million US adults report frequent difficulty sleeping, with estimated indirect costs from insomnia due to loss of productivity as high as $60 billion annually. Once wearable sensor prototypes are developed, potential customers include medical device manufacturers and clinics.<br/><br/>The proposed project will produce a prototype of a low-cost, portable, internal body thermometer for personal wellness applications. The thermometer is based on the fundamental principle of passive electromagnetic measurements made by a device placed on the skin and operating in the microwave frequency range. The major challenge is detecting very small power levels radiated from deep tissue layers as opposed to measurements on the skin. The engineering challenge and intellectual merit lie in further developing the proof-of-principle hardware and algorithms to achieve a commercially viable device ready for marketing. Overcoming this challenge will result in specifications in terms of prototype temperature sensitivity, spatial resolution, battery life, robustness, and ease of use. Engineering challenges include designing an ultra-low noise receiver, implementing radio-frequency interference mitigation techniques, and designing flexible probe antennas conformal to the skin on different parts of the body, all with a focus on low-power compact implementations. After leveraging off-the-shelf components in the first phase, specialized chips will later be designed. The goal is to demonstrate an inexpensive device that can ultimately be disposable.

Such a unique capability has the potential to drastically transform the engineering design paradigm, inspiring innovative structures with spatially tailored multi-functional properties (e.g., physical, mechanical and thermal, etc.), which are strongly desired in many applications such as turbine blades. However, the complexity of phase formation resulted from the simultaneous deposition of disparate materials during additive manufacturing is least understood and hinders the ability to not only design, but also successfully produce materials of required functional gradients. This award supports fundamental research aimed at enabling the design and fabrication of functionally graded metallic materials using the laser powder-fed directed energy deposition process. The present research endeavors to develop comprehensive understanding of phase formation and transformations during layer-wise making of multi-component systems using integrated computational and experimental tools. In addition to its potential to reignite U.S. manufacturing, additive manufacturing?s power in tailoring properties within complex three-dimensional components will also significantly expand the design space and yield structures with enhanced integrity. The multidisciplinary nature of the research methodologies, along with crafted educational and outreach activities, will impact workforce development through the engagement of graduate and undergraduate students as well as the broader manufacturing community.<br/><br/>The objective of the present research is to uncover the underlying mechanism of phase formation during the fabrication, via directed energy deposition additive manufacturing, of functionally graded metallic materials. The research will include the construction of a new multi-component thermodynamic database covering the complete compositional space of interest using novel high throughput first-principles calculations, deep neural network machine learning models, and high throughput thermodynamic modeling tools with uncertainty quantification. With this database, a combination of thermodynamic phase equilibrium calculations and kinetic phase transformation simulations will be used for phases formation predictions. The models will be applied to design compositional pathways between two metallic alloys, in a nonlinear fashion, for successful gradients in order to, e.g., avoid detrimental intermetallic phases. The designed functionally graded materials will be realized using a directed energy deposition machine and blending two different powders (titanium alloy and iron-nickel alloy) varying along the build height according to the design. Further, the compositions, microstructures and mechanical properties of fabricated parts will be thoroughly characterized and quantitatively compared with simulation results to refine the computational models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many species, vocal communication occurs in large social groups, where high levels of background noise constrain a listener?s ability to hear and process vocalizations. In the context of human speech perception, these constraints are collectively known as the ""cocktail party problem,"" which refers to the difficulty of following a conversation in a crowd. Recognizing speech in noise is particularly challenging for people with hearing loss. At present, how the noise of a crowd constrains the brain?s ability to recognize vocalizations is poorly understood at a cellular level. Discovering the origin of these constraints and their impacts on vocal recognition is necessary to advance knowledge of the neural basis of hearing and vocal communication. Treefrogs are one example of an animal that encounters and solves a biological analog of the human cocktail party problem. During their breeding season, male treefrogs gather around suitable bodies of water where they produce loud mating calls in dense and noisy choruses to attract females. In order to reproduce, a female treefrog must recognize the vocalizations of a calling male of her species amid the cacophony of a noisy breeding chorus. This project integrates behavioral experiments with neurophysiological recordings from individual neurons in a subcortical area of the vertebrate brain to identify the mechanisms by which noise interferes with a female treefrog?s ability to extract information about species identity from the calls of a potential mate. The public outreach component of this project involves the creation of a new museum exhibit called ?Ear of the Beholder? at the Bakken Museum. The PI will host a formal graduate student exchange program between the labs of the PI and Co-PI and will have an extensive undergraduate research program with a special emphasis on under-represented populations in biological sciences.<br/><br/>Noise interferes with signal processing in two fundamentally different ways. ?Energetic? masking impairs signal detection in noise and occurs when signals and noise produce competing excitation in the same peripheral auditory filter, such that they directly compete on the auditory nerve. ?Informational? masking occurs when competing sounds disrupt central processes for extracting signal information, which in turn degrades signal recognition. Most behavioral studies of masking in animal communication focus on energetic masking. Few studies have investigated the neural basis of informational masking at a cellular level in animal models. Consequently, significant gaps remain in understanding how noise causes a breakdown of neural processing to give rise to vocal constraints with evolutionary consequences. This project integrates behavioral experiments on mate choice with extracellular and in vivo, whole-cell recordings of interval-counting neurons in the anuran inferior colliculus to investigate informational masking in Cope?s gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis). Female gray treefrogs only recognize sounds as mating calls when they exceed a threshold number of pulses in length, a process mediated by interval-counting neurons. This project tests the central hypothesis that concurrent sounds impair extraction of this temporal information by disrupting sound processing by temporally tuned interval-counting neurons in the inferior colliculus. Our working hypothesis is that informational masking increases the threshold number of pulses required for call recognition by altering the time-dependent integration of excitation and inhibition performed by interval-counting neurons. The expected outcome of this project is a better understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in hearing and vocal communication in noisy social groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some proteins, arginines can be chemically modified by addition of methyl groups.  However, it is not clear why this happens and what the outcomes are.  This project seeks to solve this puzzle by studying a specific protein in budding yeast that has methylated arginines and that also appears to be important for allowing cells to grow in different environments. Key goals are to discover how the process of arginine methylation is controlled and how arginine methylation affects protein function. Also, the project will serve as a platform for improving science education and developing science educators across multiple levels, through integration of educational outreach during research training. This includes specific outreach activities aimed at K-12 level. Recruitment of underrepresented minority, women, and persons with disabilities will be emphasized.<br/>   <br/>In eukaryotes, many RNA-binding proteins harbor protein arginine methylation. This post-translational modification is catalyzed by a family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes known as protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT). Genetic studies have revealed that protein arginine methylation contributes to the function of RNA-binding proteins, but it is not clear how this post-translational modification is regulated, and what the biological consequences of such regulation are. This project will address these questions by studying a model RNA-binding protein (called Npl3) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Npl3 is methylated on arginines by the major PRMT enzyme in yeast.  When methylated, Npl3 promotes splicing of pre-mRNAs that function at different times in the growth cycle. The goals of this project are to examine the molecular mechanisms by which protein arginine methylation in Npl3 is regulated and the consequences of such regulation at both molecular and cellular levels. A multi-faceted approach using molecular biology, biochemistry, proteomics, and genomic technologies will be utilized to carry out these studies.  The outcomes are expected to improve our understanding of the dynamics of protein arginine methylation and its effects on cellular adaptation to growth under different environmental conditions.<br/><br/>This research is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and the Cellular Dynamics and Function programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate of Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity are, like much of computer science, extremely technical fields that continue to advance at rapid rates both in knowledge and application. Computer science often allows a small team to leverage its members' expertise through the use of plug-and-play solutions that require little or no user intervention. In contrast, it has become obvious that reliance on a limited number of highly skilled people does not work as well for cybersecurity . This inadequacy appears to be addressable through the application of AI concepts and by training individuals who are expert in both AI and cybersecurity. However, the amount of time, focus, and effort required to become highly proficient in both AI and cybersecurity fields is a significant barrier to this solution. This project strives to explore potentially transformative educational approaches in order to prepare a more robust workforce at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. Specifically, the project team proposes a collaborative, group-based, and hands-on course that combines students with a specific interest and existing background in either the AI or cybersecurity domain with students with the complementary background.  This educational approach will produce students who share   a combined AI and cybersecurity mindset.<br/><br/>The fundamental assumption of this project is that students will rarely need to apply a deep, technical understanding of the AI field within the cybersecurity domain. As such, a more viable and succinct approach to producing a workforce competent in both domains is to focus on expanding students? toolkits and providing them reference-anchors.  This approach will enable students to more efficiently collaborate with domain-specific experts and across  domain boundaries when they enter the workforce. In   order to explore this approach, the project team proposes to develop a course directed at students with backgrounds in AI or cybersecurity. The course will combine elements from problem-based learning , studio-based learning, and group-based learning.   This approach will cultivate students with a melded AI and cybersecurity mindset even though they may lack technical depth in their non-focus domain. This mindset or awareness will prepare these students to enter the workforce and collaborate across technical disciplines.

Accordingly, the intended family of models, as well as the experiments to assess hypotheses, will address the following considerations: (1) urban freight carriers compete with one another, not only for market share but also for urban routes and parking that are also valued by commuters and hired ride services; (2) there is an undeniable dynamic aspect to the flows of vehicles and consumption goods over metropolitan road networks; moreover, those flows involve multiple time scales that make the comparative statics paradigm nearly meaningless; (3) in an effort to be competitive, electronic retailers (e-retailers) are drawn into pricing games that purposely blur the distinction between delivery fees and the prices of purchased goods, with the consequence that it is necessary to simultaneously model both freight service and urban goods provisioning; (4) indirect evidence exists that pricing strategies employed in e-commerce do not fully cover delivery costs; (5) some electronic retailers offer discounted and promotional shipping rates, creating unfunded liabilities that bring into doubt both the medium- and long-term sustainability of their core transactions; and (6) there is a gap between the demand for healthy foods and the minimum order size that makes it worthwhile for food purveyors to deliver to certain neighborhoods, thereby creating food underserved areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these networks can be highly vulnerable to failures. A small disturbance may bring the whole network across a tipping point and shift it abruptly and irreversibly to an undesired state, resulting in large catastrophic collapses. Examples are mass extinctions in ecological networks, cascading failures in power grids, and social convention changes in human and animal networks. Resilience is the ability of networked systems to adjust their activity to retain basic functionality and avoid large shifts in the face of internal disturbances and environmental changes. The cost of resilience loss sometimes is unaffordable: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused over two million deaths worldwide as of January 25, 2021, and continues to kill increasingly more people and shut down increasingly more economic activities. This award aims to develop a universal theoretical and practical foundation for the resilience of complex networked systems, for systems from different fields, such as biology, ecology, transportation, and many more. This award will design fast and accurate algorithms to predict a system's resilience even when only partial information is known, offering ways to prevent the collapse of ecological, biological, or economic systems and guide the design of technological systems resilient to both internal failures and environmental changes. Students, including K-12, will be engaged in learning about networks and resilience in multiple ways, ranging from research opportunities to lectures and a cyber-attack game design, where the defender aims to create a resilient network with limited recourses to withstand the attacker's strategic damages.<br/><br/><br/>The technical aims of the project are divided into three thrusts. The first thrust creates a unified theory that captures a universal resilience behavior of different systems by relaxing some assumptions and recognizing different types of interactions between the dynamical components and among interacting systems. The second thrust designs fast and accurate algorithms for predicting systems' resilience with incomplete information on the topology or dynamics. The last thrust develops mathematical tools for resilience enhancement through topology adaptation and state-based control to characterize their readiness during the operation trajectory and throughout the recovery process, enabling sustainable, recoverable, and resilient system design. These three research thrusts will be validated by a comprehensive evaluation of the progress, including computer simulations and real-world experiments. This research effort will produce the foundation for network resilience that allows prediction and controlling it with sufficient generality to apply it to many areas where resilience to adverse perturbations is of paramount concern. This CAREER project enables a paradigm shift in how network resilience is currently understood, yielding transformative ideas to enhance how networked systems can best be built and managed (human-made systems) or self-organized and adapted (natural systems) to enhance their resilience to internal failures and external environmental changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous work has shown that only a fraction of cyber abuse victims adopt self-protective behaviors. This may occur because some victims lack the background knowledge required to identify cyber abuse and to assert appropriate protective behaviors. While education can be effective in this regard, classroom delivery may fail to reproduce the diverse and dynamic context of cyber abuse, making it difficult for students to effectively translate knowledge into practice. This project seeks to increase the adoption of self-protective behaviors by integrating educational content into social networking interactions. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques will be used to optimize the placement and timing of educational content. The project has the potential to improve the security and privacy of vulnerable social network users.<br/><br/>The project team will leverage their expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and education to investigate, develop and evaluate a new educational framework that provides just-in-time awareness training to identify and respond appropriately to cyber abuse when using social networks. First, the team will develop AI-based solutions to detect and classify cyber abuse based on abuse traces in the accounts of the users involved. The team will also leverage data and feedback collected from study participants to build a ground-truth dataset of instances and timelines of cyber abuse. Second, the team will design and implement targeted learning content and user interface nudges to deliver the knowledge required to make safer decisions in social network interactions. Third, the team will develop AI-based techniques to determine the ideal placement of learning content that improves user adoption of self-protective behaviors. Finally, the unique features of Facebook will be exploited to design evaluation experiments and educational outcomes-based techniques that capture user behaviors in the context of their regular Facebook interactions.<br/><br/>This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education.

Current search technologies typically find many relevant documents, but do not extract and organize the information content of these documents or suggest new scientific hypotheses based on this organized content. Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies are a recognized means to approach this problem, and this project develops the cyberinfrastructure to support sophisticated search and retrieval from scientific publications, use and augmentation of facilities for advanced and well-established natural language processing and machine learning tools, and extraction and aggregation of data from scientific publications. The project leverages two NSF-funded projects: the Language Applications (LAPPS) Grid, which has already proven to be an effective platform for development of NLP applications; and University of Wisconsin?s xDD (formerly, GeoDeepDive), a scalable, dependable infrastructure capable of rapidly growing a digital library of scientific publications, currently including over 13 million documents from multiple distributed commercial and open-access providers. The effort significantly enhances the value of these existing NSF-funded infrastructures by providing access to services for mining scientific publications and lowering the barriers to entry resulting from licensing, redistribution, and intellectual property issues. Scientists may perform large-scale text retrieval and mining using the University of Wisconsin?s high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure through a web-based interface. Iterative domain adaptation capabilities allow scientists to easily adapt existing services to specialized areas without configuring or installing additional components. The potential impact of the cyberinfrastructure is applicable to any community that relies on computational tools for mining large textual datasets, including researchers in sociology, psychology, economics, education, linguistics, digital media, and the humanities.<br/><br/>This project extends the LAPPS Grid to provide access to UW-xDD?s collection of scientific publications and UW?s High Performance Computing facilities, as well as means to rapidly adapt existing, well-established natural language processing and machine learning software tools to new domains and evaluate results. The LAPPs Grid provides a large collection of NLP tools from a wide variety of sources exposed as web services, together with multiple commonly used resources and a front-end document retrieval engine currently configured to access PubMed/PubMedCentral as well as nightly updates of the CORD-19 dataset. The LAPPS Grid is open source, and can be run from the web, on a user?s laptop or desktop, in the cloud, or as a self-contained docker image when it is necessary to protect sensitive or licensed data, when there is no network connection available, or for deployment on remote HPC facilities. All tools and resources can be used interoperably, eliminating the effort required to convert input and output formats to use a set of tools or resources together.  xDD is one of the world?s largest single repositories of scientific publications that spans all domains of knowledge, incorporates new documents automatically and updates API endpoints every hour.  xDD has accumulated millions of documents from multiple commercial and open-access publishers (over 13M publications).  The xDD infrastructure is an integral part of the developing UW-COSMOS pipeline, which consists of a suite of services supporting document processing, including ingestion and parsing of PDFs; extraction of individual document objects such as text sections, figures, tables, and captions; and recall, which creates searchable Anserini and ElasticSearch indexes on the contexts and objects to enable retrieval of information. Specific project activities include implementing efficient retrieval and analysis of xDD?s vast holdings of scientific publications; extending the NLP capabilities of the LAPPS Grid for scientific publication mining and domain adaptation; developing full interoperability between the Grid and xDD/COSMOS; scaling LAPPS Grid services to handle the very large textual datasets available from UW-xDD; and surveying visualization techniques and integrating them into the Grid.<br/><br/>This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the NSF Division of Information and Intelligent Systems within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and the NSF Public Access program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Huiyuan Zhu and Hongliang Xin of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University are studying new strategies to improve the performance of catalysts that recycle carbon dioxide (CO2) using renewable electricity. Traditional metal electrodes, including precious metals (Au, Ag) and base metals (Cu, Zn), have shown encouraging performance toward CO2 reduction. However, the process is limited by low energy efficiency and poor product selectivity. These processes are conducted in water, and the competing reduction of water to H2 is largely responsible for this inefficiency. This proposal addresses this challenge using ionic liquids as non-aqueous electrolytes together with electrode materials designed to work with ionic liquids. The educational components of the project include the following: (1) The interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in electrochemical techniques, materials characterization, and molecular modeling. (2) The involvement of diverse underrepresented groups including female students in science and engineering. (3) The implementation of STEM outreach programs to K-12 students from diverse groups and low-income families through hands-on demonstrations that illustrate the importance of nanomaterials, modeling, catalysis, and energy in our daily life. Undergraduate summer interns from underrepresented minority groups will be recruited to  work on this project through a partnership with Hampton University. <br/> <br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Drs. Huiyuan Zhu and Hongliang Xin of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University are studying a cooperative site and electrolyte tuning strategy for the rational design of electrocatalytic systems to get beyond energy-scaling limitations, specifically for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) on bismuth-based bimetallic nanocatalysts with non-aqueous ionic liquid electrolytes. The known Sabatier principle, arising from the adsorption-energy scaling relations at geometrically similar sites, generally imposes volcano-shaped constraints on the attainable catalytic performance. The Zhu-Xin team hypothesizes that the crucial charge-transfer intermediates toward CO2 reduction can be stabilized by cooperatively tailoring the p-band of active Bi sites via doping and heterocyclic cations of ionic liquids, while the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is suppressed. Using a combination of precision synthesis, electrocatalysis, advanced characterization techniques, as well as molecular modeling tools, the team seeks to uncover structure-reactivity relationships at the interface of nanoparticles and ionic liquid electrolytes. Success of this proposed research has the potential to advance fundamental understanding of CO2 reduction chemistry and provide guiding principles for catalyst design to address current challenges in eCO2RR. The atomistic insights into physicochemical properties of solid-electrolyte interfaces from this project may provide guidance for the design of other electrocatalytic transformations. Beyond scientific and technical impact, this project will train students at the interface of materials chemistry, quantum-chemical modeling, and catalysis, and prepare them for career pathways in academia and/or industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many current analysis approaches yield only simplified results instead of stratifications of physical properties. The project will develop an automatic, semi-empirical method to convert such results of lower complexity to atmospheric stratifications wherever they cannot be directly derived from an inversion of spectra. The method will be tested on observations of sunspots, where additional constraints on the magnetic field topology, connectivity and the gas density are available from the well-organized spatial structuring and magnetic field extrapolations. The results will enable one to address nearly all currently open questions in relation to the lower solar atmosphere, e.g., understanding the fine-structure and the properties of mass flows and oscillations inside sunspots from deep in the photosphere to the chromosphere.  This will add to our understanding of the basic properties of sunspots, which are some of the most enigmatic objects in astrophysics.  Sunspots are an integral part of late-type stars, play a vital role in stellar evolution and can influence life-supporting exoplanets including the Earth through space weather events that are rooted in sunspots and the active regions that host them.  <br/><br/>The method to infer the thermodynamic and magnetic structure of the solar atmosphere will be based on a piece-wise analysis of different photospheric and chromospheric spectral lines with already available inversion codes and the additional tools developed during the project.  For any spectral line where current analysis methods do not provide stratifications of physical parameters of the solar atmosphere, e.g., the prominent chromospheric spectral line of neutral Hydrogen Alpha at 656 nm, a semi-empirical method using external constraints from magnetic field extrapolations will be employed to convert the results retrieved from a simplified modeling of the radiative transfer to stratifications.  A major effort will be to consistently convert and combine the stratifications from different height regimes into a single atmospheric stratification of all relevant thermodynamic and magnetic parameters from 0 to about 5 Mm in the solar atmosphere.  The resulting atmospheric model is expected to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, to provide all physical parameters on a geometrical height scale and to reproduce all observed spectral lines when a spectral synthesis of the model atmosphere is executed.  A successful demonstration of the reliability of the approach on sunspot observations, where additional constraints are available because of the spatial continuity of the magnetic field topology, will allow one to decide on its suitability for observations of arbitrary solar targets.  Any scientific question that requires accurate physical properties of the lower solar atmosphere can potentially be addressed with the results of the analysis approach.  The tool developed through this project will be freely available to the community of solar researchers and will help in fully exploiting the observations with the NSF?s 4-meter class Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope.  The participation of underrepresented students at California State University Northridge to both analyze and visualize the high-resolution spectropolarimetric data will prepare a future generation of the scientific workforce in solar physics.

Sand gets carried by winds and currents, and then piles up into dunes and shoals. These dunes and shoals encroach on farmland and pose shipping hazards, but also protect coastal ecosystems and trap nutrients and moisture. The difficulty is to predict the conditions under which sand will move, rather than stay put. The way steady flows cause sand to move are relatively well understood, but in practice flows are unsteady and turbulent. The distinguishing feature of turbulence is that it pushes and pulls on the surface of sand beds and so helps the sand to come loose. This project introduces a new laboratory experiment that encapsulates the particular pushing and pulling action of turbulence in order understand precisely how it contributes to the motions of sand, so that we can predict when sand will move. <br/><br/>The goals of the project are to determine the conditions under which oscillating pressure gradients in fluid flow over porous granular beds cause bed failure, and to model the subsequent evolution of the beds once failure has occurred. A laboratory experiment, which is notably compact relative to the majority of those that investigate sediment transport by fluid flows, generates failure in a bed of fluid-saturated glass beads by the oscillations of a metal plate immersed in the fluid above the bed. Variation of the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations permit characterization of the bed response over a wide range of conditions. Through large variation in the density ratio between the sediment and fluid by means of a variable pressure gaseous atmosphere above and within the bed, the project has the potential to reveal how the mechanisms of bed failure differ over the full range observed on earth in the atmosphere and oceans, as well as on other planets or moons with both thicker and thinner atmospheres.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These nanoscale electronic devices exhibit quantum mechanical behaviors which can potentially be used to realize quantum computing devices that offer significant computational advantages over current computing architectures. Furthermore, these trapped electrons can act as quantum light sources, which would help enable quantum devices that are secure against cyber-attacks. Over the past 20 years, optically driven quantum dots have been pursued in a variety of semiconductor systems and have been shown to exhibit many of the necessary properties that are required for quantum computing architectures. However, previous quantum dot architectures have not been able to reliably scale up to a large number of quantum dots with sufficient control to be used for quantum devices. In this project, a new type of quantum dot will be engineered based on two-dimensional materials which are only a few atomic layers thick. The proposed quantum dot consists of two semiconductor monolayers stacked together to realize electrons whose energies can be tuned electrically. Using nanofabrication techniques, small holes will be patterned onto the device, which will form the quantum dot. The quantum properties of the quantum dot will be measured using state-of-the-art optical techniques. This new quantum dot architecture has the potential to overcome previous limitations because it offers control over the quantum dot position and energy. This research aligns with the NSF Big Idea of the Quantum Leap: Leading the Next Quantum Revolution by developing material systems that have the potential to enable these new quantum information technologies. Furthermore, the project strengthens the STEM workforce both directly and indirectly by training and mentoring graduate, undergraduate, and high school students through the proposed research, and by encouraging interest in STEM at the high school level in southern Arizona. <br/><br/>The overarching project objective is to achieve deterministic, scalable, and tunable quantum information devices based on optically driven spin-valley electrons in novel two-dimensional (2D) material heterostructures. Specifically, a nano-patterned gate engineering architecture will be explored to realize localized quantum states of single electrons and single excitons in MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructures. This architecture will enable electrostatic quantum dots (eQDs) that are predicted to exhibit the desired high levels of tunability, spectral stability, and long coherence times necessary for spin-valley qubits with applications in quantum processing and quantum information storage. In solid state systems, QDs can support single photon emitter behavior and, once charged, establish a long-lived, ground-state spin qubit that can be coherently controlled optically and potentially realize long range interactions via entangled photons. Although other solid-state spin systems (III-V QDs, vacancy centers) have demonstrated the single qubit requirements, scaling these solid-state qubits to large numbers has been limited by inhomogeneity in QDs and photonic integration challenges for vacancy centers. These challenges motivate the development of a new solid-state spin qubit system that is both deterministic and tunable?allowing for control of both the spatial placement and qubit energy. In this project, novel eQD structures will be engineered and fabricated. The eQD quantum states and coherence properties will be measured using a combination of far-field spectroscopy and near field scanning optical microscopy. Coherent control of single spin-valley qubits will be demonstrated using coherent nonlinear spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a critical need for new technology to address this problem.  However, creating the technology calls for very collaborative efforts between academic researchers with unique technical expertise and industry companies with deep product development expertise.  The Georgia Tech site of the Building Reliable Advances and Innovations in Neurotechnology (BRAIN) Center will develop product-ready technology innovations that prevent brain disorders and provide better diagnosis and treatment for affected patients.  The Georgia Tech site will also initiate new industry-focused programs promoting diversity and education.<br/><br/>Building the aforementioned technologies requires fundamental understanding of the brain, which is limited by the state-of-the-art in basic science and engineering.  Understanding is advancing through innovative research; however, research impact is currently limited because innovation greatly outpaces productization due to insufficient shepherding of innovation through the ?valley of death? in the translational pipeline.  To address this shortcoming, the Georgia Tech BRAIN Center site will develop product-ready neurotechnology innovations by spanning science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, model systems (e.g., human, animal, in vitro, and computational), spatial scales (i.e., neuron to organism), and brain function verticals (e.g., neurovascular and neurological).<br/><br/>Another thrust area of the Georgia Tech site is Neuroethics. Emerging neurotechnologies present enormous ethical implications relating to autonomy, identity, and privacy.

Peanut allergies affect a large population and can be extremely dangerous for those with the most severe forms. Given the ubiquity of peanut products, peanut allergy is a significant medical and legal concern worldwide, with a rising incidence of this potentially fatal condition in children.  An allergen-free peanut developed from this project has the potential to significantly dampen the life-threatening reactions to peanuts, as well as the following benefits: (1) reducing the overall incidence of food allergy, (2) preserving human lives by eliminating anaphylaxis and death caused by accidental ingestion of peanut, (3) eliminating emotional distress of peanut allergic individuals and their families, (4) enhancing the public perception of peanuts as a health-promoting food, and (5) reducing the number of product recalls due to peanut contamination. <br/> <br/>The proposed project aims to develop and to commercialize an allergen-free peanut devoid of all clinically documented allergens using a genome-editing tool such as CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated system). Allergic reactions to peanut occur shortly after contact of peanut allergens with their specific IgE antibodies already bound to mast cells. The crosslinking of allergen specific IgE by the respective peanut allergens stimulates mast cells to release chemical mediators responsible for the clinical symptoms including sometime anaphylactic shock or death. Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and Ara h 6 are the most clinically documented peanut allergens. The objectives of the project are: (1) Construct and validate vectors for Ara h gene editing, transform peanut embryogenic callus and regenerate T0 peanut plants; (2) Identify T0 individuals with deletions in Ara h genes; (3) Assemble lines carrying homozygous deletions in all target Ara h genes; (5) Characterize the selected lines for Ara h mRNA and protein expression; (6) Assess vegetative development of Arah-free lines under greenhouse conditions. If the resulting plants demonstrate tolerance to the gene deletions, the allergen-free peanut will be very significant in protecting the peanut sensitive populations and promoting peanut sales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those include large earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions which at times are explosive.  These destructive events present major threats to human societies. They often cause human casualties and economic losses. The Mexican subduction zone has been responsible for large, devasting earthquakes throughout the past century.  It is marked by the Middle American Trench off the coast of Mexico. There, the Cocos Plate dives beneath the continental North American Plate. It was responsible for the September 7, 2017 Tehuantepec, Mexico earthquake of magnitude 8.2 on the Richter scale.  Here, the researchers investigate what caused this destructive event. They use data collected by a rapid seismic-array deployment following the earthquake.  Analyzing the high-resolution data, they gradually unveil subduction-zone processes and earthquake mechanisms.  This project leverages an international partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and several institutions in Mexico. It also provides training for graduate and undergraduate students, notably from groups underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>Here the team analyze a high-quality, unique aftershock dataset from the 2017 Tehuantepec earthquake.  The data were collected after a seismic deployment supported by a RAPID award. The RAPID network augmented permanent and temporary networks deployed by the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico (UNAM). It included ten broadband instruments deployed in early Oct. 2017 (that recorded data for 6 months) and 51 UTEP-owned Nodes (5-Hz, 3-component geophones, active for 22 days). During the broadband deployment, the Servicio Sismológico Nacional (SSN) recorded over 30,000 aftershocks. This highlights the robust nature of earthquake generation. The project goal is to answer fundamental and specific questions that relate to subduction zone processes. Fundamental questions, determined by community efforts, include: when and where do large earthquakes happen? How do spatial variations in subduction inputs affect seismicity and magmatism? How are surface processes linked to subduction? Specific questions about the Mexican subduction zone are: will the Tehuantepec earthquake load the upper plate and possibly trigger a large earthquake on the plate interface? Are the Tehuantepec and subsequent earthquakes linked? These earthquakes are the September 19, 2017 Morelos-Puebla, Mexico (M7.1), the February 18, 2018 Pinotepa Nacional, Mexico (M7.2), and the June 23, 2020 (M7.4) La Crucecita. To answer these questions, the researchers merge the various datasets which builds a foundation for five complementary approaches: 1) calculate a high-resolution aftershock dataset; 2) analyze seismicity and stress, 3) search for earthquake triggering mechanisms, 4) define the structure of the subduction zone, and 5) integrate results to address remaining questions. This project strengthens a strong collaboration between UTEP and, in Mexico, UNAM, the SSN, and the Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This NSF CAREER project aims to develop a new nanotechnology to selectively control neural activity for the next generation of brain malfunction therapies, e.g., the treatment of epilepsy. The project will (1) lead to a completely new paradigm for the precise control of neural activity, (2) provide the research community with a new platform for mapping brain circuits to improve our understanding of complex neural networks, (3) enable the on-demand localized release of drugs required for the next generation of therapies, and (4) accelerate the development of wireless technologies for the treatment of brain malfunctions. As part of an education objective to integrate this research into an educational program designed to increase student interest and improve performance in STEM fields, the investigator will (1) develop new student-centered learning activities to promote metacognition (?learning to learn?) in undergraduate Biotransport Phenomena education, (2) provide research access and training in nanoscale heat and mass transport to local high school teachers, (3) create developmentally appropriate standards-based high school activities and lessons reaching to approximately 2,000 local high school students in San Antonio and (4) continue to recruit and mentor underrepresented minority students in engineering by serving as a Latina role model in academia.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term research goal is to build an innovative and productive research program to investigate nanoscale transport phenomena principles for the development of novel neuromodulation and new nanotechnological platforms to revolutionize the precise control of neural networks.  Toward this goal, this CAREER project will develop a soft magnetic nanomaterials platform to enable a stable pharmacological, non-toxic, targetable strategy for neuromodulation by transducing alternating magnetic fields into chemical stimulus. The project addresses the need for a technique for evoking and inhibiting neural activity on demand to understand the basic biology of neural circuit dynamics that considers cell-type specificity but does not require pharmacological agents, delivery of transgenes, or implantable devices that are damaging to biological tissue. This will be accomplished by surface engineering magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with biocompatible temperature responsive polymer brushes loaded with neuromodulatory compounds. The heat generated by the MNPs under alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) will trigger conformational changes in their polymer coating releasing loaded neuromodulators. The local release of neuromodulatory compounds will enhance or inhibit specific cell membrane receptors inducing neural depolarization.  The system will be investigated for the possible management of epileptic seizures by modulating hippocampal neural activity on-demand through the local release of verapamil and bay-K8644 from MNPs targeted to the cell membrane. The research plan is organized under three aims: (1) Investigate the synthesis and characterization of biocompatible temperature-responsive polymer brushes, (2) Investigate polymer brushes coatings on magnetic nanoparticles surface for the entrapment of neuromodulatory compounds and its on-demand release, and (3) Design a magnetothermal pharmacological paradigm for precise modulation of neural activity,<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Throughout their graduate studies, biomedical students immerse themselves in research, with little or no training in best teaching practices or knowledge of alternative, non-academic career opportunities, such as industry or government agencies. As a result, graduates who do not continue with traditional academic careers struggle with the transition to non-academic careers because they know very little about alternatives; also, those who remain in academics and research struggle with the increasing teaching demands they face as faculty. While graduate school used to be considered a rite of passage to a career in academic research, a job in academics is no longer a guarantee. Thus, biomedical graduate programs have a responsibility to reconsider how they are training their students for their careers after graduation.  The goal of this project is to develop a course sequence for graduate students to learn more about alternative careers and best teaching practices.  The graduate students will not only learn about careers and teaching practices, but they also will work with postdoctoral fellows and faculty to translate what they learn into an undergraduate classroom.  This will give them a chance to have a first-hand teaching experience and consider how to develop the critical skills needed by today's biomedical workforce.  <br/><br/>The purpose of this Design and Development project is to develop a transferrable model for graduate student professional development as both educators and non-academics. Graduate education is faced with two fundamental problems: 1) students who choose to pursue academics are not trained how to teach; and, 2) graduates who choose to leave academics have little exposure to alternative postgraduate opportunities. This project focuses on developing an Incubator/Apprenticeship Model that exposes graduate students to the rapidly changing world of science and technology innovations and workforce trends, while being immersed in the exploration of learning theories and research-based teaching approaches for curriculum design (e.g. problem-based learning, active learning). As a result, graduate students will participate in an immersive curriculum development experience informed by evidence-based practices and be exposed to non-academic postgraduate opportunities commonly not addressed directly in higher education. The development of this innovation leverages the instructional design process, social constructivist theory, situated learning theory, and instructor beliefs. While this proof of concept is grounded in the context of biomedical engineering, the proposed theory of action is broadly applicable.  The impact of the proposed sequence will be studied qualitatively and quantitatively.  Students will be surveyed pre- and post-instruction.  A subset of students will also be interviewed.  This proposed instructional design sequence is a proof of concept for a novel, transferrable model for programs to foster graduate student professional development that is responsive to the rapidly changing world of science and technology innovations and workforce trends.  Results will be disseminated on the University of Michigan Biomedical Enginering Transforming Engineering Education website and through educational conferences and journal articles.

More can be learned about the types of pathogens that have been most important in primate evolution, the types of genetic variants that have arisen to deal with these threats, and whether genetic variation in immune genes influences fitness-related traits in the present. This doctoral dissertation project studies the regulation of genes involved in immune defense in a wild primate system, focusing on an intensively studied population for which demographic, behavioral, and physiological data are also available. The doctoral student investigates how natural selection has shaped the gene expression response to pathogens in the past, and examines associations between immune-related gene expression variation, dominance rank, and other physiological characteristics. The project supports student mentorship and training opportunities, international research collaborations, and public science engagement through museum and conference events. <br/><br/>The investigator measures genome-wide gene expression in either the presence or absence of stimuli that model bacterial or viral infection, for 160 individually recognized adult baboons. Differences in immune responses are examined for linkages to genetic differences between baboons, controlling for age, dominance rank, kinship, and other factors that also influence immune function. Integrating these findings with genome sequences from the same baboon population, the project investigates whether genes involved in the immune response to bacteria and/or viruses have been the target of historic or recent selection and tests whether genetic variation that influences the immune response also affects traits that are important to current physiological wellbeing and fitness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Restoring arm and hand function would greatly increase their independence.  Assistive robotics and functional electrical stimulation can potentially restore arm and hand function, but each has significant drawbacks. The objective of this project is to develop a cooperative control strategy for functional elbow and wrist movements in people with high cervical spinal cord injuries using functional electrical stimulation and a robotic exoskeleton. The results of the project will help move functional electrical stimulation and upper limb robotics from laboratory assistive technologies to wearable devices used for everyday tasks by people with full-arm paralysis.      <br/><br/>The complementary strengths of functional electrical stimulation (FES) and assistive robotics can potentially enable people with high tetraplegia to independently feed and groom themselves. FES provides free power using a person?s own muscles but cannot sufficiently control all joints simultaneously due to permanent denervation of some muscles. Assistive robots can provide additional power and control, but can be rigid, bulky, and heavy. This project's objective is to develop a cooperative control strategy that demonstrates functional elbow and wrist movements in people with high tetraplegia using a hybrid FES+rigid support robot. By maximizing the utility of muscles activated by FES, the proposed hybrid strategy will reduce the need for robot power and size, paving the way for using FES with soft wearable robotics. This project will use a rigid robot as the testbed for developing cooperative control strategies, allowing for exploration of the entire design space for future development of soft wearable exosuits coupled with FES. FES+robot assisted muscle-induced torques will be measured in real time during elbow and wrist movements. This information will feed into a coordinated FES+robot control scheme that aims to decrease robot work while maintaining tracking accuracy. Performance and robustness of the control scheme will be benchmarked for varying robot capabilities during a self-feeding task. The outcome will be a model, mapping robot capabilities to task completion success, to be used to design future wearable hybrid FES-robotic systems for upper limb movement restoration. These advances will open up new research horizons in commanding and controlling hybrid neuroprostheses that could not otherwise be achieved.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In support of this goal, mathematics educators have developed a variety of instructional practices designed to move students beyond seeing mathematics as a set of disconnected procedures and facts to appreciating it as a coherent set of ideas and tools. These practices have been growing in popularity across mathematics classrooms, but it is unclear if students? mature number sense is improving. One reason for slow progress is that the field currently lacks a rigorously validated measure of mature number sense that is both widely accepted and easy to use. Moreover, even though mathematics educators generally agree on the importance of mature number sense, there is little evidence demonstrating that it is a measurably distinct characteristic of mathematical cognition. Lack of such knowledge is a critical problem because, without it, researchers cannot explain, predict, and study mature number sense, and teachers are left to rely on their own intuitions about whether and how to focus on it in their classrooms. In this project, researchers will advance fundamental knowledge of mathematical cognition through the development of innovative metrics and methods to assess mature number sense with valid and reliable scores for use with students in grades 3-8. <br/><br/>The central hypothesis is that mature number sense is a measurable characteristic of mathematical cognition, separable from both domain-specific knowledge (e.g., arithmetic fluency, fraction knowledge) and domain-general constructs (e.g., creativity, cognitive flexibility), that predicts math-related beliefs and achievement. The research team will work with a diverse sample of students in grades 3-8 to refine, extend, and validate a brief assessment of mature number sense. They will start with a measure that they iteratively developed and validated in a large pilot study with middle and high school students, and they will optimize it as the ?middle school form? (for grades 6-8). They will collect additional evidence of validity for this form by comparing it to other, more lengthy measures of mature number sense and by conducting a longitudinal study to examine if scores on the measure in fall predict grade-level mathematics learning and math-related beliefs in spring. Next, they will extend the measure downward to include upper elementary grades 3-5. Items will be iteratively developed and examined for construct relevance using expert ratings, classical and IRT item statistics, and retrospective think-aloud strategy reports of students during problem solving. The researchers will examine if the factor structure of the elementary form is the same as that found with the middle school form, testing measurement invariance across the two grade-level groupings. They also will develop a technical manual for researchers and teachers. By the end of the project, there will be a practical, validated assessment of mature number sense for students in grades 3-8 that is easy to administer in schools, after-school programs, research laboratories, and homes. The target audiences for this measure include basic researchers interested in studying mathematical cognition, intervention researchers interested in studying the effects of innovative instructional practices on students? number sense, and teachers who wish to monitor their students? progress toward the ?processes and proficiencies? with longstanding importance in mathematics education.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Educational activities on communal care and healthy lifestyles will be tested with middle and high school students participating in three University of Tennessee at Chattanooga outreach programs (GEAR UP, Upward Bound, Upward Bound Math & Science). Activities will be made available online to the general public. Co-PI Bauer will write posts for several social media platforms about how the stress of parenting can be mitigated through family help, societal assistance, and cultural support.<br/> <br/>The scientific objective of this IRES is to determine how ecology shapes the reproductive consequences of communal breeding, a social strategy in which multiple mothers nurse offspring communally. The overarching experiment is a manipulative field study to determine how low food abundance influences the endocrine and oxidative stress of communally breeding Octodon degus, a social rodent endemic to Chile. Students will conduct independent projects within the framework of this study and will also analyze a long-term dataset. This program supports 5-6 students per year (2 undergrad, 3-4 graduate; 15 individuals over a three-year period). Students will engage in year-long collaborations with one or more of the PIs? four collaborators at four academic institutions in Santiago, Chile. Students interested in studying how social interactions impact stress physiology will collaborate with an expert on social networks and former IRES student at the Universit? de Sherbrooke, Canada. Prior to IRES, international collaborators will provide feedback on project designs and grant proposals. IRES will last 8-10 weeks (June-August) for undergraduate students and 18-20 weeks (June-October) for graduate students. Post-IRES, international collaborators will provide feedback on analyses, presentations, and manuscripts, thereby increasing the likelihood of student productivity and success. Program outcomes, student perceptions of the program and science, and student progression in STEM will be assessed annually during and up to 3 years beyond the proposed program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The envisioned product is a tool for ordinary farmers to increase their production and reduce unnecessary and unpredictable costs, reducing negative impacts on the environment and leading to higher quality food on the table. By converting once complicated, slow, inaccurate practices of insect identification to automated and highly accurate and in real time, this technology will be a part of the automation and data driven industrialization wave transforming the agricultural sector. The quick reaction to pest infestation will allow farmers to better target their response, ultimately making farming more efficient and sustainable. <br/><br/>Effective pest control in agriculture is imperative for growers to prevent major crop loss. Certain insect pests are responsible for such significant crop damage which provokes growers to invest in expensive and time-consuming measures to minimize pest effects. The reaction of the grower to the pest is time-sensitive; the timing of the treatment application will directly determine its effectiveness. The proposed technology is an innovative ground-based sensor system that detects plurality of airborne pests in real-time along with their geolocation information. It has capabilities for differentiation and identification of different insect species detected in flight. The instantaneous knowledge of the location of the pest allows for a targeted spray rather than spraying an entire field. Targeted sprays reduce unnecessary spraying and promote more sustainable pest treatment practices. The low-cost sensor that is adequately accurate finally places growers a few steps ahead of the problem, leading them to make wiser treatment decisions such as choosing the time of day to avoid harming beneficial pests and for mitigating drift. The sensor replaces and completely automates the current methods for monitoring insect activity in the crop field, with much better efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, starting with quantum mechanics, a great number of models emerged that led to mathematical problems involving variables that no longer commute. Noncommutative Algebra is one of the areas of mathematics that studies those structures. The research projects that are funded by this award investigate the interrelations between the commutative and noncommutative settings, using a branch of geometry called Poisson geometry. Three other approaches are used to study the noncommutative setting:  a combinatorial approach based on intricate internal transformations of the objects, called cluster mutations;  an algebraic approach that investigates intrinsically defined structures called Calabi-Yau categories; and  a noncommutative geometric approach using quantum versions of symmetric spaces. The four approaches are simultaneously used to carry out a detailed study of the properties and symmetries of noncommutative objects. Further, the noncommutative objects are shown to exhibit various forms of rigidity. This is used to settle problems in algebra, geometry, combinators, and dynamical systems that were previously posed without any reference to the noncommutative setting. These research activities will be used as the foundation for the training of graduate and undergraduate students and for mentoring mathematics postdocs.<br/><br/>The research projects funded under this awaard investigate problems in noncommutative algebra, quantum symmetric spaces, and noncommutative projective algebraic geometry and the relations of these problems to Poisson geometry, combinatorics, triangulated categories, and integrable systems. On the one hand, the program aims at using methods from the latter areas to describe the structure and representations of quantum cluster algebras at roots of unity, the Drinfeld doubles of Nichols algebras, the algebras that appear in the theory of quantum symmetric pairs, and the algebras that describe noncommutative projective spaces. In the opposite direction, previously posed problems in the latter areas are converted to problems for noncommutative algebras and their representation categories, and are then resolved within that setting. One of the directions of this program is the construction of universal K-matrices on the symmetric subalgebras of the Drinfeld doubles of Nichols algebras, and using this to study the ring theoretic properties of Nichols algebras. Another direction aims at the classification of irreducible representations of Nichols algebras of diagonal type using Poisson orders and noncommutative discriminants. A third direction develops a general setting for the study of finite dimensional representations of quantum cluster algebras at root of unity using Poisson geometry and Cayley-Hamilton algebras. Three additional directions investigate the geometry of noncommutative projective spaces modeled by higher dimensional elliptic algebras, the structure of 2-Calabi-Yau categories via categorical C-vectors and dynamical systems, and the construction of integral quantum cluster algebra structures on the canonical forms of quantized coordinate rings of varieties in theory of Lie groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the current methodology is heavily reliant upon linear approaches and some ad hoc methods are often used to handle nonlinear data, rendering the final results of analysis difficult to interpret. As a result, there is acute need for systematic development of new theoretical and methodological framework for improved prediction that takes into account the nonlinear features of the time series data. The proposed research seeks to address this need directly by developing new capabilities that will build on the existing linear theory for Gaussian and provide substantially improved prediction. In addition to advancing the statistical science and related scientific applications, it will also have potential impact on the practice of seasonal adjustments for better public policy formulation in the US and other nations.<br/><br/><br/>This project seeks to develop new theory and methodology for prediction for non-Gaussian, nonlinear processes, utilizing the tools of higher-order auto-cumulant functions and polyspectra. Specifically, the goals of the project include : (i) developing quadratic and higher order nonlinear predictors, with demonstrable improvements, (ii) extending forecasting approaches for a new class of so-called quadratically predictable processes; (iii) developing nonlinear models-fitting via an appropriate generalization of the Whittle likelihood, derived from the mean squared error of the one-step ahead quadratic forecasting filter, (iv) developing theoretical foundations of auto-cumulants for multi-linear forms that are paramount to derive third and higher order polynomial predictors,(v) developing algorithms and supporting software in R for implementation of the methodology.

While important strides have been made in understanding how forests respond to individual droughts, the long-term response to multiple drought events is unclear. Thus, the response of forests to multiple climate extremes like severe drought is unknown but critical for predicting future forest health and resilience in a changing climate. This research will combine greenhouse experiments, field measurements of mature forests, long-term forest plots, and remote-sensing data to quantify how trees and forests respond to multiple droughts. The research activities will be integrated with a wide array of education activities to achieve three goals: 1) develop undergraduate community-engaged learning projects for three community non-profit organizations, 2) integrate student learning projects with science engagement activities to broaden participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and 3) train undergraduate and graduate students in research activities. The project will establish an iterative and interactive engagement with land managers and the US Forest Service to improve forest management and resilience in a changing climate. <br/><br/>Climate extremes pose a fundamental threat to forest health in the coming century, but the physiological processes that govern tree responses and ecosystem fluxes remain elusive. In particular, understanding the cumulative effects of successive droughts at the tissue, tree, and ecosystem scales remains challenging due to a wide array of individual and interacting mechanisms that can either increase or decrease resilience. This project will quantify these drivers across scales from individual trees to ecosystems using a combination of greenhouse experiments, field trait and demography measurements, long-term monitoring networks, and remote-sensing data. This research will develop and discover novel information about the physiology of plant hydraulics in response to multiple drought events, accounting for variation within individual plants, populations, and species across the southwestern United States. The project will tackle the scaling of the non-linear physiological and demographic processes that mediate responses to climate extremes.

Their collection and study are fundamental for solving sustainability goals. Unfortunately, harnessing existing samples and sample-based data for future science is nearly impossible, because they are often not Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). A vast number of scientific material samples has already and continues to be collected, yet most samples remain unknown and inaccessible to researchers at large. The complex landscape of intellectual, technical, social, legal, and regulatory issues surrounding material and data sharing often results in insurmountable barriers to making them FAIR. Overcoming these barriers demands not only robust transdisciplinary infrastructure, but also community-driven metadata standards and effective data policies, combined with training and outreach to support adoption. The Sampling Nature Research Coordination Network (RCN) will maximize the natural history value chain that samples nature at field sites, labs, repositories, and museums; processes those samples for scientific analyses; and stores the resulting materials and derived data in diverse and distributed databases and repositories. <br/><br/>Through a series of thematic workshops and regular virtual events, Sampling Nature will build a community of collaborative researchers to exploit the potential of an accessible, integrated corpus of material sample data. The RCN will deliver an extensible, domain neutral, community-driven metadata standard, with recommendations for its short- and long-term governance; policy recommendations around the collection, transport, storage, preservation, and sharing of material samples; training materials covering best practices for sample identification and metadata; an innovative social media campaign to communicate the importance of material samples in science, society, and sustainability.

The project will bring transformative change to the power industry by supporting practitioners and researchers to better understand and improve power system flexibility, which is especially crucial due to the volatility and unpredictability of net loads intensified by the increasing penetration of renewable energy. The proposed work includes i) defining metrics to describe complicated flexibility information, ii) developing a unified mathematical modeling framework with various underlying modeling structures, and iii) designing broadly applicable, efficient, and scalable solution approaches for different metric or application combinations. The intellectual merits of the project include enriching the understanding of system flexibility from different perspectives, enabling the comparison of flexibility across power systems, and providing a safety and resilience enhancement direction for power system planning and operations. The broader impacts of the project include advancing the theoretical foundations in the interdisciplinary field of optimization and artificial intelligence as well as applying cutting-edge learning techniques into traditional engineering fields.<br/><br/>The study will address challenges in the existing literature by proposing innovative scientific methods in three aspects. (1) The employment of multiple flexibility metrics satisfies the needs of investigating flexibility on individual buses and the whole system, while a single metric is not able to reveal enough information on the high dimensional feasible regions of net loads. (2) The flexibility metric assessment models that involve nonlinearity, discreteness, and nonconvexity, are significantly harder to solve compared to their linear counterparts. To handle the complex cases, the project will use a wide range of modeling techniques, including mixed-integer, two-stage and multistage formulations to reduce the complexity of measuring flexibility.

This study advances knowledge about primate microbiome adaptations, which may also provide comparative data for examining adaptations in the hominin lineage and microbiome function in modern humans.

We use disinfectants and other antibiotics widely in these environments to combat disease-causing pathogens, which represent only a tiny fraction of microbial life. In spite of this diversity, antimicrobial chemicals are tested on just a handful of standard laboratory organisms. The widespread use these chemicals can lead to the spread of antibiotic resistance, making antibiotics ineffective in fighting disease. This has led to antibiotic resistance being considered one of the biggest global public health challenges. It is thus critical to understand the impacts of antimicrobial chemicals on actual indoor microbes. The goal of this CAREER project is to understand how chemicals and indoor microbes interact. This goal will be accomplished by looking at where microbe-chemical encounters happen in the and what happens to the microbes that survive these encounters. The results of this work have the potential to profoundly change the way we design and maintain indoor environments. This work is tightly integrated with outreach to engage design professionals and the public about building materials, chemicals, and indoor microbes, and more broadly increase scientific literacy on this important global health issue.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to use a multipronged approach to leverage molecular microbiology and analytical chemistry to arrive at a fundamental understanding of how chemicals and the indoor microbiome interact. The specific context in which this interaction will be evaluated is textiles. The overarching hypotheses are that 1) bioavailability of antimicrobial chemicals changes under environmental conditions and 2) exposure to antimicrobial chemicals changes bacterial community structure and function, including enrichment of antibiotic resistance. To observe how bioavailability of antimicrobials in textiles is impacted by environmental conditions, antimicrobials such as nanosilver, nanozinc, and quaternary ammonium compounds will be identified and quantified using high resolution mass spectrometry under varying conditions. To test if antimicrobials in textiles alter the microbiome, reduced-complexity communities of undomesticated built environment bacteria will be exposed to antimicrobial materials. Transcriptomic indicators and antibiotic resistance phenotypes will be measured.

Multicultural experiences can make people more creative, and diverse groups are more likely to think deeply and achieve higher quality outcomes compared to homogenous groups. In universities and in the workplace, embracing the talents and experiences of people from diverse backgrounds will be beneficial for society more broadly. Yet certain groups are underrepresented in universities and in particular fields. Specifically, Native Hawaiians are one of the most underrepresented groups in the engineering workforce and also in engineering programs at four-year institutions. As the primary public institution in Hawai?i, University of Hawai?i at M?noa serves a central role in engaging Native Hawaiians in engineering programs. Native Hawaiian engineering graduates will have numerous benefits in their future careers (including higher wages) and can have various opportunities to contribute to their local communities. In this light, it is presently important to use evidence-based approaches and seamlessly adapt preexisting practices in engineering education for supporting more Native Hawaiian students. This project will increase the participation of Native Hawaiians in engineering, with implementation via educational and mentoring initiatives and specific focus on outcomes at the graduate level. Broadening the participation of Native Hawaiians in university engineering programs will benefit the Native Hawaiian community while also strengthening the U.S. engineering workforce as a whole. <br/><br/>To support Native Hawaiian students? retention in engineering programs and pursuit of graduate degrees, we aim to provide key resources and support first at the undergraduate level. Specifically, this project will: 1) identify potential culture-specific barriers for entering graduate engineering programs through a cultural psychological approach; 2) develop course materials originating from Native Hawaiian culture for a more culturally aligned engineering education; and 3) establish multi-disciplinary programs for professional development and cohesive mentoring based on students? academic and personal needs. This project will develop culture-based pedagogical tools consistent with Native Hawaiian ways of learning and integrate them within the engineering curriculum. In addition, we will establish professional development and mentoring programs to create an environment that fosters Native Hawaiians? educational aspirations and stimulates Native Hawaiians to thrive in their future engineering careers. We expect that our evidence-based approach, combined with concrete educational and mentoring initiatives, will increase Native Hawaiian students? sense of belonging, academic performance in engineering, and interest in engineering graduate program enrollment. By increasing inclusion of Native Hawaiians, the culture of engineering programs at UHM will be transformed to enable greater diversity. The broad participation of Native Hawaiians in engineering graduate programs will further enhance diversity in a wide range of engineering job sectors. Furthermore, Native Hawaiian individuals with strong engineering backgrounds will be able to play a much-needed role in bridging a gap between policy makers and the local Native Hawaiian community to understand unique cultures and perspectives on each side.

In these contexts, individuals often turn to trusted sources, such as close relations, community leaders, and political officials, for information about risks, responsibility and how to best respond. Some of these public actors are motivated to strategically highlight certain narratives surrounding such events, which can in turn shape the risk perceptions, beliefs and responses of their constituencies. Through a series of surveys, stakeholder interviews and social media analysis, the research team examines the factors that shape how individuals are impacted by, make sense of, and respond to extreme weather and other climatic pressures; and how public officials and other elites frame these events and communicate responsibility and blame. This research contributes to interdisciplinary research and psychological, social, and political theory by considering the interactions between individuals and the broader sociopolitical context. This work has implications for communication and policy making around complex, disruptive events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other global change processes, and offers insights into how policy makers might tailor messages to different contexts and audiences. Furthermore, the research uses a longitudinal design to predict whether certain behaviors are a gateway for more costly ones, or a scaffolding for raising environmental awareness, political engagement, and social norm change. Coastal policy involves federal, regional, state, and local institutions that have overlapping responsibilities, which can lead to conflicting incentives. This work clarifies the net effect of these institutions on individuals and their responses. Finally,the researchers co-develop many of the study materials in partnership with local organizations and policy makers in order to maximize the contribution of this study to improve the welfare and livelihoods of front-line communities, and future generations. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project evaluates individual and public attributions of and responses to acute extreme weather events and climatic pressures unfolding on longer timescales, such as sea level rise. The scholars examine factors and processes that shape how individuals are impacted by, make sense of and respond to extreme weather and other climatic pressures. They ask: (A) In complex disruptive situations, how do perceived causal attributions, risk, agency, response capacity, and behavior interrelate, and how do these relationships depend on individual characteristics or experience? (B) How do social and political influences affect individual decision-making, and are they more influential when individuals are more uncertain about the cause(s) of an event? (C) How do politicians and the media shape the narratives surrounding these events, and what are the implications for individuals and society? (D) How do behaviors feed back onto attributions, perceptions, and related behaviors? These researchers use a mixed-methods approach that combines surveys, qualitative interviews, administrative data and social media data to assess multiple outcomes evaluated together for the first time. The research contributes to psychological, social, and political theory by evaluating how individuals, embedded in complex physical and sociopolitical environments, make sense of and respond to ambiguous cues using social and public information. The work also has implications for communication and policy making around disruptive events, including pandemics and the looming crisis of climate change. Political analysis provides insight into relationships between individuals and politicians, and the importance of creating structures that mandate investment in resilience and preparedness to counteract moral hazard. Coastal policy involves federal, regional, state, and local institutions that have overlapping responsibilities, which can lead to conflicting incentives. The work aims to clarify the net effect of these institutions on individuals and their responses in order to improve the welfare and livelihoods of vulnerable communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its appearance diverts the jet stream flow (altering nearby weather) and can contribute to extreme events like heat waves and droughts. Predicting blocking events is difficult. Our understanding of blocking events is poor, and complete theory for blocking still does not exist. The outcome of this project will advance our knowledge of blocking, which will enhance our capabilities to better forecast midlatitude weather extremes and project the response of blocking to climate change. In addition to training doctoral students, the project will develop (1) a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program with workshops focused on developing innovative teaching materials on climate science, and (2) a course to educate college students from non-geoscience quantitative majors about climate science.<br/><br/>Specifically, this proposal seeks to understand blocking dynamics and their spatiotemporal variability as well as their response to climate change. The research objectives are to: (1) assess the role of positive eddy-blocking feedback mechanism in blocking persistence, (2) evaluate the impact of large-scale circulation on blocking characteristics, (3) examine the impact of climate change to blocking, and (4) investigate the roles of latent heating in the previous objectives. The research approach includes an innovative use of the linear response function theory, Buckingham-pi scale analysis, and wavelet analysis in a hierarchy of models, from dry/moist two-layer quasi-geostrophic to dry/moist idealized general circulation models (GCMs) to large-ensemble simulations from fully coupled GCMs. The RET program will provide 7 research positions for high-school science teachers, who will develop introductory lessons on climate change. These lessons will be shared with 100s of science teachers through workshops and other venues and will be taught to 10000s of Houston public school students, many from the underrepresented groups. The developed class will result in novel materials for introducing climate science/research to a broad group of STEM students, strengthening efforts aimed at training a skilled future workforce in climate science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving highly efficient and low-cost photovoltaic modules is critical to make solar energy a truly viable and attractive solution for a sustainable energy future. Tandem solar cells have a much higher thermodynamic efficiency upper limit than single junction devices. Due to low-cost solution processing for both subcells, the all-perovskite tandem solar cells have enormous potential to reduce the levelized cost of energy below those of silicon based single-junction and multijunction cells. Tremendous progress has been made over the past five years to improve the efficiency of all-perovskite tandem solar cells from 10.8% to over 25%, but they have not yet reached the full potential of this technology. This project aims at increasing the equivalent efficiency of all-perovskite tandem cells to over 33% via a bifacial tandem architecture and address the related fundamental material and device challenges. The success of this project can yield a promising renewable energy source with cost competitiveness to fossil energy, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution. The project will provide training to graduate and undergraduate students through interdisciplinary research and will bring them an entrepreneur mindset. A strong focus of the project is on increasing participation of minorities and providing early exposure of research to a broad audience through several outreach activities at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. <br/><br/>The efficiency of all-perovskite tandem solar cells is primarily limited by the larger than usual open circuit voltage deficit of wide-bandgap perovskite cells and the low external-quantum-efficiency of narrow-bandgap perovskite cells. We propose to develop bifacial all-perovskite tandem cells with a damage-free deposition of transparent electrodes on tin-containing narrow-bandgap perovskite cells which have a much higher efficiency upper limit of over 33%. The bifacial tandem architecture not only enhances the upper limit of realistic power conversion efficiency, but also shifts the optimal bandgap of wide-bandgap cell to a lower value, thus avoids the large open circuit voltage deficit problem for larger bandgap perovskite cells. In addition, we will enhance light harvesting efficiency of the narrow-bandgap perovskite cells. In order to overcome the low external-quantum-efficiency issue in the narrow bandgap perovskite cells, this project will explore the fundamental processes that limit the carrier diffusion length of tin-containing narrow bandgap perovskites and address the related defects with specialized additives. Moreover, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of ground reflected albedo effects, weather conditions, and module installation conditions on the efficiency of bifacial all-perovskite tandem cells, in turn, providing valuable feedback to improve solar cell design. This research will address the fundamental understanding of bifacial all-perovskite tandem solar cells and provide a promising renewable energy with low levelized cost of energy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, we are facing unprecedented challenges in adopting sustainable agricultural management practices, increasing production, keeping agriculture profitable and coping with deadly biotic and abiotic stresses and diseases as well as changing climate that threaten yield. This project aims to transform Cyber-Physical System (CPS) capabilities in agriculture to enable farmers to respond to crop stressors with lower cost, greater agility, and significantly lower environmental impact than current practices. The objective is to make foundational advances in AI, machine learning and robotics to individual plant-level sensing, modeling and reasoning. This enables small autonomous dexterous robots instead of the heavy farm equipment to monitor plants or small plots individually and treat them with minimum amount of chemicals. This also lowers the barrier to entry for small scale farmers, increases safety, minimizes runoff as well as soil compaction.  This project includes a significant collaboration with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that is funded by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.<br/><br/>The research investigates multiple areas in data-driven estimation, control, and adaptation of complex cyber-physical systems, such as: (1) rigorous incorporation of domain knowledge and physical principles into a machine learning (ML)-driven estimation/prediction/control framework, (2) cross-modal information fusion for assimilating heterogeneous data streams that differ in type (categorical, discrete, or continuous), quality/accuracy/noise, and sampling frequency. (3) robust ML under a degraded sensing environment, (4) data-driven supervisory decision-making under resource constraints, such as data amount, data quality, privacy, and cost, (5) distributed control and coordination of autonomous teams of robots operating in harsh, changing, and uncertain field environments with partial observability, and (6) soft robotic arms and manipulators, along with embedded control and sensing systems, for agricultural manipulation by small mobile robots. The broader acceptance of the framework is facilitated by the team's unique collaboration with producer groups with direct connections to farmers. A wide range of knowledge dissemination plans target the CPS community, the farming community, and the general public. Education and outreach plans focus on the farming population and the next-generation scientific workforce. Specific activities and programs at the participating institutions are designed to broaden participation of Native American, Hispanic, African-American, and female students in computing and engineering.

Huge amounts of energy are released in the coronal solar eruptions.  A fraction of the released energy is deposited at the eruption site and in the regions of the lower solar atmosphere.  The deposited energy makes the regions appear very bright in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light and emit X-rays and less frequently gamma rays.  The sudden flashes of radiation, commonly known as EUV, X-ray, and gamma-ray flares or events, can be observed only using special detectors, because human eye is not sensitive to these wavelength bands.  Because solar eruptions occur quickly, the associated flares are also relatively short-lived.  Especially, the duration of the gamma-ray flares is typically quite short, around 10?100 seconds.  However, some gamma-ray flares are observed to last up to several hours, much longer than the concurrent EUV and X-ray flares. The purpose of this 3-year research project is to better understand how the long-duration gamma-ray emission is produced at the Sun.<br/><br/>The primary scientific objective of the project is to determine whether shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main source of high-energy protons producing the sustained gamma-ray emission (SGRE) events observed at energies >100 MeV by using combined analysis of gamma-ray, white-light, EUV and radio observations together with in-situ solar energetic particle (SEP) observations.  Observations by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi satellite have shown that SGRE events are rather common.  Interactions of >300 MeV protons with the material in the low solar atmosphere are believed to produce neutral pions, which promptly decay into the >100 MeV gamma-rays, but the source of the high-energy protons is debated.  Suggested sources include both flares and CME-driven shocks. Recent discovery of a relationship between decameter-hectometric type II radio bursts and SGRE events has provided support for CME-shock as a source of high-energy protons.  The question whether the CME-shock model is a valid description of SGRE events will be investigated by performing statistical analyses of the kinematics and spatial extent of CME-driven shocks and the properties of the associated type II radio bursts and SEP events observed during the SGRE events.  These analyses will be carried out by comparing events that seem to agree well with the CME-shock model with those that do not seem to comply with the model, and by identifying the differences in the circumstances of the eruption and the properties of the associated CMEs and shocks.  The secondary scientific objective is to determine the characteristics of the associated CMEs and SEP events, which could provide observational constraints and parameters for numerical modeling efforts of particle acceleration and transport during SGRE events.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This means simultaneously achieving economic development (blue growth), environmental sustainability, social equity and inclusion across space and time, in a context of growing demands.  Often, the needs and actions of the various sectors and stakeholders are at cross purposes to one another resulting in conflict.  This project seeks to develop and implement qualitative modeling strategies to address various ocean conflicts.  The project will investigate six case studies located in three ocean regions with diverse income levels and characterized by rapid ecological and/or social change such as ocean warming, acidification or resource exploitation, urbanization, industrial development.  The project will assess the origin, drivers, and mitigation strategies of these ocean conflicts in each case study where a different combination of social and ecological pressures together with trade-off decisions trigger ocean conflicts. Data produced from the case studies will be used for graphic visualizations that construct different narratives about the conflict that will ultimately promote long lasting equitable resource allocations and impartial transitions to achieve sustainable ocean management.  The project will benefit a broad range of local and national-level stakeholders, including local communities, government, marine planning agencies, and local and national decision-makers by increasing the knowledge base of sustainable ocean multi-use practices to help improve and foster the blue (ocean) economy while preserving ocean space and resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teacher turnover remains a persistent problem and thirty percent of new teachers move or leave the profession after their first year.  This proposal aims to increase the number of George Mason University and Virginia Community College System students who choose STEM secondary teaching careers.  It also aims to mentor them through their first year of teaching and support them to be highly effective in-service teachers to their 4th year and beyond. The project also responds to the changes in K-12 education resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Thus, the project also intends to prepare future teachers to excel in virtual, in-person, and hybrid instruction and to be highly effective teachers for students and at schools that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.<br/><br/>This project at George Mason University includes partnerships with the Virginia Community College System, Prince Williams County schools, and Fairfax County schools. Project goals include supporting and mentoring 35 prospective teachers through their major education and career transitions as future STEM secondary teachers, including their induction into teaching and initial years of service. Recruitment efforts will include working with Virginia Community College System to develop innovative programming in career development workshops, as well as leveraging a partnership with the University Career Services Industry Specialists for STEM and education sectors. A novel element of this project is that the College of Science Learning Assistant program will serve as a pool for recruitment of undergraduate STEM students into K-12 teaching. The Learning Assistant Seminar enables these students to build a basic skillset in effective teaching by learning skills in the seminar and practicing them in the classroom. Recruited potential secondary teachers in STEM, majoring in biology, chemistry, and physics, will be financially supported with scholarships in their junior and senior years. Finally, a network called, TeacherTeams, will be formed and led by successful George Mason program alumni who are teaching in high-need schools and want to support upcoming teachers. Subject areas of TeacherTeams will include Earth Science and Math/Physics/IT, Biology and Chemistry.  This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This REU Site project gives participating students experience in many aspects of machine learning, ranging from developing open source machine learning models and tools to applying them in the real world. The work carried out by the students will lead to research advances in the fields of these projects and the models and tools they develop will be open-source, leading to them being available to other fields where these models can be used to make additional advances. Machine learning  is an emerging field with limitless opportunities to design innovative services and products that will enhance the lives of billions of people, help to address emerging challenges in climate, food, water, energy, transportation, and healthcare, and advance science and engineering discoveries in ways unimaginable today. The project contributes to the development of a highly specialized workforce trained to utilize advanced machine learning methods, and to contribute to open source software. Students from diverse backgrounds and computational/data-oriented disciplines are being trained to apply machine learning and to participate in research where these tools are at the center of scientific discovery, preparing them to apply machine learning methods in other fields and providing them with the foundation and motivation to pursue advanced graduate studies. This project serves NSF's mission by promoting the progress of science and advancing national health, prosperity and welfare. <br/> <br/>The goals of this project are to train undergraduate students, focusing on those from minority serving institutions, in machine learning and open source software, where they will then apply these skills to mentor-guided research projects. This is an on-site summer program at the University of Illinois that brings to campus 10 students per year and is based on matching their preferences and interests to those of a group of mentors, so that each student works with a pair of mentors, one from the project's research area and the other with expertise in machine learning. This program increases the students' knowledge of research and graduate school, and in many cases, stimulates their interest in continuing to graduate school, while in other cases, trains students with skills that enable them to seek data science and data analysis jobs in industry, increasing diversity in these graduate programs and in industry. By their presence in the program as continuing undergraduates, when the students return to their university, they will build a relationship between Illinois and that university, their faculty, and their peers that encourages future students to participate in the program and provides the basis for future joint research projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the advent of single cell multi-omics (scMulti-seq) biotechnology, researchers can study the  biological functions of a complex biological system at the cellular resolution. The integrative  analysis of scMulti-seq data and multiple study objects produces a wealth of rich information that enables the characterization of species or tissue specific biological functions, and at the same  time, poses great challenge on how to identify and extract biologically meaningful data patterns. Though substantial amount of efforts has been made to interpret data patterns in single cell multi omics data, most of the existing methods focused on unsupervised learning in a completely data driven manner without considering the rich existing knowledge. In addition, depending on the  types of biological functions, their underlying mathematical representation forms are different in scMulti-seq data. This calls for systems biology models and machine learning concepts to target  true biological functions from scMulti-seq data. The first challenge to study biological functions  from scMulti-seq data is to derive the data patterns that correspond to true biological functions and develop proper computational models for specific biological mechanisms and pathways. The  second challenge lies in the difficulty of knowledge representation and sharing across the studies  for different species, tissue types and experimental conditions. There remains an urgent need to integrate knowledge derived from disparate data sources to optimize the biological functional  modeling, such that the learned knowledge could be utilized to study other biological systems or  data types and promote the generation of new hypotheses. The PI?s long-term career goal is to develop mathematical formulations and computational  methods to model biological functions from multi-omics data. <br/><br/>This project will develop new  mathematical models and an advanced computational framework to optimize the mining of  biological functions, by integrating scMulti-seq data with context specific and general knowledge  derived from independent data sets or experiments. The PI's research team will achieve the goals  through the following three objectives. First, a novel subspace representation model will be  developed to identify transcriptional regulation and functional gene modules. The proposed  method will be empowered by a novel local low-rank matrix detection method to detect gene co regulation modules and a meta-learning framework to optimize results interpretation. Second, the  PI's research team will develop a new graph neural network architecture to estimate cell-wise  functional activities for flux carrying networks and a graph data clustering method to identify cell  groups with varied functional states and distinct pathways. Thirdly, a knowledge graph will be  constructed to represent the biological functions derived from scMulti-seq data, which enables the  integration of independent knowledge derived from literature data and development of new  biological hypotheses. The project is expected to deliver novel computational tools that can  effectively explore biological functions from a wide range of heterogeneous datasets, and it could  provide new capabilities for functional interpretation of individual data sets by maximizing the utilization of existing scMulti-seq and literature data, and reasoning of new biological hypotheses  and mechanisms. Educationally, the scientific discoveries, including developed methods and  biological knowledge, will be seamlessly integrated into an online educational knowledge base  for large-scale public engagement, and will also lead to new project-based interdisciplinary  training for high school, undergraduate and graduate students.

Antarctic krill are small shrimp-like animals that are most abundant in that area. They are also an essential part of the marine food web of the waters surrounding Antarctica. Meanwhile, a rapidly growing international fishery has developed for krill. Understanding changes in krill populations is therefore critical both to the management of the fishery and the ability of scientists to predict changes in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. This project will have two broader societal impacts. First, the project will support the training of students for careers in oceanography. The students will be recruited from underrepresented groups in an effort to increase diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM. Second, results from this project will develop improved population models, which are essential for the effective management of the Antarctic krill fishery. In collaboration with US delegates on the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the researchers will produce a report outlining the key findings from the study.<br/><br/>Effective population modeling relies on empirical and theoretical understanding of how environment drives krill reproduction. There are two critical egg development stages in Antarctic krill that impact population growth. They are early egg development, and advanced egg development/spawning. The timing and duration of early egg development determines the number of eggs produced and the number of seasonal spawning events a female can undergo. The research team will use samples of Antarctic krill collected over the last 30 years in late winter/early spring, summer and early fall. The reproductive development stages of individual females in these samples will be assessed. These data will be modeled against climatological and oceanographic data to test three hypotheses. First, they will test if colder winter conditions correspond to early preparation for spawning. Second, they will test if favorable winter-summer conditions increase early spawning. Finally, they will test if favorable winter-summer conditions lengthen the spawning season. The study will advance current understanding of the environmental conditions that promote population increases in Antarctic krill and will fill an important gap in current knowledge of the reproductive development and output of Antarctic krill.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research to engineer and apply microphysiological systems to better understand how the nervous system regulates the gut in response to inflammation. These models have wide applications to other organs in the body and will advance knowledge in neurobiology and engineering for human health discovery. Integrated at each level of this project is education and community outreach components  to support diversity in science and engineering through hands-on, in-person, and virtual kit-based workshops, summer internships, as well as collegiate coursework and research, and annual programmatic assessment.<br/><br/>The technical difficulty of examining human neural circuits directly has limited the ability to understand neural communication in health and disease. The millions of enteric neurons innervating the gut, for example, dynamically undergo synaptic management in response to signals from the epithelium lining the gut lumen. How, when, and why peripheral neural plasticity is turned on and off, as well as which signals are transduced from the luminal space remains unknown, in part due to insufficient availability of innervated models. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award will harness a new in vitro microphysiological system (MPS) that combines human primary enteric neurons and epithelium to systematically examine cell fate, function, and plasticity in response to perturbing the epithelium. Genetic engineering with live microscopy, effluent profiling, pilot transcriptomics, histology, and statistical analysis will give insight and predictions into perturbed cell behavior compared to native tissue and non-perturbed controls to identify master regulators of enteric neural dynamics. The MPS technology can be applied broadly to other innervated organ systems and the understanding garnered of the plastic behavior of enteric neurons will facilitate the evaluation of the role of the brain-gut-axis in human health, disease progression, and therapeutic discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The premise of the workshop is that decision-making and resilience will be improved through development of a ?societal shock resilience framework? that more effectively quantifies and visualizes hazard risks, vulnerabilities, responses, and recovery paths. The goal of the workshop is to develop a potential future topic (track) of the NSF Convergence Accelerator. The workshop will identify the potential scope of the topic, the potential deliverables that could result from supporting that topic, the disciplinary expertise that could come together under a convergence research approach, and the partnerships that could be engaged across academia, industry, non-profit organizations, and government if the topic were supported.<br/><br/>Society regularly faces ?shock? events such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and earthquakes and the nation is now facing the possibility that many of these shocks may become more frequent. Existing resilience and adaptation tools are inadequate or not implemented. A key challenge are the socio-cultural-economic barriers that exist between the many groups working to improve shock resilience. A future Convergence Accelerator research track on societal shock resilience can only be realized by leveraging the collective expertise of multiple disciplines, including hazard assessment, ecologic and environmental sciences, engineering disciplines, mathematics and statistics, computer science and software engineering, sociology, psychology, economics and financial stress modeling, public health, public policy, public administration, urban planning, disaster management and emergency response. Expertise in these disciplines spans a wide range of sectors including academic institutions; local, state, and federal government entities; and for-profit and non-profit organizations in the private sector. This workshop seeks to bring together the breadth of disciplinary and sector expertise needed to define the scope of research for an NSF Convergence Accelerator track. The scope defined by the workshop will define efforts that could produce tangible deliverables in less than three years that would improve communities? resilience to a range of potential shocks. Importantly, the workshop seeks to also define a framework for any set of stakeholders to improve their community?s shock resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Classical examples are the isoperimetric problem (find the solid of minimal perimeter enclosing a given volume) and the Plateau problem (finding the surface of minimal area spanning a given boundary curve). In the last 50 years, geometric variational problems have found a number of surprising applications in both pure and applied mathematics. Their solutions can describe the equilibrium configurations of physical systems in Mathematical Physics, the behavior of black holes in General Relativity, or they can provide preferred representatives in homology and homotopy classes in Differential Topology. For solutions of geometric variational problems, the presence of singularities is unavoidable and it is linked to the physical behavior of the systems they model or to the concentration of topological obstructions in geometric problems. A fine description of the regular and singular set is of fundamental importance in our understanding of the underlying problem. This project aims to enhance our understanding of the qualitative and quantitative behavior of solutions of geometric variational problems by addressing a series of basic questions concerning their regularity and the description of their singularities. The answer to these questions will require the development of new methods and techniques, which will also be valuable in other areas of mathematics. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Despite the great amount of study dedicated to geometric variational problems, several basic questions concerning the regular and singular behavior of their solutions are still poorly understood. This project is intended to address these questions and to develop new tools and techniques to tackle them. The project involves work on four deeply interconnected directions of research: boundary regularity for mass minimizing currents, regularity of critical points of anisotropic surface tensions, regularity of solutions to spectral optimization and free boundary problems, and the structure of PDE constrained measures. Their study will require the interaction of techniques coming from different areas of mathematics, such as Partial Differential Equations (PDE), Geometric Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory, Topology, and Harmonic Analysis, as well as the introduction of new ones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Volcanic eruptions offer numerous opportunities to increase our understanding of terrestrial ecosystem formation. However, very few teams have been able to collect samples and data at early stages of volcanic substrate formation. Most studies have started their samplings years, often decades to hundreds of years after the eruption (i.e., well after the establishment of microbial communities), and only one study was able to gather data three months after the eruption. Therefore, very little is known about the initial colonists of freshly deposited volcanic rocks, particularly at high latitudes. On March 19th 2021, the new volcanic eruption near Mount Fagradalsfjall, on the Reykjanes Peninsula in Southwest Iceland, began extruding a fresh lava flow. Studying the initial colonists of the freshly deposited volcanic rock from the onset of its formation represents a unique opportunity to answer many questions about the microbial succession and community establishment of new ecosystems. This project will acquire samples and data for microbial, geochemical and physicochemical characterization of the new ecosystem formation. Considering this rare chance for an immediate sampling of a fresh lava flow, this work has the potential to transform our understanding of microbial community succession from a sterile environment to an established and resilient community. This project will also train one graduate student in field sampling and laboratory analyses. Results from this effort will be made publicly available shortly after sample and data collection. The graduate student and the investigator will give public lectures about the work. They will also coordinate with the U.S. Embassy in Iceland and Fulbright ? Iceland Commission to promote the RAPID response by U.S. researchers in Iceland.<br/><br/>The project seeks to answer fundamental questions about the initial colonists of freshly deposited volcanic rocks: 1-What is the taxonomic diversity of the earliest colonists of volcanic rocks and how does it change over time? 2-What are the potential sources of colonizers? 3-What are the metabolic capabilities of these early colonists? Being in Iceland before, during and at least 5 months after the start of the Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption, affords the investigator a rare opportunity to collect pre-, and post-eruption samples and data to answer these questions. Two hypotheses will be tested: (H1) early colonizers of the volcanic rock will be present in low abundance, low taxonomic diversity and rely on photo- and/or chemolithotrophic metabolism and (H2) the volcanic rock will harbor an increasingly complex microbial community in terms of diversity and function over time, including organoheterophs and photoautotrophs, after only a few months. The project will acquire samples and data for microbial, geochemical and physicochemical characterization of the new ecosystem formation. The new discoveries resulting from this study would set the stage for further research that will analyze the samples with sequencing and geochemical approaches and extend the study over a longer period (years). The research will provide urgently needed evidence to examine how newly formed volcanic substrates become colonized by microbial communities, looking specifically at the taxonomic identity and functional capabilities of early colonists but also at their external sources. To examine the origin of early colonists they will also collect samples from water, rock, soil and bioaerosols as part of the RAPID response. In the follow up study, they will use next-generation sequencing-based microbial source tracking to estimate the source of microbes found to occupy the newly formed lava flows. The research products will be of interest to a number of other fields outside the immediate field, specifically fields seeking a mechanistic understanding of interactions between microbial populations and their environment, and the emergent properties of the complex community. The new culture isolates will also provide information on the roles of early colonizers in elemental cycles, geobiology, and biochemistry. This project will support the travel of a graduate student to perform field work in Iceland and to process samples for return to his Institution. Results from this work will be a key focus of his Ph.D. research. Results from this effort will be disseminated through publications, public databases, and public lectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The process will be capable of producing error-free DNA fragments, each long enough to encode multiple genes, in 1-2 weeks, at a price that will be affordable even to university research labs. Researchers currently can purchase short DNA fragments that must be stitched together to make functional genes ? which is labor-intensive and sometimes impossible ? or pay vendors to do it. The ability to buy an intact group of genes on one piece of DNA will help deepen the understanding of all biological systems, from animals and plants to the bacteria and viruses that infect them. Easy access to long DNAs will also allow synthetic biologists to build completely novel biological devices, such as bacteria that manufacture vitamins or medicines, cells that detect and destroy cancer, or new sustainable food ingredients and novel biomaterials.<br/><br/>The proposed project is focused on developing an enzymatic method for DNA synthesis that will alleviate several problems inherent to chemical DNA synthesis, the only method currently available commercially. Chemical synthesis works well for short DNA fragments, but high-quality synthesis is limited to <200 bases. Longer fragments often are created by stitching together many short fragments, but this process is unreliable for sequences that contain repeats or high AT or GC content. In the proposed enzymatic DNA synthesis method, a single deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) is conjugated to the template-independent polymerase Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) by a cleavable linker. When presented with a DNA primer, the dNTP-TdT conjugate adds its tethered nucleotide and remains attached, blocking further elongation by other conjugates. Cleavage of the linker releases the TdT, to be washed away with unreacted conjugates, and exposes the oligo for extension with the next dNTP-TdT conjugate. These two steps of ?extension? and ?deprotection? are iterated to synthesize a defined sequence. The accuracy of the resulting DNA strand depends on the stability and cleavage efficiency of the linker. A variety of linkages and cleavage enzymes will be tested to yield >99.9% stability and cleavage in rapid, 30-second reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Restoring arm and hand function would greatly increase their independence.  Assistive robotics and functional electrical stimulation can potentially restore arm and hand function, but each has significant drawbacks. The objective of this project is to develop a cooperative control strategy for functional elbow and wrist movements in people with high cervical spinal cord injuries using functional electrical stimulation and a robotic exoskeleton. The results of the project will help move functional electrical stimulation and upper limb robotics from laboratory assistive technologies to wearable devices used for everyday tasks by people with full-arm paralysis.      <br/><br/>The complementary strengths of functional electrical stimulation (FES) and assistive robotics can potentially enable people with high tetraplegia to independently feed and groom themselves. FES provides free power using a person?s own muscles but cannot sufficiently control all joints simultaneously due to permanent denervation of some muscles. Assistive robots can provide additional power and control, but can be rigid, bulky, and heavy. This project's objective is to develop a cooperative control strategy that demonstrates functional elbow and wrist movements in people with high tetraplegia using a hybrid FES+rigid support robot. By maximizing the utility of muscles activated by FES, the proposed hybrid strategy will reduce the need for robot power and size, paving the way for using FES with soft wearable robotics. This project will use a rigid robot as the testbed for developing cooperative control strategies, allowing for exploration of the entire design space for future development of soft wearable exosuits coupled with FES. FES+robot assisted muscle-induced torques will be measured in real time during elbow and wrist movements. This information will feed into a coordinated FES+robot control scheme that aims to decrease robot work while maintaining tracking accuracy. Performance and robustness of the control scheme will be benchmarked for varying robot capabilities during a self-feeding task. The outcome will be a model, mapping robot capabilities to task completion success, to be used to design future wearable hybrid FES-robotic systems for upper limb movement restoration. These advances will open up new research horizons in commanding and controlling hybrid neuroprostheses that could not otherwise be achieved.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aviation and transportation agencies allocate significant time and resources each year to remove ice and snow from their paved surfaces to achieve a safe, accessible, and operational transportation network. Transportation networks experience a significant reduction in mobilization capacity due to speed reduction, delays, and in some cases complete shutdown of parts of the network due to snow and ice storms each winter.  The current practice for winter maintenance operation includes using snowplows and deicing chemicals, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and environmentally unfriendly. Implementation of the proposed technology may improve public safety, limit the use of salt and deicing chemicals, reduce delays and cancelations in the transportation system (airports, highways, etc.), reduce the slip and fall potential and the associated settlements. In addition, the proposed technology may ease the commute of individuals with disabilities in the winter season and better meet the Americans with Disabilities Act standards.  The technology is designed to be operated remotely via the internet, which further opens opportunities worldwide.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an electrically conductive concrete (ECON) heated pavement system as an alternative to conventional snow and ice removal.  The proposed technology utilizes the inherent electrical resistance of concrete to electricity flow to generate heat, maintain the pavement surface above freezing temperatures, and thus prevent snow and ice accumulation on the surface. The electricity is applied using stainless steel rebars embedded in the ECON. A fully automated control system operates the system.  The testing and performance monitoring of this technology is in progress at two full-scale demonstration projects at Des Moines International Airport and the Iowa Department of Transportation headquarters. The proposed technology may provide a smart, environmentally friendly alternative to plowing and deicing operations and may effectively mitigate snow and ice formation on paved surfaces while enhancing the sustainability and resiliency of the infrastructure network in the winter season.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hispanic and Black youth participate at twice the rate of Caucasian youth in OS programs, making OS programs promising venues for addressing inequities in STEM. Although a majority of programs offer STEM experiences, less than a third of OS STEM programming includes engineering. High-quality curricular materials can support the introduction of engineering into these environments. However, such resources need to be carefully designed to provide learning opportunities that ensure all youth can participate, contribute, and benefit. One of the most rapidly growing populations in the U.S. at the elementary level are English learners (ELs). These youth face the challenge of simultaneously learning English and academic content, such as engineering. Few, if any, engineering curricula exist for OS settings that include scaffolds for ELs and their educators. The Youth Engineering Solutions: Engineering Opportunities in Out-of-School Programs for English Learners (YES-OS) project will refine a set of equity-oriented design principles for OS engineering that are informed by strategies for ELs. It will work closely with OS educators and stakeholders to develop and study two OS engineering curricular units for youth ages 9?12. Units will feature socially engaged, real-world design challenges, engage youth in engineering practices, and provide language scaffolds. The educative materials will include youth, educator, and family-facing resources and will be designed to scale nationwide. Research will study how curricula can provide opportunities for ELs and support educators. YES-OS?s principles, resources, and research will inform asset-based models that build on youth?s experience to create more equitable educational opportunities and thus broaden participation in engineering.<br/><br/>YES-OS will investigate ways that equity-oriented OS engineering curricula provide opportunities for ELs to learn knowledge, discourses, and practices; bring their cultures, experiences, and ideas to the engineering projects; expand their repertoire of identities and interests; and enhance membership in the learning community. The project will: (1) refine, apply, study, and modify a set of equity-oriented design principles for OS engineering curricula that are informed by strategies for ELs, (2) develop, test, and revise two OS engineering units for youth in ages 9?12 that instantiate the principles using design-based research, (3) begin to examine affordances of engineering for ELs in OS programming. This will include investigating how the engineering units engage youth in disciplinary knowledge and practices, scaffold social and academic discourses, increase interest in STEM, and foster a community that supports participation and identity development, and (4) explore how equity-based engineering curricula can support OS educators as they build their knowledge of and confidence with engineering, engineering practices, and ELs and create asset-based engineering programming. YES-OS will use design-based research to systematically design curriculum while simultaneously researching the efficacy of the curriculum design and the learning environments they foster.

Immunotherapeutics, which work by engaging the immune system to tackle diseases, have demonstrated tremendous potential to cure, or improve quality-of-life of patients with cancer, autoimmunity, or other disorders. Unfortunately, only a handful of these treatments are currently available. Furthermore, immunotherapeutics are costly and unaffordable for the healthcare system and patients including the disadvantaged populations. These challenges can be attributed to the costly and inefficient therapeutic discovery processes with conventional drug screening platforms. This project aims to develop a high-throughput, single-cell based functional screening technology that can enable rapid discovery of many immunotherapeutics, specifically bispecific antibodies (?BsAbs?), to treat a broad range of debilitating diseases, and therefore can make significant and broad societal impact.  Meanwhile, the BsAb market is in its early exponential growth phase and will reach $10 billion global sales in the next few years. The proposed technology will be quickly deployed to enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients to identify their therapeutic leads with unprecedentedly rapid turnaround and high success rate (commercial value).<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to further develop, optimize and launch the first dedicated commercial platform for functional discovery of bispecific antibodies (?BsAbs?). The conventional trial-and-error approach, in which BsAbs are empirically designed and then must be evaluated individually for their functionality, is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. The proposed technology represents a new paradigm in BsAb discovery by employing an ultra-high throughput, single cell-based functional screening, enabling efficient discovery of rare functional BsAbs with differentiable properties. The objectives of this project are to develop, optimize and quality control (QC) the entire platform workflow including upstream BsAb library and reporter cell preparations, midstream droplet assay and sorting, and downstream target validation and characterization. By the conclusion of this study, a robust and streamlined system will be ready for commercial launch, enabling pharmaceutical company partners to discover new BsAb immunotherapeutics. This project will result in new tools and methods in single-cell therapeutic discovery and make significant intellectual contributions including complex cell library construction, multiplexed reporters, and potentially new therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, the unique ability to interrogate many variables in a combinatory and high throughput fashion can lead to new insights of the modes of action and inform future design of immunotherapeutics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the main limitations of hMSC production is the growth of fully functional cells in bioreactors. Treatment with interferon gamma (IFN) enhances the therapeutic potency of hMSCs but also inhibits growth. Coating hMSCs with layers of collagen (COL) and heparin (HEP) reduces the inhibition while maintaining the therapeutic enhancement, but it is unknown how the layers cause this to occur. This project will identify the specific pathways by which COL/HEP coatings enhance hMSC response to IFN. This knowledge will support the design of optimal bioreactor platforms for the manufacturing of highly therapeutic cells. Students from underrepresented populations will engage in research at the interface between engineering and biology. This will help develop a  strong and diverse biomanufacturing workforce.<br/><br/>The central hypothesis of this project is that COL/HEP coatings work synergistically with soluble IFN to modulate signaling pathways regulating proliferation and immunosuppressive properties. This hypothesis was formulated, in large part, based on preliminary data indicating that COL/HEP coatings: induce expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and reduce the anti-proliferative effect of IFN while enhancing immunomodulatory cytokine secretion. The specific objectives are: (1) To establish the relationship between the coatings and the activation of the FGF2 pathway in hMSCs, and its relation to proliferation; (2) To establish the mechanism by which IFN activates hMSCs cultured on COL/HEP coatings; and (3) To determine the extent to which COL/HEP coatings remain consistent when translated to microcarriers for suspension-based bioreactors. This project will directly impact the cell manufacturing field by merging polymeric materials with biochemical signals to produce a technology that enhances hMSCs activation and therapeutic potency.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there may be an upper limit to how many individuals can be recognized. In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigator studies a primate species with very large group sizes to examine whether male chest patch coloration may replace social knowledge of rank as a signal of male competitive ability. The project directly engages with evolutionary theories about trade-offs between social and morphological indicators of reproductive fitness, specifically advancing knowledge about the social and ecological environments that favor the evolution of costly visual signals (like chest coloration) relative to social knowledge as a means to appraise fighting ability of competitors. While conducting the proposed research, the investigator continues her involvement in local public science engagement to help foster an interest in science among young students of all backgrounds, improve science literacy in her local community, and promote open science communication to build trust between researchers and the public. <br/><br/>The colored patch on the chest of male geladas has been hypothesized to be the product of sexual selection -- a quality signal to ward off would-be rival males. This research empirically tests the relationship between the intensity of male chest color, physiology, and reproductive fitness in a wild population of geladas. The investigators first examine what might cause red chests at a mechanistic level by analyzing color-gauged photographs taken from individually-known adult males to determine if male redness is associated with testosterone levels and/or gene expression related to vascularization and blood flow in the local tissue. At a functional level, the investigators then use demographic data paired with individual male redness to determine whether redder chests are associated with a longer reproductive tenure for those males, and whether this contributes to more offspring in the long-term, as determined by paternity testing of all infants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, the meltwater discharge from the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating over the last 30 years. Both of these sources of freshwater end up in the boundary current that encircles Greenland. It is imperative to determine the ultimate fate of this water. If it gets fluxed offshore of the boundary current it could impact the large-scale global overturning circulation that helps maintain Earth?s climate. Furthermore, underneath this freshwater, the boundary current carries warm water that originated from the subtropics. This heat has been implicated in causing basal melt in Greenland?s glaciers ? which in turn would lead to more freshwater release. As such, we need to understand how the warm subtropical-origin water makes it to the glaciers. The proposed project is designed to address the pathways and fate of both the freshwater and heat carried in the boundary current along West Greenland. We will conduct a detailed shipboard survey in Baffin Bay, including measurements along some of the channels leading to west Greenland?s glacial fjords. This is made possible because the US icebreaker Healy is undertaking a rare mission to the eastern sector of the Arctic, allowing for this unique set of measurements. Two contributing studies will be undertaken by collaborators, at no cost to the project. The first will address the different sources of freshwater using chemical measurements, and the second will shed light the circulation near the fjords using a remotely operated vehicle. A post-doc and three graduate students will participate on the cruise.<br/><br/>An extensive hydrographic/velocity survey will be conducted on the USCGC Healy, from Davis Strait to the northern part of Baffin Bay, to determine the pathways and fate of heat and freshwater that are advected into the region by the West Greenland Current (WGC). The project takes advantage of the fact that Healy will be operating in the eastern Arctic in summer/fall 2021 and is available for a scientific cruise from mid-September to mid-October. A strategic set of high-resolution sections has been designed to (1) estimate the flux of freshwater from the WGC into the interior; (2) address the two-way exchange of the WGC with the fjords draining several West Greenland glaciers via deep troughs on the shelf; and (3) quantify the structure and evolution of the WGC, as well as the circulation of Baffin Bay to assess its volume, freshwater, and heat budgets. Such a survey has never been done in the study region at small enough station spacing to resolve all of the important currents, with the inclusion of direct velocity measurements, while simultaneously providing the broad coverage necessary to address basin-wide issues. We will use Healy?s conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) system, and its hullmounted acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), along with expendable CTDs to fill in gaps. Two collaborative programs will be carried out at no-cost to the project. The first will measure nutrients and oxygen isotopes to help distinguish the freshwater sources, and the second will deploy a Seaglider to map out warm water pathways and mixing near Jakobshavn glacier. A post-doc and three graduate students will participate on the cruise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ocean provides resources and ecosystem services to multiple marine sectors and stakeholders and the goal of ocean sustainability is to accomplish a fair and sustainable use of these resources and services.  This means simultaneously achieving economic development (blue growth), environmental sustainability, social equity and inclusion across space and time, in a context of growing demands.  Often, the needs and actions of the various sectors and stakeholders are at cross purposes to one another resulting in conflict.  This project seeks to develop and implement qualitative modeling strategies to address various ocean conflicts.  The project will investigate six case studies located in three ocean regions with diverse income levels and characterized by rapid ecological and/or social change such as ocean warming, acidification or resource exploitation, urbanization, industrial development.  The project will assess the origin, drivers, and mitigation strategies of these ocean conflicts in each case study where a different combination of social and ecological pressures together with trade-off decisions trigger ocean conflicts. Data produced from the case studies will be used for graphic visualizations that construct different narratives about the conflict that will ultimately promote long lasting equitable resource allocations and impartial transitions to achieve sustainable ocean management.

Three regional inter-institutional peer mentoring networks for university administrators and mid-career STEM faculty will be formed among a diverse set of primarily undergraduate institutions (public, private, rural, urban, HBCU and military institutions) in the midwestern, southeastern, and western United States. Each Regional Network will be composed of an Administrator Alliance and five discipline-specific Faculty Alliances (four to five participants per Alliance). Faculty participants will identify barriers specific to their professional advancement and will develop and pursue a strategic plan to address these obstacles and advance their careers. University administrators will evaluate existing policies and practices at their collective institutions, taking into consideration intersectional impact factors. In collaboration with faculty, administrators will strategically design and implement comprehensive campus-specific change plans that reduce barriers to equity among faculty in STEM fields, create more equitable communities, and foster the retention and advancement of a diverse STEM faculty population.<br/><br/>This project employs inter-institutional mentoring as a means of effecting systemic change through regional Alliances of diverse faculty and administrators. The project will determine the effectiveness of this regional peer mentoring model in achieving equity in STEM faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions, and will assess its impact on their professional development, productivity, job satisfaction, personal agency, collaborative activities, overall well-being, and career advancement. Furthermore, it will ascertain if Administrator Alliances, working in close association with Faculty Alliances, are an effective strategy for creating institutional policies and infrastructure that promote gender equity. In collaboration with an external evaluation team, outcomes will be assessed using participant surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Additionally, online and regional meeting observations will be conducted as well as analysis of individual and institutional metrics.

The project will bring transformative change to the power industry by supporting practitioners and researchers to better understand and improve power system flexibility, which is especially crucial due to the volatility and unpredictability of net loads intensified by the increasing penetration of renewable energy. The proposed work includes i) defining metrics to describe complicated flexibility information, ii) developing a unified mathematical modeling framework with various underlying modeling structures, and iii) designing broadly applicable, efficient, and scalable solution approaches for different metric or application combinations. The intellectual merits of the project include enriching the understanding of system flexibility from different perspectives, enabling the comparison of flexibility across power systems, and providing a safety and resilience enhancement direction for power system planning and operations. The broader impacts of the project include advancing the theoretical foundations in the interdisciplinary field of optimization and artificial intelligence as well as applying cutting-edge learning techniques into traditional engineering fields.<br/><br/>The study will address challenges in the existing literature by proposing innovative scientific methods in three aspects. (1) The employment of multiple flexibility metrics satisfies the needs of investigating flexibility on individual buses and the whole system, while a single metric is not able to reveal enough information on the high dimensional feasible regions of net loads. (2) The flexibility metric assessment models that involve nonlinearity, discreteness, and nonconvexity, are significantly harder to solve compared to their linear counterparts. To handle the complex cases, the project will use a wide range of modeling techniques, including mixed-integer, two-stage and multistage formulations to reduce the complexity of measuring flexibility.

This EArly Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) study will bring together leaders in robotics, law, emergency management, and public health with expertise in emergency management and policy to investigate robotics innovations and instances of ethical concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The result will be the first theory of responsible robotics innovation for disasters. This will transform how responders select robot technology during a disaster, ultimately saving lives, mitigating long-term environmental and health impacts, and accelerating economic recovery.  The project will provide evidence for anticipatory governance, such as new regulations and policies, to accelerate the adoption of safe, effective robots during a disaster while reducing negative consequences from either deploying unsound technology or deferring deployment of technology.

Speleothem growth may span tens of thousands of years and provide a natural archive of climatic and environmental conditions during that period. Usually, they also include minute concentrations of magnetic minerals from overlying soils, which could ultimately provide a continuous record of Earth?s magnetic field during that time interval. Precise dating of speleothems has opened up the possibility of accessing invaluable information from those magnetic records about past episodes of short-duration geomagnetic instability (for example, rapid changes in the strength or direction of Earth?s magnetic field). In turn, these instabilities may reveal critical information about the mechanism by which Earth?s magnetic field is generated (known as the geodynamo), advance investigations of possible links between geomagnetic and climatic events, and provide important data about how fluctuations in the Earth?s magnetic field strength may affect the performance of satellite communications. Retrieval of high-resolution magnetic records from speleothems has been challenging until now owing to the very weak magnetization they carry. However, latest developments in state-of-the-art magnetometry technologies and dating techniques have made it possible to conduct high-resolution analysis of past magnetic fields in recent geological history. This research project will enable outreach activities at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, support a postdoctoral researcher and part-time participation of a graduate student, provide support for an undergraduate internship targeting underrepresented minorities in STEM, facilitate undergraduate research projects, and provide hands-on experience in speleothem magnetism for twenty beginning graduate students from around the globe as part of a summer school on rock magnetism.<br/><br/>This project focuses on using speleothems, which lock in magnetizations on sub-annual timescales, to study the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion (~41 ka), one of the most important geomagnetic instabilities in the geologic record. Time-synchronous observations from the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere (Missouri, US) and the low-latitudes of the southern hemisphere (Bahia and Minas Gerais, Brazil) will provide well-dated, high-resolution paleomagnetic records that fill critical gaps in the most recent spherical harmonic models and allow examination of a time period thought to display some of the fastest geomagnetic changes of the last 100,000 years. High spatial and temporal resolutions (1-10 years) will be achieved by leveraging the continuous paleomagnetic recordings preserved in speleothems through a combination of techniques, including superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy, quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tomography, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specific goals include (1) studying short-term geomagnetic behavior using oriented speleothems known to have grown across the Laschamp excursion collected from Brazil and the United States; (2) investigating the fine-scale processes controlling acquisition of remanence in speleothems and assessing the robustness of the magnetic record obtained from such cave formations; and (3) further developing the workflow for scanning magnetometry to confidently recover full-vector records from speleothems that take maximum advantage of their annual layering. These paleomagnetic data will represent some of the highest resolution, most robustly dated records across the Laschamp excursion. They will improve the geographic coverage and geochronological rigor of future spherical harmonic models and contribute to a deeper understanding of geodynamo instability. Additionally, advanced SEM tomography and TEM-based mineralogic analyses will provide an in situ view of a subset of the magnetic minerals that retain the paleomagnetic recording in these materials, helping address unresolved questions related to the acquisition of remanence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical barrier to success is the need to couple the degrading/breaking down of the hydrogel to the synthesis of new tissue in order to maintain mechanical integrity during the transition from hydrogel to tissue. This project combines computational modeling and experimental studies to identify the underlying fundamental principles that govern tissue growth in a hydrogel. The outcomes from the project will enable hydrogel designs for a wide range of cell populations including those that have poor tissue synthesis capabilities (e.g., older adults), thus enabling a more personalized approach to tissue engineering. Planned activities include active learning modules for K-12 and undergraduate students, the involvement of these students in research, and unique training opportunities to graduate students at the interface of materials, tissue engineering, and mathematical modeling.  <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to gain fundamental insight into the mechanisms that govern tissue growth in hydrogels. A functional requirement in the process of tissue growth is a seamless transition from hydrogel to tissue that retains mechanical integrity of the three-dimensional (3D) construct. One way to maintain connectivity during the transition is through the co-existence of an interpenetrating network made of hydrogel and tissue, a concept described by the theory of mechanical percolation. To this end, this project introduces mechanical percolation into a physically-driven multiscale mathematical model to capture the mechanisms responsible for hydrogel degradation and neotissue growth. Applying an integrated experimental and computational approach, the overall research objectives for this project are to (a) demonstrate rational control over the gel-to-tissue transition at the cellular level, (b) build mesoscale heterogeneities to control the mechanical transition from gel-to-tissue, and (c) apply a model-assisted approach to designing hydrogels that achieve a seamless gel-to-tissue transition across different types of donors whose tissue synthesis capabilities vary. The knowledge gained from this research will fill a critical gap in our current understanding of tissue growth in hydrogels and will aid in the successful translation of hydrogels for use in tissue engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While they act as important players in nearly all ecosystems examined, very little is known about the true biodiversity that exists in nature. The primary goal of this project is to examine the biodiversity and genomic diversity of amoebae found in a broad variety of habitats from land to sea. The researchers will collect samples in the state of Mississippi to generate a much deeper cross-section of the group, which in turn will expand our knowledge of the environmental distribution and ecological function of the major eukaryotic amoeboid lineage, Amoebozoa. Amoebozoa resides on an important branch of the Eukaryotic Tree of Life, representing the closest relative to the lineage that contains animals and Fungi. As such, a deeper look into their evolution and biodiversity is important to better understand how microbial and multicellular eukaryotes evolved into the vast diversity we see today. This project will help train the next generation of systematists and taxonomists by providing research, teaching, and outreach opportunities for a postdoctoral scholar, as well as graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. Participation by project personnel in local public-school programs will provide education activities aimed at teaching biodiversity science to area students from a diverse community.<br/><br/>The evolutionary mechanisms that led to the great diversity we observe today in in life cycle complexity, morphology, and ecological variation amongst eukaryotic amoeboids are largely unknown. This project will take an integrative approach to researching the biodiversity of this group using detailed morphological characterizations, comparative genomics, differential transcriptomics, and environmental DNA sequencing. It will provide a much deeper taxon sampling in genome and transcriptomes than is currently available for this group, and provide a more robust phylogenetic framework through which the evolution of genomic and life history traits can be analyzed. Using unique amoebozoan-specific barcoding primers, the environmental diversity of a group that is not well represented in surveys will be addressed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are among the most promising high-energy-density electrochemical devices for future energy storage applications. However, there are intrinsic limitations that potentially lower the achievable energy density of Li-S batteries. To date, performance of this battery type has been limited by capacity loss and degradation due to permanent loss of active material (sulfur) from the electrode and from reactions of the electrode with the electrolyte. To date, developers have used excess electrolyte to dilute the side reactions that occur that result in lowered performance. This project will use combined experimental and theoretical approaches to study critical issues for high-loading and high-energy Li-S batteries. Specially designed cathode structures and electrolyte configurations will be built to analyze the effects of Li polysulfide species (LiPS) solubility on cell capacity and battery specific energy. The project will yield knowledge on the operating conditions that lead to capacity loss and degradation. The project will also integrate the research outcomes into publicly available electrochemical system simulator (ESS).  <br/><br/>The fundamental research project will focus on using combined experimental and theoretical approaches to study two critical issues for high loading and high energy Li-S batteries. The first theme includes studies of the effect of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) solubility on cell capacity. Experiments will address the creation of LiPS saturated conditions with different and well-defined initial states-of-discharge and then the characterization of Li-S cell performance under these LiPS saturated conditions. The experiments will also investigate the rate dependence of the potential reaction pathways for LiPS reduction. The second theme addresses experimental verification and theoretical modeling of solid product deposition on the cathode. Focus of this theme is on the study of the Li2S/Li2S2 deposition process using electrochemical measurement combined with material characterization methods, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The accompanying feasibility modeling of a Li-S battery will incorporate the experimental verified solid product deposition process, as well as the analysis of the LiPS solubility effect in the built model. The fundamental knowledge and outcomes of this project will also be incorporated into an Electrochemical Systems Simulator (ESS) which is a simulation package for electrochemical systems that incorporates the theoretical models into a user-friendly battery and circuit simulator. The ESS will be a unified framework, in which users can define their own electrochemical devices, discretize them on finite element grids, and perform one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) simulations to study the transport and predict charge and discharge curves and the electrochemical impedance spectra of the cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mutualists strongly influence plant growth and survival and can be particularly important for plant establishment under sub-optimal environments, however details on how mutualistic partners impact plant stress tolerance are still lacking. The project seeks to fill this gap by studying how mycorrhizal fungi (widespread obligate root-associated mutualistic fungi that provide water and nutrients to their partner plants) enable tree survival in heavy metal contaminated soils. Specifically, they will use a combination of field and experimental approaches to detect naturally occurring mycorrhizal fungal heavy metal tolerance, investigate the fungal physiological mechanisms underlying the ability to withstand high metal levels, and ultimately test the role of metal tolerant fungi in plant survival under soil contamination. Results from this research will contribute for better understanding plant biotic interactions and their role in stressful environments. The research will also allow the development of technology and tools to enhance plant establishment and productivity, as well as assist in mitigating the overall negative impacts of soil contamination. In addition, an important component of the project is to create opportunities for the participation of women and minority students in science, including mentorship for Native American and underserved students. <br/><br/>The project will thoroughly investigate the mechanisms by which natural variation in the widespread mycorrhizal fungal genus Suillus enables its pine hosts to persist in soils recently contaminated with Zn. The research will build on previous research on the genus and use controlled reciprocal transplant experiments, along with gene editing, and physiological and transcriptomics approaches. The goal is to investigate how the fungus ameliorates plant metal toxicity and allows pines to grow in toxic Zn environments. This project will make unique contributions for 1) understanding how mycorrhizal fungi persist in contaminated soils, 2) elucidating how mycorrhizal fungi protect their plant mutualists from environmental stress, 4) better predicting the effects of pollution on mutualisms, and 4) developing a framework and protocols useful for mitigating the effects of soil contamination and improving reforestation of contaminated sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One longstanding challenge is the well-known strength-ductility trade-off; the stronger a given material is, the less ductile it becomes. Grain structure refinements have been studied for conventional alloys to enhance both the strength and ductility.  To date, however, it remains unclear how grain refinements may be effectively applied to complex concentrated alloys (CCAs), which are compositionally compound with multiple principal chemical elements, made by additive manufacturing. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental investigations into additive manufacturing of CCAs. The project will perform different studies to test a hypothesis that increasing the entropy (i.e., level of disorder) in an alloy system will retard grain coarsening and stabilize microstructures, and thus, achieve both great strengths and high ductility. The research findings will bridge the knowledge gaps of microstructure engineering in designs and additively manufacturing of CCAs for high temperature and other critical applications. In concert, the formulated outreach activities will advance the research and educations in training the next generation of researchers and STEM leaders in advanced manufacturing, specifically fostering inclusions of women and minorities in manufacturing and related fields.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to understand the underlying mechanism of grain refinements in CCAs made by additive manufacturing through a mixture of dissimilar alloy powders and subsequent melting and solidifying. The project will investigate grain growth kinetics and phase stability in complex composition space, using an effective research toolkit comprised of machine-learning enhanced modeling, high-throughput fabrication experiments, as well as microstructural and material characterizations. This research will address knowledge needs related to microstructure engineering for the additive manufacturing of CCAs by exploring microstructure configurations generated from dissimilar alloy using powder-based additive manufacturing technologies (directed energy deposition and powder-bed fusion, both using a laser heat source) with following expected outcomes: (i) quantification of alloy entropy effects on process-structure-property relationships to reveal the fundamental mechanism to strengthen CCAs with refined grains or other means, (ii) microstructure formation in CCAs to understand the difference between complex concentrated vs. traditional alloys made by powder based additive manufacturing, and (iii) process-structure-property models to establish specifically for CCAs in the composition space between stainless steels and nickel-based superalloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins are the molecular machines of the cell that do all the work required to keep humans healthy, and incorporation of protein analysis is becoming increasingly important for developing a clear understanding of integrated biological systems, realizing the promise of precision medicine, and rapid drug discovery. Sample preparation is the first step in any protein-based project workflow and without a high-yield, fast, and reproducible way to prepare samples, downstream analyses are difficult to interpret and highly variable, leading to long project times and wasted resources.  The proposed innovation improves sample yields, reproducibility, and speed, accelerating research seeking to discover new therapies and diagnostics and improving cost-effectiveness.  It will also purify other important biomolecules from the same sample, such as DNA, RNA, and metabolites, allowing researchers to obtain more information from each sample, prepare multiple samples in the time it takes to prepare one, and improve reproducibility by using the same starting material. <br/><br/>The proposed project will utilize reversible protein tagging chemistry to create a one-tube workflow for the capture, wash, and elution of protein samples for analysis.  Because this novel reversible protein tagging chemistry is not dependent on a catalyst, does not produce byproducts, and is completely biorthogonal, it has the potential to work universally with all types of buffer systems, including harsh denaturants and detergents commonly used for cell lysis and protein solubilization.  This proposed work will optimize the utilization of this sample preparation technology in the most used buffer systems, model organisms, and will show superior yields in the preparation of diagnostic sample types such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.  Additionally, because our reversible protein tag does not cross react with other biomolecules, we will show that we can also use this technology to purify other important biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and metabolites.  The technology developed in this project will revolutionize how researchers prepare samples for analysis, providing them with modular tools that can purify any biomolecules they need from the same starting sample, reducing time, improving yields, and decreasing batch to batch variability by comparing within the same starting sample.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation research project examines an understudied aspect of inner ear anatomy that contributes to our sense of balance during movement. The investigator compares aspects of inner ear anatomy for humans, primates, and fossil hominins, and examines its relationship with head and neck posture and cranial anatomy. Results from this project advance our understanding of how anatomical structures associated with balance changed with the transition to bipedalism during hominin evolution and may allow for better reconstructions of postural behavior from fossil specimens. The project also contributes to medical treatment by providing insights into the potential for vestibular dysregulation in humans and creating a quantifiable and reproducible visualization of vestibular anatomy that aids precise surgical targeting and development of vestibular prostheses. During the course of the project the investigator will incorporate 3D printed models, illustrations, and animations of the results into public outreach programs in New York City designed to teach human evolutionary concepts to the public. These include programs at the American Museum of Natural History; undergraduate courses at Lehman College; and an undergraduate seminar on the use of multimedia and interactive design in science education.<br/><br/>The vestibular system consists of the semicircular canals (detecting angular acceleration) and the otolith organs (detecting linear acceleration and head tilt relative to gravity) housed within the bony vestibule of the inner ear. In contrast to considerable study of the semicircular canals in primates, the comparative functional morphology of the otolith organs is largely unknown. This knowledge gap has limited our understanding of the evolution of primate, and more specifically human, head and neck posture (head positioning and range of motion). This project uses both Micro-Computed Tomography and Synchrotron Resonance Phase Contrast Imaging to create a morphometric model of the encasing bony morphology (bony vestibule) specific to otolith organ geometry in order to investigate the evolution and functional morphology of the bony vestibule in humans, primates, and fossil hominins. The investigator examines modern human bony vestibule variation and function, consider correlations between bony vestibule morphology and head position and anatomy in a comparative primate sample, and compare modern human and reconstructed fossil hominin bony vestibule features. The research clarifies how the vestibular system and head and neck posture changed alongside one another throughout human evolution and allow future study into the way(s) bony vestibule morphology is correlated with extant primate and reconstructed hominin postural behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a strategy to control the stability, selectivity, and activity of fuel-forming molecular electrocatalysts through encapsulation in nano-containers. This project has applications in energy storage as well as any other electrocatalytic process relying on molecular catalysts.  The project lies at the interface of inorganic and analytical chemistry.

Speleothem growth may span tens of thousands of years and provide a natural archive of climatic and environmental conditions during that period. Usually, they also include minute concentrations of magnetic minerals from overlying soils, which could ultimately provide a continuous record of Earth?s magnetic field during that time interval. Precise dating of speleothems has opened up the possibility of accessing invaluable information from those magnetic records about past episodes of short-duration geomagnetic instability (for example, rapid changes in the strength or direction of Earth?s magnetic field). In turn, these instabilities may reveal critical information about the mechanism by which Earth?s magnetic field is generated (known as the geodynamo), advance investigations of possible links between geomagnetic and climatic events, and provide important data about how fluctuations in the Earth?s magnetic field strength may affect the performance of satellite communications. Retrieval of high-resolution magnetic records from speleothems has been challenging until now owing to the very weak magnetization they carry. However, latest developments in state-of-the-art magnetometry technologies and dating techniques have made it possible to conduct high-resolution analysis of past magnetic fields in recent geological history. This research project will enable outreach activities at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, support a postdoctoral researcher and part-time participation of a graduate student, provide support for an undergraduate internship targeting underrepresented minorities in STEM, facilitate undergraduate research projects, and provide hands-on experience in speleothem magnetism for twenty beginning graduate students from around the globe as part of a summer school on rock magnetism.<br/><br/>This project focuses on using speleothems, which lock in magnetizations on sub-annual timescales, to study the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion (~41 ka), one of the most important geomagnetic instabilities in the geologic record. Time-synchronous observations from the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere (Missouri, US) and the low-latitudes of the southern hemisphere (Bahia and Minas Gerais, Brazil) will provide well-dated, high-resolution paleomagnetic records that fill critical gaps in the most recent spherical harmonic models and allow examination of a time period thought to display some of the fastest geomagnetic changes of the last 100,000 years. High spatial and temporal resolutions (1-10 years) will be achieved by leveraging the continuous paleomagnetic recordings preserved in speleothems through a combination of techniques, including superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy, quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tomography, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specific goals include (1) studying short-term geomagnetic behavior using oriented speleothems known to have grown across the Laschamp excursion collected from Brazil and the United States; (2) investigating the fine-scale processes controlling acquisition of remanence in speleothems and assessing the robustness of the magnetic record obtained from such cave formations; and (3) further developing the workflow for scanning magnetometry to confidently recover full-vector records from speleothems that take maximum advantage of their annual layering. These paleomagnetic data will represent some of the highest resolution, most robustly dated records across the Laschamp excursion. They will improve the geographic coverage and geochronological rigor of future spherical harmonic models and contribute to a deeper understanding of geodynamo instability. Additionally, advanced SEM tomography and TEM-based mineralogic analyses will provide an in situ view of a subset of the magnetic minerals that retain the paleomagnetic recording in these materials, helping address unresolved questions related to the acquisition of remanence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A tree trunk or a corn stalk are mostly this form of secondary cell wall. This growth, where plants increase in mass, is distinct from the type of growth that results in changes in plant volume which is the result of changes in cell size. The rate of volume growth often changes throughout the day, where stems may elongate much more rapidly at the end of the night than any other time of day. Plants respond to daily changes in temperature and light and their circadian clocks play a role in orchestrating the timing of those rhythms. The goal of this project is to understand the environmental cues and regulatory mechanisms that control the synthesis of cell wall mass. Plant cell wall biomass is an abundant renewable resource and the cornerstone to the pulp and papers, timber and textile, and lignocellulosic biofuel industries. The knowledge gained will enable conventional breeding and biotechnology approaches to improve the production of ecologically and economically sustainable forestry and agriculture. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training in development, genetics, genomics, and biochemistry for graduate students and facilitate an internship program with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. <br/><br/>This project calls for genetic and biochemical approaches to understand the environmental conditions and the molecular mechanisms that control the timing of cell wall biosynthesis in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. Three integrated hypotheses will be pursued: (1) Secondary wall biosynthesis is a time-of-day specific behavior. Several observations support a model in grasses where the rate of cell elongation and wall thickening is inversely timed and influenced by daily changes in temperature. Rates of plant biomass accumulation, polymer precursor metabolites, and cell wall gene expression will be quantified. (2) Gene promoter sequences determine the timing of secondary cell wall gene expression. Although several specific protein-DNA interactions that regulate wall biosynthesis have been reported, the functional outcome of the presence of these sequences has on the timing of gene expression remains unknown. The specific function of these DNA sequences will be investigated in vivo with synthetic promoters and native promoters using real-time monitoring of luciferase reporters. (3) Phytochrome proteins play a role in time-of-day specific cell wall thickening. Phytochrome protein dimers are reversibly active and inactive, and the rate of that process is influenced by red/far-red light ratios and by temperature. This mechanism may play a role in the regulation of secondary cell wall gene expression and wall thickening rhythms. Wildtype B. distachyon and phytochrome mutants will be examined for the effects of red/far-red light and temperature on stem secondary wall thickness and associated gene expression.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These microplastics are persistent in the environment and will typically take hundreds of years to decompose completely. Microplastics can be transported through water, air, and through the food web following ingestion and uptake by animals and other organisms. In addition, microplastics can also absorb toxic pollutants, causing them to spread further and faster in the environment, including the world?s oceans. Although a majority of microplastics in marine environments originate from inland sources, the relative importance of microplastic pollutants released in urban storm runoff to surface waters is still poorly understood. The goal of this CAREER project is to close the critical knowledge gap on the environmental degradation of microplastics and how they facilitate the transport of heavy metals in urban stormwater. Successful completion of this research will greatly advance our understanding of microplastic sources in urban environments and how they mobilize heavy metals. Such knowledge will greatly aid the development of effective stormwater management strategies. Additional benefits to society will result from advancing scientific literacy and improving the Nation?s STEM workforce through the development of educational materials for K-12 teachers to educate their students on plastic pollution and inspire them to pursue careers in environmental engineering and science.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to utilize material science and environmental engineering interdisciplinary research to understand processes controlling the fate and transport of microplastics in urban stormwater. This will be achieved through the specific research objectives to elucidate the roles that intrinsic and extrinsic material properties play in influencing the kinetics of microplastic photodegradation and particle fragmentation, and examine how aqueous physiochemical processes impact microplastic facilitated transport of heavy metals present in stormwater. The fundamental knowledge developed in this research will provide a better conceptual understanding of the mechanisms controlling microplastics persistence and contaminant transport within the urban environment, which is crucial to estimating their negative impacts on the ecosystem and developing effective control measures and remediation strategies. This investigation represents one  of the first efforts to develop a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the physical and chemical processes that control microplastic fate and contaminant transport in stormwater. A key novelty of the proposed research addresses the mismatch between laboratory experiments that generally use virgin plastic pellets and beads by using environmentally relevant degraded secondary microplastics generated through the disintegration of larger plastic segments. This approach using microplastic fragmentation under abrasive tension will facilitate the development of dynamic models to predict microplastics disintegration under various mechanical loadings and physical conditions. The integrated educational plan will benefit society by providing professional development for K-12 educators through annual workshops to increase the recruitment of underrepresented students into environmental engineering. Additional benefits will result from dissemination of results to inform water managers, practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders in Tennessee on the presence of microplastics in stormwater, and ways to combat the problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main novelties of this project are to rectify this problem of misuse of data: the research generalizes and combines program logics for reasoning about data-usage, and the power of verification tools used in modern programming languages, within a single practical general-purpose programming language.  The project's merits are: (1) The development of a new general theory that others can use to study and adopt this new combination; (2) A new programming language, Tenli, that encompasses this new powerful combination; and (3) The design of new pedagogical materials for teaching resourceful software verification at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. A major broader impact of this work is the incorporation of a wide range of students in this project, e.g., undergraduate students from Augusta University, a research university in Georgia, Wesleyan College, a historical liberal arts women's college in Georgia, and Clark Atlanta, a private Methodist historically black university in Georgia, and the first cohort of graduate students at Augusta University.<br/><br/>This project combines two powerful verification methodologies: (1) type-based verification, and (2) data-usage tracking through graded modal types. Graded modal types are generalized to support reasoning about a wide range of data-usage tracking including reasoning about imperative data structures.  Both a new theory of graded modal types based on the notion of adjoint logics and a new practical general-purpose dependently-typed programming language, Tenli, are developed based on this new theory. Furthermore, several case studies within Tenli are being conducted to gauge its practicality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there are several contenders for the physical implementation of quantum computers, integrated photonics is advantageous for several reasons, including room temperature operation, device scalability, and long-distance connectivity using light. Despite the remarkable advances in integrated quantum photonics within the last decade, existing photonic materials and devices have drawbacks and disadvantages that inhibit further improvement in scaling and efficiency. This proposal addresses these challenges through the development of a new quantum photonic platform based on AlGaAs-on-insulator, which has desirable properties for chip-scale quantum information processing with light, including ultra-low loss components that can be directly integrated with ultra-bright quantum light sources. Through integration-driven discovery, research and development of AlGaAs-on-insulator quantum photonic devices will advance our understanding of the fundamental limits within which we can encode, process, store, and transmit quantum information. Interwoven with our research goals is a full-spectrum approach to developing new pathways for a diverse and vibrant quantum-ready workforce that spans K-8 learners and their families to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The PI and his team will establish several new outreach activities and training programs, including: a remotely accessible quantum teaching lab, which will be offered to students enrolled at UCSB and Santa Barbara City College (SBCC); a summer research internship for the cohort of students at SBCC; a short-course Saturday series to bring regional high-school students from under-represented communities on campus for an interactive quantum learning experience with media arts and technology; and a new outreach program for K-8 students and their families to learn about quantum science and engineering.<br/><br/>Technical Description: This proposal addresses the development of AlGaAs-on-insulator integrated quantum photonic devices, which has not yet been explored for quantum information science and applications, yet it has desirable properties for chip-scale quantum computing including ultra-low waveguide loss, large second- and third-order optical nonlinearities, high index contrast and tight modal confinement, negligible two-photon absorption, ultra-bright entangled-pair sources, and direct integration of active components. To establish AlGaAs-on-insulator into an ultra-efficient, high-speed quantum photonic platform for measurement-based quantum computing and quantum communications, the PI and his team will develop the essential components for programmable quantum photonic circuits, including low-loss and high-performance entangled- and squeezed-light sources, optical filters, interferometers, modulators, pulse shapers, chip-to-fiber couplers, and integrated single-photon detectors. This plan capitalizes on the PI?s expertise in integrated photonics and quantum optics, advanced quantum photonic testing capabilities in his lab, and the state-of-the-art clean room and nanofabrication facilities at UCSB. The PI and his team will develop fault-tolerant schemes and architectures for discrete- and continuous-variable quantum information processing, which may enable orders-of-magnitude improvement in processing speed and power efficiency compared to existing approaches. AlGaAs-on-insulator quantum devices will address glaring technology gaps with existing photonic platforms, filling a long-sought need for scalable, reconfigurable, and energy-efficient quantum technologies in areas of critical need. The most intriguing features of this platform?room-temperature operation, all-on-chip integration pathways, intrinsic stability and scalability, and the large optical nonlinearities and low loss at telecommunication wavelengths?will also lead to innovative technologies for high-speed interconnects, quantum photonic transceivers, and repeaters that are required to meet the increasing global demands for high-bandwidth fiber and satellite communication networks. Such technological advances will expand our nation?s global competitiveness in the rapidly evolving and growing quantum and classical information landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Speleothem growth may span tens of thousands of years and provide a natural archive of climatic and environmental conditions during that period. Usually, they also include minute concentrations of magnetic minerals from overlying soils, which could ultimately provide a continuous record of Earth?s magnetic field during that time interval. Precise dating of speleothems has opened up the possibility of accessing invaluable information from those magnetic records about past episodes of short-duration geomagnetic instability (for example, rapid changes in the strength or direction of Earth?s magnetic field). In turn, these instabilities may reveal critical information about the mechanism by which Earth?s magnetic field is generated (known as the geodynamo), advance investigations of possible links between geomagnetic and climatic events, and provide important data about how fluctuations in the Earth?s magnetic field strength may affect the performance of satellite communications. Retrieval of high-resolution magnetic records from speleothems has been challenging until now owing to the very weak magnetization they carry. However, latest developments in state-of-the-art magnetometry technologies and dating techniques have made it possible to conduct high-resolution analysis of past magnetic fields in recent geological history. This research project will enable outreach activities at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, support a postdoctoral researcher and part-time participation of a graduate student, provide support for an undergraduate internship targeting underrepresented minorities in STEM, facilitate undergraduate research projects, and provide hands-on experience in speleothem magnetism for twenty beginning graduate students from around the globe as part of a summer school on rock magnetism.<br/><br/>This project focuses on using speleothems, which lock in magnetizations on sub-annual timescales, to study the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion (~41 ka), one of the most important geomagnetic instabilities in the geologic record. Time-synchronous observations from the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere (Missouri, US) and the low-latitudes of the southern hemisphere (Bahia and Minas Gerais, Brazil) will provide well-dated, high-resolution paleomagnetic records that fill critical gaps in the most recent spherical harmonic models and allow examination of a time period thought to display some of the fastest geomagnetic changes of the last 100,000 years. High spatial and temporal resolutions (1-10 years) will be achieved by leveraging the continuous paleomagnetic recordings preserved in speleothems through a combination of techniques, including superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy, quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tomography, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specific goals include (1) studying short-term geomagnetic behavior using oriented speleothems known to have grown across the Laschamp excursion collected from Brazil and the United States; (2) investigating the fine-scale processes controlling acquisition of remanence in speleothems and assessing the robustness of the magnetic record obtained from such cave formations; and (3) further developing the workflow for scanning magnetometry to confidently recover full-vector records from speleothems that take maximum advantage of their annual layering. These paleomagnetic data will represent some of the highest resolution, most robustly dated records across the Laschamp excursion. They will improve the geographic coverage and geochronological rigor of future spherical harmonic models and contribute to a deeper understanding of geodynamo instability. Additionally, advanced SEM tomography and TEM-based mineralogic analyses will provide an in situ view of a subset of the magnetic minerals that retain the paleomagnetic recording in these materials, helping address unresolved questions related to the acquisition of remanence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its success in dampening the coronavirus pandemic rests on its ability to persuade large portions of the population to be vaccinated quickly.  Unfortunately, individuals often act in ways inconsistent with their best interests, whether in terms of voting behaviors, financial decision making, or in this case, vaccination decisions. Most communication strategies to persuade people to make better decisions involve one or more of the following: providing information that supports evidence-based decision making; employing influential spokespeople; utilizing an expanded range of formal and informal media channels; introducing fear-based messaging to promote action; and enhancing people?s capacity to make evidence-based decisions. Rarely do such communication strategies consider the strength and influence of underlying belief systems. This may be particularly relevant in those situations in which national advocacy groups have introduced counter-narratives to sway public opinion or actions. The COVID vaccination campaign offers an opportunity for examining how belief systems influence the adoption or rejection of a protective behavior. This study focuses on three aspects of belief and attitude formation: (1) the evolution of newly-formed advocacy groups and coalitions endorsing pro- or anti-vaccine stances, (2) the deployment of narratives and stories by these advocacy groups to advance their mission, and (3) the power of these narratives, stories, and beliefs to persuade individuals to accept, delay, or reject a COVID vaccine. <br/><br/>This research identifies distinctive advocacy coalitions operating at elite levels to influence local stakeholder beliefs and policies, and develops a matrix of policy and core beliefs based on content analyses of public documents. The team also identifies and characterizes the policy narratives emanating from these advocacy coalitions. Subsequently, the research samples and surveys 3,000 US residents at two points in time to capture public opinion and decision making at two moments in the vaccine development timeline. The team tests the influence of policy narratives among individuals, and analyzes the contribution of aligned policy beliefs with the vaccine behaviors of the study participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these contexts, individuals often turn to trusted sources, such as close relations, community leaders, and political officials, for information about risks, responsibility and how to best respond. Some of these public actors are motivated to strategically highlight certain narratives surrounding such events, which can in turn shape the risk perceptions, beliefs and responses of their constituencies. Through a series of surveys, stakeholder interviews and social media analysis, the research team examines the factors that shape how individuals are impacted by, make sense of, and respond to extreme weather and other climatic pressures; and how public officials and other elites frame these events and communicate responsibility and blame. This research contributes to interdisciplinary research and psychological, social, and political theory by considering the interactions between individuals and the broader sociopolitical context. This work has implications for communication and policy making around complex, disruptive events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other global change processes, and offers insights into how policy makers might tailor messages to different contexts and audiences. Furthermore, the research uses a longitudinal design to predict whether certain behaviors are a gateway for more costly ones, or a scaffolding for raising environmental awareness, political engagement, and social norm change. Coastal policy involves federal, regional, state, and local institutions that have overlapping responsibilities, which can lead to conflicting incentives. This work clarifies the net effect of these institutions on individuals and their responses. Finally,the researchers co-develop many of the study materials in partnership with local organizations and policy makers in order to maximize the contribution of this study to improve the welfare and livelihoods of front-line communities, and future generations. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project evaluates individual and public attributions of and responses to acute extreme weather events and climatic pressures unfolding on longer timescales, such as sea level rise. The scholars examine factors and processes that shape how individuals are impacted by, make sense of and respond to extreme weather and other climatic pressures. They ask: (A) In complex disruptive situations, how do perceived causal attributions, risk, agency, response capacity, and behavior interrelate, and how do these relationships depend on individual characteristics or experience? (B) How do social and political influences affect individual decision-making, and are they more influential when individuals are more uncertain about the cause(s) of an event? (C) How do politicians and the media shape the narratives surrounding these events, and what are the implications for individuals and society? (D) How do behaviors feed back onto attributions, perceptions, and related behaviors? These researchers use a mixed-methods approach that combines surveys, qualitative interviews, administrative data and social media data to assess multiple outcomes evaluated together for the first time. The research contributes to psychological, social, and political theory by evaluating how individuals, embedded in complex physical and sociopolitical environments, make sense of and respond to ambiguous cues using social and public information. The work also has implications for communication and policy making around disruptive events, including pandemics and the looming crisis of climate change. Political analysis provides insight into relationships between individuals and politicians, and the importance of creating structures that mandate investment in resilience and preparedness to counteract moral hazard.

These systems profoundly influenced population dynamics as enslaved people were transported thousands of miles from their homes and experienced restricted social life and mobility in enslavement. This doctoral dissertation project examines skeletal morphology of these enslaved people and their descendants to understand how certain biological groups formed and changed over time, explores gene flow and other evolutionary processes that may explain how the biological variation is distributed, and investigates patterns of biological relatedness that may not be reflected in historic migration data. The project supports the doctoral training of a student from an underrepresented group in science, a multi-point research collaboration, outreach with community members, and student mentoring. The project also develops curricula and seminars in collaboration with the University of Florida?s College Reach Out Program to increase postsecondary admission and completion for students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM research. <br/><br/>This project?s theoretical framework is rooted in stochastic microevolutionary expectations and diaspora studies. Microevolutionary processes such as population stratification are inferred from the premise that gene flow, rather than natural selection, is the main influence on observed biological patterns. Further, interpretations gleaned from the project derive from slave trade history, where European nations directly influenced the gene flow of the diaspora populations that formed across the Atlantic. The project asks two central questions: (1) What African and Afro-descendant diaspora groups show high biological relatedness as estimated by cranial morphology, and how do these data identify evidence of gene flow not otherwise described by historical migration data? and, (2) Given the social and legal restrictions that created physical separation among enslaved persons, do diaspora groups show stronger evidence of population stratification and genetic isolation than African groups? To investigate these questions, this project applies geometric morphometric methods to collect 3D landmarks from adult human cranial remains and uses these data to statistically analyze within-group and between-group variation in cranial morphology. Data will be collected from twenty-one sites, comprising cranial remains of 805 adult African descendants. These samples represent a variety of regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These hand-drawn maps of the solar surface have been invaluable for modern-day physicists to understand how the Sun changes over the decades.  Between 1964 and 2009, Dr. Patrick McIntosh made his own carefully constructed maps of the Sun, documenting many interesting solar features and magnetic fields.  However, since the last maps were made in 2009, McIntosh?s archive has languished and has not been updated.  The purpose of this 3-year project is to use the latest space- and ground-based images of the Sun to reproduce the McIntosh?s techniques, update the archive through today, and develop tools for current machine learning algorithms to produce these maps going into the future.<br/><br/>All solar magnetic fields are fundamentally driven by an internal dynamo.  To study this pervasive magnetic field, scientists rely on indirect measurements of visible plasma features at the surface that are produced by the evolving magnetic field.  Large-scale atmospheric features, such as filaments, active regions, sunspots, polarity boundaries, and coronal holes are distinct signatures of the ever-changing dynamo.  These visible features were captured by Dr. Patrick McIntosh from 1964 through 2009 in hand-drawn maps of the Sun.  This 3-year project aims to preserve multiple decades of accumulated specialized knowledge of the Sun, thus opening up new avenues for studies of the solar cycle by linking the McIntosh-identified solar features to modern images of the Sun through reproducing his techniques with digital tools.  The result of this effort is a new archive of solar maps to effectively extend the existing catalogue to cover solar cycle 24.  The catalogue will be open for public download and well documented for supervised machine learning tools to take advantage of this unique labeled data representing over 55 years of solar measurements.

Summer research is vital to retention of students in STEM and an important activity for students applying to graduate school. The National Summer Undergraduate Research Project (NSURP) at the University of Arizona will engage approximately 40 undergraduates in an REU program for 8 weeks during summer of 2021. NSURP is a virtual program so students will conduct research remotely (i.e., not in a wet lab setting at an institution). Students will be matched to one of many laboratories around the country, based on their interest. There is no travel required to participate in the program, and students will get the full suite of research training under the mentorship of faculty and/or scientists who have volunteered to host an undergraduate. REU participants are expected to work full time on a project they will develop with their mentor. Students will learn how research is conducted, gain professional skills, and have the opportunity to present the results of their work at a national scientific conference. NSURP will recruit underrepresented minorities in STEM, students attending Minority Serving Institutions and community colleges, and students who have been accepted to an REU but denied the program due to cancellation. The effectiveness of the program will be assessed using the online SALG URSSA tool as well as an assessment to be done by the University of Arizona College of Education. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.<br/><br/>NSURP is focused on all fields of microbiology (host-microbe interactions, environmental microbiology, physiological mechanisms, symbiosis, signaling pathways, etc.) and computational immunology.

Lead poisoning remains a major public health issue, especially in children, where the long-term cognitive and physiological consequences are long-lasting and significant. Recent research has indicated that even levels of < 5 mcg/dL have negative health effects in children, resulting in decreased academic achievement, lower IQ scores, attention-related behavior problems, antisocial behaviors, and possibly delayed puberty and decreased kidney function for children older than 12 years.  The administration of chelators, which are molecules that bind with metals to aid in their elimination, can reduce blood lead levels. However, chelation therapy is only indicated for very high blood lead levels (> 44 mcg/dL). For lower-level lead poisoning (? 44 mcg/dL), the benefits of traditional chelation therapy do not outweigh the risks of the side effects of the chelators themselves.  The proposed technology uses natural biomolecules to bind lead, which is biologically compatible and safer. In addition, the proposed safer heavy metal binders may have expanded use clinically to remove other toxic metals from the body, as well as environmentally to remove heavy metal environmental contaminants.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a chemical therapeutic to bind and remove toxic metals such as lead from the blood.  The proposed technology is a chemical combination of heavy metal binders (chelators) and large sugar molecules (polysaccharides). The proposed technology is designed to retain the metal binding efficacy of the chelator, while imparting compatibility to the chelator through the polysaccharide backbone. Initial lab results confirm that the proposed binders have substantial metal-binding capacity. In addition, cell culture and preliminary animal studies suggest that the proposed technology is both biocompatible and able to more rapidly clear toxic metals from the body as compared with unmodified chelators. Commercialization of the proposed technology may improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are used extensively to temporarily paralyze patients during surgery. Current methods of measurement have a risk of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade, where NMBAs remaining in the body after surgery. This postoperative problem can cause muscle weakness and critical respiratory episodes. The current standard Train-of-Four (TOF) monitoring method is qualitative, and anesthesiologists must depend on their eyesight and experience to judge the correct dosing of patients. The proposed device produces a quantitative output, TOF data, to help anesthesiologists gauge how much neuromuscular blockade to administer to each patient and when to reverse its effects. By ensuring complete neuromuscular recovery, the proposed device minimizes respiratory complications and the unpleasant symptom of muscle weakness caused by residual neuromuscular blocking agents in the body post-surgery. The device may prevent unwanted post-operative stress, while potentially saving money for hospitals.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a mechanomyography device that uses medical grade balloons for converting patient response to Train-of-Four (TOF) data. In the device, the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator on the ulnar nerve causes thumb twitches that apply pressure on a balloon. These pressure fluctuations are picked up by a sensor and converted into TOF data to accurately measure the level of neuromuscular blockade in the body by using pressure as the physical analog of muscle numbness and converting it into an electrical signal. The proposed device utilizes mechanomyography, which is thought to be the gold standard and most accurate technology for monitoring neuromuscular blockade, since it directly measures the motion generated as the muscle responds to the ulnar nerve stimulation. There is currently no mechanomyography device on the market to monitor neuromuscular blockade. Furthermore, the proposed device assesses the TOF count and TOF ratio even in positions where the thumb?s movement is restricted; for example, when the hands are tucked beside the body. These types of surgical positions are becoming more frequent with increased use of laparoscopic surgeries. The current technologies in assessing neuromuscular blockade are not functional in these types of surgical positions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, previous research has also shown that the nose must be large enough to take in a sufficient amount of oxygen during each breath to meet life-sustaining metabolic requirements. Accordingly, this doctoral dissertation project examines the combined effects (and possible functional trade-offs) of demands for respiratory air-conditioning and oxygen intake on the nasal complex during human evolution. By explicitly investigating climatic adaptation in nasal morphology within the context of human body size and shape, this study helps address how different anatomical systems have co-evolved in response to environmental pressures. Computed tomography (CT) scans generated for this project will be made freely available to other researchers through established online archives, substantially expanding the geographic/temporal diversity of CT scans currently available to anthropologists and the broader scientific community. This research also provides training opportunities for undergraduate and medical students (including those from under-represented groups) and the investigator will incorporate project findings into ongoing public outreach initiatives including K-12 science education programs, museum-based community engagement, public lectures, and online podcasts.<br/><br/>Despite substantial evidence that both climatic and metabolic pressures have likely influenced human nasal anatomy, the interplay of these two factors on nasal size and shape during human evolution is not fully understood. This study employs a ""whole-body"" approach by quantifying variation in cranial and post-cranial skeletal morphology in a large, geographically- and temporally-diverse sample of recent and fossil Homo. Using established equations, body mass and basal metabolic rate will then be calculated from post-cranial measurements and employed in conjunction with nasal and climatic variables to statistically assess whether: (1) nasal morphology exhibits stronger associations with metabolic demands than other aspects of the craniofacial complex; (2) climate and metabolic demands differentially influence particular aspects of nasal morphology; and (3) deviations from climatically predicated nasal morphology in fossil Homo (particularly Neanderthals) are attributable to greater energetic requirements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon may be related to the occurrence of particular co-occurring traits within a group of species that make the evolution of some adaptations more likely than others. Among primate groups that use suspensory locomotion, this pattern of movement seems to have evolved multiple times independently. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how covariation among biological traits within the forelimbs of primates affected the trajectory of their evolution. The project contributes to an emerging understanding of how covariation of traits impacts the evolution of new body plans, in particular the evolution of humans? distinct form of upright walking. In addition to training a graduate student, this project generates a large dataset that can be used to train undergraduate and high school students in study design, statistics, and computer coding. The doctoral student plans to publish short, public-oriented video abstracts of this project?s results, creating a direct link between active scientists and the public.<br/><br/>This project studies how changes in the way biological traits covary can affect the trajectory of evolution, potentially making specific adaptive suites more common in certain clades while inhibiting their evolution in other groups. The investigator plans to collect 3-dimensional data on the forelimb bones of primates from across the order, use evolutionarily informed statistics to identify traits that are associated with frequent suspensory behaviors, and examine how these traits covary in suspensory taxa and their close relatives using matrices. Different hypotheses about the evolution of suspension in primates predict different strengths and patterns of trait covariation in suspensory vs non-suspensory groups. The extent to which the common ancestors of humans, chimpanzees, and other apes were adapted for suspension is under active debate. By studying how suspension evolved in primates, this study will contribute to our understanding of early human evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project plans to incorporate some of those techniques in its design by breaking the bamboo into rectangular, dust-like particles for combination with a soy-based adhesive and PLA. The most challenging problems anticipated in this project are optimizing that glue ratio to maximize spread properties and ultimate strength, and orienting the anisotropic bamboo particles during the deposition.

The first benefit is a reduction in health disparities by improving both verbal and non-verbal communication between Limited English Proficiency (LEP) chronic pain patients and healthcare providers, resulting in greater diagnostic accuracy and improved treatment outcomes.  The second is savings in time and money as improved diagnostic accuracy can eliminate unnecessary testing and lead to more effective treatment plans over shorter timespans. The third benefit is cost-effective adaptability to other diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and cancer. CIPDAR will also add significant knowledge to pain science, as well as health communication, including management and diagnostic best practices. By including cultural norms and fluency in other languages, CIPDAR can not only re-engage disenfranchised LEP patients, but improve their trust in the healthcare system by leveraging culturally and linguistically informed content and resources. The families of chronic pain LEP patients can also use CIPDAR to not only help advocate for their loved ones, but to better understand their needs when a condition has no cure.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project, CIPDAR (Culturally Informed Pain Diagnosis and Relief), offers more than a simple translation service for Limited English Proficiency (LEP) chronic pain patients. Using a patient-centered approach, it incorporates culturally specific terms, phrases, and relevant questions to improve patient-provider communication. All features are designed and written by bilingual individuals, ensuring that patients receive accurate information that is also culturally and linguistically congruent. The technology integrates biopsychosocial interventions and techniques to better equip LEP patients with pain management tools, such as online modules that teach time management, work-family balance, and medication tracking. CIPDAR not only measures pain via patient self-reporting strategies, but also by analyzing non-verbal behaviors (e.g., gestures, movements, and facial expressions), providing multiple data streams for more informed pain assessments. By offering biopsychosocial interventions along with improved patient-provider communication, CIPDAR will address the detrimental effects of misdiagnosis, ineffective treatment, and medication misuse. It will empower LEP patients with chronic pain to advocate for themselves without having to rely on family members acting as translators or on simple, culturally-uninformed commercial translations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, changes in ocean chemistry threaten the ability of corals to build and sustain these ecological important structures. To further the understanding of how climate change impacts coral reefs, this project investigates how changes in ocean carbonate chemistry directly influence coral calcification. The researchers are conducting a series of experiments on corals grown in seawater tanks to study corals responses to seawater chemistry in a changing ocean.  Broader impacts of the project include student research opportunities, science-inquiry labs, and virtual learning. This project supports the training of several early career researchers, Ph.D. students, undergraduates, and high school students in the disciplines of chemistry, engineering, and marine ecology. Researchers partner with the Texas State Aquarium to communicate with the general public through a virtual research expedition series that will focus on coral reef health. This series includes interviews, behind the scene tours, and virtual dives on coral reefs in Hawaii.<br/><br/>This project examines the fundamental connections between seawater chemistry and coral physiology by investigating the modulation of seawater chemistry in the microenvironment surrounding corals. Specifically, this project 1) examines the response of corals to differing carbonate chemistry and 2) characterizes the proton gradient across the corals' boundary layers under differing ocean acidification conditions. Results of this work isolate whether carbonate ions or hydrogen ions have a stronger influence on calcification rates. This work utilizes a state-of-the-art experimental mesocosm facility that combines an automated systems to simultaneously and independently control both total alkalinity and carbon dioxide in the tanks to examine coral response under different carbon chemistry scenarios.

Many algebraic structures have been introduced to axiomatize this notion, starting with groups in the mid-19th century. Arguably, in each area, the mathematical tools that capture symmetry have an underlying structure that is algebraic; structures that are known as a bialgebra, a Hopf algebra, or a Hopf-type algebra. Nowadays, connections between these settings are examined through the lens of category theory that allows for the use of special structures known as monoidal categories, which have numerous applications including quantum information, quantum field theory and string theory. The main goal of the project is to study symmetries of algebra objects within monoidal categories, especially co/representation categories of Hopf-type algebras. This project will fund undergraduate research and the PI will continue their advocacy work for members of underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/>Given an object X, a symmetry of X is a property-preserving transformation from X to itself, and the collection of invertible symmetries of X forms a group: the automorphism group of X. Since then, generalizations of groups have been introduced to capture the symmetries of not only objects, but also of function algebras of objects that cannot be observed (e.g., objects in quantum physics). This move from ?classical symmetry? to ?quantum symmetry? has its origins in quantum mechanics, and arises in active research areas such as conformal field theory, low-dimensional topology, and operator algebras. In examining the various settings of symmetry of algebras beyond the framework of ""classical symmetry"", comprised of groups actions on commutative algebras, the PI will continue their work in ""quantum symmetry"" involving co/actions of bialgebras, or of Hopf algebras, on noncommutative algebras with a trivial base. The PI will also delve further into ""weak quantum symmetry"" involving co/actions of weak bialgebras, or of weak Hopf algebras, on noncommutative algebras with a non-trivial base. Moreover, the PI will examine algebras via ""categorical quantum symmetry?: This pertains to studying algebras in general monoidal categories, not necessarily in co/representation categories of (weak) bi/Hopf algebras, including several types of semisimple monoidal categories, for example, fusion categories, and modular tensor categories, both semisimple and nonsemisimple.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This mixed-method exploratory study will examine how bilingual teachers working in elementary schools in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico understand the role and skills of engineers in society. In turn, it will examine how teachers adapt existing engineering lessons so that those activities and concepts are more culturally and linguistically accessible to their students. This project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Results may also inform phage-based therapies by illuminating long-term consequences of phage administration. As the rise of antibiotic resistance threatens our ability to treat bacterial infections, interest in using bacteriophages as natural antibiotics has significantly increased. As such, this research meets the mission of the NSF in that it promotes the progress of science. This system and the multidisciplinary nature of the experimental approach is ideal for linking teaching and research. It can be effectively integrated into multiple biology courses and tailored to scale levels of technical and conceptual complexity. Interweaving elements of this project between research and teaching courses will provide novel hands-on research experiences to a large pool of biology students.

These Broader Impacts serve the NSF mission of advancing national prosperity by training students for entry into the bioeconomy work force.<br/><br/>Bacteriophages are likely to have powerful impacts on the fitness and evolution of bacterial symbionts and their host organisms. However, the intra-host location of endosymbionts may shield them from phage infection or modify infection outcomes. Despite their potential significance, few studies have explored the impact of phages on host-symbiont interactions or investigated the role of the host ecosystem in mediating symbiont-phage interactions. The goal of this project is to establish a tractable host-symbiont-phage ecosystem to interrogate the mechanisms, phenotypic outcomes, and evolutionary dynamics of these interactions. The research strategy utilizes a natural microbial symbiosis between the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and Paraburkholderia bacteria. Facultative Paraburkholderia symbionts establish intracellular infections in amoeba hosts and infection characteristics vary across symbiont strains. This project will investigate the historical impact of phages on symbiont evolution and traits by analyzing Paraburkholderia and related bacterial genomes for prophage and phage defense elements, while ongoing phage isolation from soil-based screening will illuminate relative environmental abundance and diversity of symbiont specific phages. Ultimately, Paraburkholderia infected amoeba will be exposed to phages and continuously cultured to assess the dynamics, fitness outcomes, and evolutionary trajectory of all parties by 1) quantifying population abundances and symbiont infection patterns and 2) analyzing phenotypic and genomic characteristics of evolved and ancestral isolates. Results from this system may provide fundamental insight into how these interactions play out in other symbiosis systems and on larger scales, help inform phage-based therapeutics, and be of relevance to microbial ecology, virology, evolutionary biology, and bacterial pathogenesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

IceCube will remain a unique tool for the delivery of the neutrino component of multimessenger astrophysics as well as a broad range of neutrino and cosmic ray science. The ICNO has set limits on Dark Matter annihilation, made precision measurements of the angular distribution of cosmic ray muons, and characterized in detail physical properties of the Antarctic 2.6-km thick ice sheet at South Pole. The discovery of high-energy cosmic neutrinos by IceCube with a flux at the level anticipated for those associated with high-energy gamma- and cosmic-ray accelerators brightens the prospect for identifying the sources of the highest energy particles.

The focal study organism in the plankton is a shelled mollusk, the Antarctic pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica, an Southern Ocean organism that this known to respond to climate driven changes in ocean acidification and ocean warming.  Ocean acidification, the lowering of ocean pH via the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the surface of the ocean, is a change in the ocean that is expected to cross deleterious thresholds of pH within decades. This study will improve understanding of how pteropods will respond, which will provide insight into predicting the resilience of the Antarctic marine ecosystem during future changes, one of the planet?s last marine wildernesses. The project will use tools of molecular biology to examine specifically how gene expression is modulated in the pteropods, and further, how the changes and regulation of genes act to resist the stress of low pH and high temperature.

The project will investigate changes in the epigenome of juvenile L. h. antarctica, by assessing the dynamics of DNA methylation in response to three scenarios of environmental conditions that were simulated in laboratory mesocosm CO2 experiments: (1) present-day pCO2 conditions for summer and winter, (2) future ocean acidification expected within 10-15 years, and (3) a multiple stressor experiment to investigate synergistic interaction of OA and high temperature stress.  Recent lab-based mesocosm experiment research showed significant changes in the dynamics of global DNA methylation in the pteropod genome, along with variation in gene expression in response to abiotic changes. Thus, it is clear that juvenile L. h. antarctica are capable of mounting a substantial epigenetic response to ocean acidification.  However, it is not known how DNA methylation, as an epigenetic process, is modulating changes in the transcriptome.  In order to address this gap in the epigenetic knowledge regarding pteropods, the project will use next-generation sequencing approaches (e.g., RNA sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) to integrate changes in methylation status with changes in gene expression in juvenile pteropods.  Overall, this investigation is an important step in exploring environmental transcriptomics and phenotypic plasticity of an ecologically important member of Southern Ocean macrozoooplankton in response to anthropogenic climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much research has focused on climate changes associated with stratospheric aerosol climate intervention (also called stratospheric aerosol geoengineering ? SAG), but only a few studies have addressed its potential societal impacts, in particular global agricultural productivity. This project will examine how anticipated climate changes from SAG, compared with the present and a future without SAG, would interact with the global agriculture system, influence crop growth, and impact world food production. Spatially explicit climate changes considered here associated with SAG include less total solar radiation, more diffuse solar radiation, reduced surface temperature, changed precipitation, changed surface ozone concentration, and different global mean CO2 levels.<br/><br/>This project is a multidisciplinary collaboration to evaluate global agriculture impacts of SAG with an integrated assessment framework, including a state-of-the-art Earth System Model linked to multiple mechanistic crop models. These models are targeted to advance the frontier of process-based crop modeling with representations of ozone damage and diffuse radiation in photosynthesis processes. Impact uncertainties will be systematically quantified through the model ensemble setup and multi-crop model assessment, and by using different downscaling methods for climate forcing data. Detailed impacts of individual climate factors on crop yields will be studied, while considering feedbacks from the agriculture system to the anticipated SAG climate impacts. The results of this project will provide new quantitative evidence of SAG implications for world food production in view of present day and potential future climates without SAG. The project will foster communication between the climate modeling community (including the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project) and the crop modeling community (the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project), to advance understanding of agricultural impacts under global warming and a future climate with stratospheric aerosol intervention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumers lack an understanding of their skin properties and needs, as well as knowledge around the biochemical basis for the use of a particular product or ingredient. As a result, they spend money and time trying new products and seek professional assistance in managing their skin. This project has the potential to bring robust scientific information to the skincare industry, a sector that is largely unregulated, which may result in an increase of consumer confidence in the beneficial use of their skincare products. Both direct-to-consumer and professional markets can be transformed by this technology, owing to its ability to enable commercial opportunities that will increase the overall health and wellness of individuals through self-testing. This self-testing will drive skincare product manufacturers to formulate high-quality products with ingredient transparency (including product analysis and ingredient quality control) and will create competition in the home testing market. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on a skin phenotype assessment technology to empower consumers to make informed choices about skincare products. Specifically, mass spectrometry (MS)-based molecular omics analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) are used to determine ideal facial skincare products and/or ingredients for an individual's unique skin. The state-of-the-art MS analysis illuminates the composition of skin cells at the molecular level (e.g., amino acids, ceramides). The molecular composition can be used to characterize skin health (e.g., structure, function, environmental exposures, and hydration). The product-skin fit AI matches the needs of the individual's skin to existing products based on the biological functions of active and common ingredients in skincare products. Through prior work in animal models, 5,240 skin analytes were detected and > 50 different lipid and metabolite classes identified. These molecularly-diverse metabolites and lipids highlight the depth of biological information contained in skin cells.

The technology may improve caregivers? experiences by providing tailored information that helps connect them with the community of support services appropriate for them. The aim of this technology is to increase caregiver confidence and utilization of community and remote resources available to them. Numerous resources for family caregivers have been developed previously. However, the adoption rate of these resources remains low due to lack of easy access, non-personalized information, information complexity, and a poor user experience.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel Care Personalization Algorithm (CPA) that creates a user-specific intervention best suited for each caregiver.

The proposed technology addresses this issue by developing a digital platform based on logic decision trees (based on key caregiver characteristics input by the user) and geolocation (automatically obtained from the mobile phone).  The technology will generate personalized information, recommendations, and interactive checklists for each caregiver to assist with the legal, financial, health, social assistance and other challenges of caregiving.

One of the major reasons for these increased demands is the generation of non-utilized waste streams. The U.S. generates approximately 254 million tons of trash each year, with only 34% of this waste recycled or composted.  Increasing restrictions on the export of garbage has generated both challenges and opportunities for the management of waste systems. Waste material provides and opportunity for materials recovery, the generation of new products and processes, and the potential to positively impact food, energy, and water systems.  Given the increasing rates of consumption internationally, developing the next generation of waste recovery is of global significance.  However, reinventing waste streams requires a better understanding of how waste is currently governed, rethinking and redesigning waste recovery production systems to better capture the value of material, developing systems for monitoring material composition, integration with new cyber infrastructure for waste monitoring, and incorporating the behavioral and policy structures that influence action across complex multi-scaled systems.  The objectives of the project are to develop a systems-level framework for comparative analysis of organic waste lifecycles that combines behavior sciences with material flows analysis to rethink waste systems and the development of new co-products from organic wastes. <br/><br/>This proposal focuses on systems-level interactions in the framework of ""Organic Waste Lifecycles at the Interface of Food, Energy and Water Systems (OWL-FEWs)."" The project entails the development of the next generation of cyber-infrastructure for measuring, monitoring, and capturing data on organic waste streams; analysis of social and institutional drivers behind organic waste disposal behavior; and experimentation, development, and testing of new co-products from organic waste streams. Utilizing an existing pilot-scale anaerobic digester, bio/hydrochar engineering facilities, open source radio frequency identification tagging for real time tracking of waste flows, and a series of behavior experiments and comparative institutional analysis of human behavior, the research team will focus on five goals: 1) The development of a dynamic model of organic waste lifecycles at a regional level; 2) The development and testing of organic food waste co-products for energy, soil amendments, water remediation, and other uses; 3) The development of a smart organic food waste cyber infrastructure; 4) The integration of social sciences across the development of the dynamic model, cyberinfrastructure, and waste/resource products; and 5) The engagement of stakeholders across the research and educational efforts.

Syneruptive magma decompression rate is thought to be a dominant control on volcanic eruptive style, due in part to its role in modulating the dynamics of bubble formation and migration. In recent years, techniques have been developed that use chemical gradients in rapidly quenched volcanic tephra to constrain magma decompression rates; however, the rarity of suitable samples for the application of these techniques has severely limited the acquisition of statistically robust datasets that could be used to explore temporal variations in magma decompression rate over the course of a single eruption. A newly developed magma decompression ?clock? that exploits water concentration gradients in prevalent olivine crystals can now be used to overcome this limitation. We propose to apply this new magma decompression clock to study temporal variations in the decompression rate of magma erupted at Cinder Cone, Lassen Volcanic National Park, CA. The exceptionally well-preserved tephra sequence from Cinder Cone captures a transition in eruptive style from Hawaiian/Strombolian to Strombolian/Violent Strombolian, providing an excellent natural laboratory for studying the role of decompression rate as a control on eruptive style. The Lassen region is one of the most active volcanic regions in the US and poses a significant hazard to Californians, National Park visitors, and flights to and from the busy San Francisco Bay Area. The results of the proposed work will be shared with the California Volcano Observatory, the Cascade Volcano Observatory, and Lassen Volcanic National Park, which manage volcano-monitoring infrastructure and volcanic hazard mitigation efforts in California.<br/><br/>In the proposed work, variations in magma decompression rate will be studied in the context of syneruptive temperature changes and textural variations in the 1666 C.E. Cinder Cone eruptive deposit. We will apply three independent techniques to estimate magma decompression rates: (1) water-in-olivine diffusion chronometry; (2) bubble number density; and (3) microlite number density. Additionally, we will constrain magma cooling rates using MgO zonation in olivine-hosted melt inclusions. We will build a statistically robust dataset of decompression rate and cooling rate estimates that will be used to assess (for the first time in a basaltic system) temporally resolved variations in decompression rate and cooling rate across a transition in eruptive style. This approach will allow the evolution of pressure-temperature- time conditions in the conduit just prior to eruption to be studied in unprecedented detail, thereby increasing our understanding of the controls on the explosivity of basaltic volcanic eruptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main objective of this proposal is to develop and test a mathematical theory for riverbank erosion in permafrost. The theory will be tested using novel indoor permafrost-river experiments at the Caltech Earth Surface Dynamics Laboratory, and through measurements along the Koyukuk River, AK, in collaboration with the Native Alaskan community of Huslia. The work promises to fill a gap in our basic understanding of how river systems respond to global warming. In addition, it will contribute to climate-change adaptation planning for riverside communities in the Yukon River watershed. The next generation of scientists will be trained at the undergraduate and PhD levels in integrated hazard assessment by bringing together community engagement and basic and applied science to address an environmental crisis with both local and global implications. <br/><br/>The main objective of this proposal is to develop and test a thermo-mechanical model for river-bank erosion in permafrost.

The model will be tested against flume experiments specially designed to span the range of permafrost river characteristics and to test hypotheses related to river flow velocity, river water temperature, and bank sediment grain size. Measurements of hydraulic, mechanical and thermal properties of cutbanks along the Koyukuk River, Alaska, will be used to evaluate the model for entrainment- and ablation-limited regimes.

Ewbank-Popescu (University of St. Thomas) for research conducted with graduate and undergraduate students.  Research activities ranging from molecular biology to spectroscopy seek to understand the molecular mechanism by which the protein Fur regulates iron content inside bacteria.  Iron is an essential element for all living organisms.  However, iron overload can cause dangerous oxidative damage to cells under aerobic conditions.  Thus, tight regulation of the iron content is essential for cells to grow.  In bacteria, the Ferric Uptake Regulator (Fur) is a global iron regulator.  When iron content is too high, Fur becomes a transcription repressor to block formation of the iron transporters and prevent accumulation of excess iron in cells.  However, the mechanism by which Fur senses the intracellular iron content remains largely elusive.  This project is based on preliminary studies showing that in the bacterium  E coli, Fur can bind a cluster of Iron bound to Sulfur when the intracellular iron content is high.  The goal of the project is to determine how Fur may undergo the binding of this [2Fe-2S]-cluster in response to changes of the intracellular iron concentration and in turn regulate the expression of the genes related to iron metabolism in bacteria. This project will provide greater understanding of how bacteria, including infective bacteria in our tissues, can pull iron essential for growth from inside animal and plant cells, to be used instead for bacterial growth.  This will inform our knowledge of the interactions of bacteria with larger creatures in the ecosystem, agriculture, and health. The project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in vigorous and exciting interdisciplinary research activities.<br/><br/>The ferric iron regulator (Fur) is a highly conserved global iron regulator in bacteria. The current hypothesis states that when the intracellular ?free? iron content is elevated, Fur binds ferrous iron to form an ?iron-bound? Fur and regulates the intracellular iron homeostasis by controlling the expression of specific genes.  However, the ?iron-bound? Fur has never been isolated from any bacteria.  Preliminary studies revealed that the Escherichia coli Fur can bind a [2Fe-2S] cluster via the conserved cysteine residues in the E. coli mutant cells in which the intracellular iron content is elevated.  The goal of this project is to test a hypothesis that Fur regulates the intracellular iron homeostasis via reversible binding of a [2Fe-2S] cluster.  Aim 1 is to determine the redox properties and stability of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in Fur by combining biochemical and spectroscopic (including UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Mössbauer spectroscopy) approaches. Aim 2 is to investigate the physiological function of the [2Fe-2S] cluster-bound Fur by analyzing its specific DNA binding activity in vitro and the gene expression profile regulated by the [2Fe-2S] cluster-bound Fur in E. coli cells.  Aim 3 is to explore the conserved nature of the [2Fe-2S] cluster binding in Fur proteins from other bacteria.  Because Fur is highly conserved among bacteria, success of the project is expected to illustrate a novel mechanism by which Fur regulates the intracellular iron homeostasis in E. coli and other bacteria via an iron-sulfur cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particulate (micron scale) calcium carbonate has a number of industrial uses in the manufacture of paper, thermoplastics, sealants and adhesives, and paints. Currently, the production of PCCs requires sintering (heating to >1,000°C), which releases an estimated 162 kilotons of carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere annually. The anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases represents a significant threat to our planet, with climate impacts that will disrupt societies and damage important ecosystem services. The proposed microbial processes by-passes sintering and sequesters CO2 in the production of PCCs.  This technology represents a novel target to reduce CO2 emissions, while carbon capture credits may increase profit margins in a market that is worth $5.6 billion annually. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a microbial metabolic pathway that uses cellular calcium cations (Ca2+) homeostasis to initiate the precipitation of micron-scale carbonates sourced from atmospheric CO2. By understanding the metabolic pathways and genetic controls that regulate this process, it has been possible to tune the microbial cultures to produce a variety of PCCs, including PCCs that cannot be made using existing technologies. As the carbonates produced in this system are sourced from atmospheric CO2, not only does this represent a green solution to PCC production, but it also has the potential to be a previously unidentified mechanism of carbon-capture. In addition, the proposed technology is unique within current microbially-precipitated calcium carbonate technologies in that mined limestone is not required; nor is bacterial ureolysis utilized. Instead, the source of the carbonates in the PCCs produced using the proposed method is atmospheric CO2 with net carbon capture. By varying the chemical conditions for growth, it may be possible to generate PCCs with a variety of characteristics (particle size, particle shape, surface chemistry, and surface area) that are important in many industrial applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deployable structures are used in several areas pertaining to robotics (e.g., soft robots used in minimally invasive surgeries and in search-and-rescue), to aeronautics and astronautics (e.g., smart airfoils, deployable mirrors and solar panels and sails in space missions) and to smart structures (e.g., deployable shelters and rooftops). The relationships that exist between the global behavior of a deployable structure and the local behavior of its elementary constituents (bars, plates and membranes) are governed by a mixture of geometrical and mechanical laws. The research aims to establish a fundamental understanding of such local-to-global relationships and of the way they dictate how a deployable structure changes shape under external loads so as to improve current modeling, design and control paradigms. The theme of geometry provides aesthetic and appealing connections with several areas of artistic and fashion design and will be leveraged to increase public engagement with science and technology through outreach activities which, with the help of an institutional center, will particularly target K-12 and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The main purpose of the project is to initiate a theory of the finite, geometrically non-linear, elastic deformations of deployable structures that are tailored on small space scales as in architected materials and metamaterials. The technical objectives of the research efforts are to (i) characterize the macroscopic deformation paths compatible with the small-scale kinematics of a deployable structure composed of rigid or inextensible elements; to (ii) compute the generalized, strain-gradient or enriched, elasticity functionals that govern the equilibrium geometries of a deployable structure and particularly so in cases where standard Strength of Materials theories break down; (iii) formulate conceptual control problems and solve them for actuation parameters understood as the boundary data that deform the deployable structure into a target shape; and (iv) establish inverse design paradigms that allow us to find deployable structures with pre-programmed deformation paths. To do so, the project will develop analysis methods marrying differential geometry, asymptotics and homogenization theory.

The technology will help improve properties such as water resistance, adhesion, surface hardness, and film formation. The project is not limited to waterborne architectural coatings. It may also be applied to other coating systems, including coatings for automobiles, inks for printing, cosmetics for personal care products, and functional coatings for medical appliances. The technology can potentially increase the performance and lifetime for coatings that play a critical role in protecting various surfaces from aging or deteriorating. In addition, this effort represents a platform technology that offers a unique way to control surface properties, which may enable new designs for functional coatings, including self-cleaning and anti-bacterial coatings. The use of these new coatings may, in turn, reduce the pollution to the environment and reduce energy costs.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on a new way of creating self-stratified coatings using amphiphilic Janus particles, where one side of the particle can resist water and the other side can be highly adhesive. Upon drying, Janus particles vigorously accumulate at the air-water interface with fast kinetics.  Their hydrophobic sides orient towards the air to enhance the water-repellency while the hydrophilic sides sustain strong adhesion with the underlying layer. This proposal explores the potential commercialization and market of such technology for creating water-resistant coatings and the broad applications of the newly developed self-stratification system. It provides potential improvements in surface properties by directly adding Janus particles without redesigning the original coating chemistries.

The absence of stable accommodations increases the risks of poor outcomes for all members of the household, including children, experiencing this insecurity. This project is an exploratory study in the use of techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) to improve early screening and the delivery of targeted assistance to households that are at risk of future homelessness and child maltreatment. The team will seek to develop novel methods for allocation of scarce housing-support resources to at-risk households, taking into account considerations of both overall efficiency and fairness. This work will necessitate novel problem formulation and algorithm development in AI as well as creating new ethical methods for deciding on how to effectively deliver social services taking into account the vast complexity of human behavior. Moreover, reducing the risks of homelessness and child maltreatment are critical societal goals with the potential to substantively improve the lives of many of our most vulnerable citizens.<br/><br/>This project will explore the feasibility of using novel algorithmic techniques to inform societal decision-making on the allocation of scarce resources, with the specific goal of improving service system outcomes for both homelessness and child welfare. The team's focus will be on homelessness prevention interventions that offer timely, non-reoccurring resources to stabilize families at risk of experiencing housing crises; examples of such resources include landlord mediation, one-time rent or utility payments, and moving expenses. They will leverage unique datasets on child welfare and homelessness in the research, and use these to inform the design of machine learning approaches to prediction of outcomes (specifically, repeat episodes of homelessness and future interactions with child protective services), and optimization techniques that leverage these predictions in order to decide on which households to target for prevention interventions. The interplay of prediction and optimization, in a context where the overall allocation must both improve social welfare (measured along multiple dimensions) and satisfy notions of  fairness, equity, and local justice in the allocation of scarce resources, is a challenging domain for AI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An affordable yet highly accurate gyroscope will open a $10 B market opportunity in autonomous systems applications, and it will provide disruptive, more compact new technology into the $2 B existing high-performance inertial navigation market.  Possible market applications include sensors for consumer electronics, automotive safety systems, industrial robots, and national security systems.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new 3-D Silicon Nitride bandgap waveguide to enable small, high-precision integrated optical gyroscopes.  Traditionally, on-chip Silicon Nitride waveguides are short centimeter length structures with optical loss on the order of a 100 dB per meter making them unsuitable to fabricate long gyroscope waveguides.  Gyroscope waveguides typically require a spiraled sensing waveguide greater than 40 meters long to generate the sufficient Sagnac Phase for performant operation.  Additionally, there is a trade-off between tight pitch waveguides that fit more sensing area per die, and the errors generated from optical phase coupling between neighboring waveguide spiral tracks.  This SBIR will demonstrate a novel 3-D bandgap structure and process methodology to densely pack an ultra-low loss waveguide that will enable an approximate 400x improvement in optical loss and a 4x improvement in waveguide density versus conventional Silicon Nitride waveguide approaches found in today?s standard CMOS process.

Because Livingstone College has a high proportion of students from populations that are underrepresented in STEM, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM. It also has the potential to inform other colleges and universities about how mentoring and formalized training in undergraduate research and entrepreneurship may improve retention and graduation of students from low-income backgrounds.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  There are four specific aims: (1) enhance educational, research, and entrepreneurship opportunities for students; (2) attract, recruit, retain and graduate talented STEM students; (3) enhance preparation of students for STEM graduate school and the STEM workforce; and (4) advance student development through work-based learning and entrepreneurship experiences.  To help students develop psychosocial constructs associated with persistence, such as self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and personal goal setting, the project plans to build upon prior NSF-funded research at Livingstone College on the use of Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) as a conceptual framework for supporting student success. SCCT has been shown to be useful in predicting the math/science interests and goals of diverse groups of secondary students. This project plans to further understand how SCCT may facilitate baccalaureate retention, graduation, and STEM career preparation among post-secondary students from communities that are underrepresented in STEM. The project will deliver faculty professional development in pedagogical and curricular practices associated with SCCT, with a focus on fostering development of the identified constructs (e.g., self-efficacy) in participating students. The project will be evaluated using a mixed methods approach that includes validated instruments, qualitative interviews and analyses, syllabi improvement evaluation protocol, participation metrics, and retention/ graduation rates for evaluating both formative and summative outcomes. Results of the project will be made available through an established network of STEM educators, as well as through journal articles and conference presentations. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed technology may be used for high-volume production with a wide range of engineering materials at a cost competitive with traditional manufacturing. This may have a transformative impact on the manufacturing industry by facilitating the transition to fully digital manufacturing, enabling mass customization, and transforming how products are made and consumed. While the proposed MAPS technology potentially may impact many different industries (e.g., printed electronics, 3D printing) due to its significant advantages in energy consumption, equipment cost, manufacturing time, and process control, the initial focus is on the potential of MAPS for rapid prototyping and small volume production of plastic parts. Compared to other existing solutions in the market (e.g., selective laser sintering), MAPS may better serve the market needs in several areas including feedback control of the printing process for better part quality, higher printing speed, and lower cost of equipment and ownership. This may reduce the barrier of adopting additive manufacturing and accelerate the transition to digital manufacturing.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a Microheater Array Powder Sintering (MAPS) technology for additive manufacturing.  The proposed technology uses a microheater array to digitally deliver a focused heat pattern and selectively sinter powder particles by placing the microheater array in close proximity to the powder surface. Compared to selective laser sintering (SLS) that uses a laser to fuse powder particles with point-wise scanning, MAPS uses an microheater array that may include thousands of microheater elements for line-wise or layer-wise printing.  These printing processes enable significantly higher printing speeds. In contrast to high-cost lasers, a microheater array is an array of tiny thin-film resistors that may be fabricated at relatively low-cost using MEMS fabrication techniques. In addition, MAPS has much lower power consumption. Compared to a laser that typically requires 10s or 100s of watts of power for SLS, each microheater typically consumes 100s of milliwatts of power to achieve similar results. Moreover, MAPS enables easy feedback control. In contrast to a laser that delivers energy in an open-loop fashion without knowing the temperature, a microheater is also a temperature sensor, which allows for precise temperature control and enables feedback process control.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though some species are excluded by human impacts on the environment, many species of wildlife readily modify their behavior to cope with changes such as urbanization. Studying the neural and physiological mechanisms that permit some species to adjust to environmental change addresses the fundamental scientific question of how behavioral flexibility is achieved. Additionally, understanding how species adjust to different aspects of environmental change can inform conservation and management efforts. The proposed work will take advantage of an increase in human recreation in parks in Montgomery County, VA that has been driven by the COVID-19 quarantine to both compare the effects of human presence relative to those of the built environment, and identify brain mechanisms that regulate behavioral adjustments to environmental change in a common song bird, the song sparrow. By working with a local land trust to educate the community about our research this work will benefit the birders and walkers using the park, as well as provide insight into the conservation of wild songbirds.<br/><br/>Human-induced rapid environmental change is a threat to biodiversity and especially songbirds. While some species are in decline because of impacts such as urbanization, others have traits that allow them to cope with changing conditions. Behavioral plasticity is critical for the persistence of species and individuals in the face of rapid environmental change, yet we do not fully understand the mechanisms underlying such flexibility. Moreover, though distinguishing the effects of different types of anthropogenic change is critical for conservation, we do not understand their consequences for wildlife. The proposed work capitalizes on a temporary increase in outdoor recreation in rural environments during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine how increased human presence impacts the behavior and underlying brain mechanisms in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Much of what we know about the effects of anthropogenic change on wildlife comes from studies of urbanization. Wild animals living in urban habitats are more aggressive than rural counterparts but the mechanisms regulating these differences remain unclear. Our research group demonstrated that increased territorial aggression in male song sparrows living at our long-term urban study sites is associated with differences in the function of the arginine vasotocin (AVT) system. Therefore, to characterize the contribution of the AVT system to behavioral plasticity in response to anthropogenic change we will compare brain and behavioral measures from adult birds (Aim 1) and hatch-year birds (Aim 2) living in replicate urban habitats, rural habitats with low human presence, and rural habitats with temporary increases in human presence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of disease is a critical problem that causes many patients to endure unnecessary side effects, such as infections from biopsies and high healthcare costs. The proposed approach may offer a critically needed innovation that will overcome multiple barriers facing existing kinase assays and better equip clinicians and pharmaceutical scientists in the treatment and development of next generation therapies.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will address drawbacks of current kinase activity assays. The goal of this project is to develop highly sensitive and multiplexed kinase assays using an innovative DNA-based protein activity detection system. DNA-based activity assays display multiple advantages over current assays, including cost effectiveness, multiplexing ability, high sensitivity, and specificity. This assay will be 10- to 100-fold cheaper than current assays due to the low cost of DNA synthesis. The proposed approach enables the detection of protein activities as low as 100 femtomolar (fM) in proteins in clinically-relevant biological samples. Ultimately, this innovative DNA-based kinase assay platform will address the limitations facing current kinase assay systems with a new solution that offers high specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy in terms of disease diagnostics and/or monitoring the kinase targeted drug responsiveness of various cancers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even though clinical end-users and health care systems operate at highly informed levels, there are still major healthcare disparities in quality of care across all specialties and health care industries. The proposed technology provides a quantifiable monitoring tool to removing bias and subjective assessments and make respiration assessment more reproducible across all levels of health care workers (with varying levels of training and expertise).<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is focused on developing a wearable, wireless respiratory monitor for measuring parameters related directly to airflow and other metrics of respiration.

When respiratory distress/obstruction happens during sedation, it occurs suddenly and to the untrained eye, the patient appears unchanged, as though they are asleep. Current monitors do not directly measure airflow as a function of respiration instead, they monitor the downstream effects of blocked airflow (such as decrease in oxygen), resulting in delayed response times. Adverse outcomes are more likely to occur when there is a significant delay between the development and the detection of respiratory depression/obstruction in sedated patients. Thus, the proposed technology may fill this critical need for a respiratory monitoring method that provides real time, quantitative feedback about airflow changes to allow for early recognition of respiratory depression, airway obstruction, and respiratory failure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ewbank-Popescu (University of St. Thomas) for research conducted with graduate and undergraduate students.  Research activities ranging from molecular biology to spectroscopy seek to understand the molecular mechanism by which the protein Fur regulates iron content inside bacteria.  Iron is an essential element for all living organisms.  However, iron overload can cause dangerous oxidative damage to cells under aerobic conditions.  Thus, tight regulation of the iron content is essential for cells to grow.  In bacteria, the Ferric Uptake Regulator (Fur) is a global iron regulator.  When iron content is too high, Fur becomes a transcription repressor to block formation of the iron transporters and prevent accumulation of excess iron in cells.  However, the mechanism by which Fur senses the intracellular iron content remains largely elusive.  This project is based on preliminary studies showing that in the bacterium  E coli, Fur can bind a cluster of Iron bound to Sulfur when the intracellular iron content is high.  The goal of the project is to determine how Fur may undergo the binding of this [2Fe-2S]-cluster in response to changes of the intracellular iron concentration and in turn regulate the expression of the genes related to iron metabolism in bacteria. This project will provide greater understanding of how bacteria, including infective bacteria in our tissues, can pull iron essential for growth from inside animal and plant cells, to be used instead for bacterial growth.  This will inform our knowledge of the interactions of bacteria with larger creatures in the ecosystem, agriculture, and health. The project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in vigorous and exciting interdisciplinary research activities.<br/><br/>The ferric iron regulator (Fur) is a highly conserved global iron regulator in bacteria. The current hypothesis states that when the intracellular ?free? iron content is elevated, Fur binds ferrous iron to form an ?iron-bound? Fur and regulates the intracellular iron homeostasis by controlling the expression of specific genes.  However, the ?iron-bound? Fur has never been isolated from any bacteria.  Preliminary studies revealed that the Escherichia coli Fur can bind a [2Fe-2S] cluster via the conserved cysteine residues in the E. coli mutant cells in which the intracellular iron content is elevated.  The goal of this project is to test a hypothesis that Fur regulates the intracellular iron homeostasis via reversible binding of a [2Fe-2S] cluster.  Aim 1 is to determine the redox properties and stability of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in Fur by combining biochemical and spectroscopic (including UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Mössbauer spectroscopy) approaches. Aim 2 is to investigate the physiological function of the [2Fe-2S] cluster-bound Fur by analyzing its specific DNA binding activity in vitro and the gene expression profile regulated by the [2Fe-2S] cluster-bound Fur in E. coli cells.  Aim 3 is to explore the conserved nature of the [2Fe-2S] cluster binding in Fur proteins from other bacteria.  Because Fur is highly conserved among bacteria, success of the project is expected to illustrate a novel mechanism by which Fur regulates the intracellular iron homeostasis in E. coli and other bacteria via an iron-sulfur cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project proposes implementation of low-cost composite materials in construction products is projected to reduce the lifecycle cost of utility and infrastructure projects through a combination of lower initial installation costs and lower service and maintenance costs over the life of the installed equipment. In automotive applications, vehicle weight reduction translates to reduced energy consumption, meaning better fuel economy in combustion vehicles or improved electric vehicle range, both of which reduce pollution.

This interdisciplinary research project investigates how, as aquifers gain more public attention, social life above the surface of the Earth intersects with the material world below it. The projects? central research question examines how spatial imaginaries of the underground change when aquifers acquire a prominent place in the public sphere. With water becoming one of the most endangered resources globally, policy makers and experts increasingly understand the urgency of engaging local actors in aquifer protection. However, their ideas of who those actors are and how they conceptualize aquifers often assume single-issue representations of human experience. This project counterbalances those representations by investigating aquifers as spatial formations laden with cultural meaning.<br/><br/>This research consists of a longitudinal, ethnographic, and multi-modal study of how increased circulation of scientific knowledge about aquifers recasts the relations between surface and subsurface, and reshapes the legal and cultural relations between property and environmental responsibility. The project investigates two recently created participatory aquifer management plans and focuses on the work that local residents, property owners, and public servants do to implement them. Specifically, the project (1) identifies the scientific ideas that circulate through participatory aquifer management plans, (2) documents how everyday citizens understand spatial features (surface and subsurface), (3) maps the projects through which participants enact their responsibility to protect aquifers, and (4) identifies the points of friction and the complementarities between demands to protect aquifers and the surface-based notions of property that participants hold. The project develops theoretical resources to conceptualize aquifers as more than water quantities waiting to be extracted. Methodologically, the project combines ethnographic research, data visualization techniques, and collaborative maping. Additionally, the project supports junior scholars with scientific training and professional mentoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Initial prototypes have been tested by physicians and respiratory therapists and have provided input for the user interface to reduce the complexity associated with user training. In addition, this proposed device has been developed with components that may be sourced locally for long-term sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the U.S. alone, 6.6 million people have visual impairments, and 1 in 45 people have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  Currently, there are several indoor navigation applications on the market but they have limitations such as inaccuracy of localization, high cost, and poor accessibility.  The proposed technology also may be extended to indoor navigation of other public facilities, such as school buildings, libraries, office buildings, and airports. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) application to provide indoor navigation with accurate location tracking, personalized planned routes, and turn-by-turn voice instruction for visually impaired persons and other users.  The proposed technology is based on integrated sensors and software, including existing surveillance camera systems, installed Bluetooth beacons, and a building information model of transportation or other public facilities, with a hybrid solution of a mobile phone localization app (using beacons, on-board sensors, and cameras along with 3D sensors). This technology will be incorporated with personalized user interfaces to provide a seamless service to the end users, while also providing valuable user information and facility use information to transportation infrastructure stakeholders. The proposed solution is a system-engineering approach to a challenging problem in urban transportation that integrates three major components: multilayer live facility modeling tools, hybrid mobile navigation algorithms, and multimodal human-centric interface designs.

The project has the potential to incentivize, build precedence for, and professionalize the value of mathematics teachers with doctoral degrees in K-12 school settings, where research and practice can be readily linked. The 15 participating teachers will earn a specialized doctorate of education in K-8 Mathematics Education.  They will also attend the University of Central Florida-Orange County Public Schools Teacher Leader Academy. This project aims to advance the impact of participating teachers by increasing their: 1) ability, knowledge, and social justice mindset; 2) mathematical content knowledge; 3) pedagogical content knowledge; and 4) leadership capacity.  <br/><br/>This project at the University of Central Florida (UCF) includes partnerships with Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), and City Year Orlando, a nonprofit whose members are young adults from diverse backgrounds serving one year of community service in OCPS as student success coaches. The project has the potential to be a transformative endeavor that will, through the 15 project teachers' dissertation studies, produce a broad collection of needed studies to inform the practical implementation of the four key recommendations outlined in the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Catalyzing Change framework. Organized by three interconnected and synergistic components (e.g., Multilayered Coaching Cycles, Repositioning Mathematics as a Gateway, and Mentoring Underrepresented STEM Education Professionals), the UCF-OCPS Teacher Leader Academy will provide a structure and support for teachers to apply in their urban classroom settings. These structures and supports include the uprooting of inequitable policies, practices, and structures described in Catalyzing Change. The project will serve as an innovative model for empowering STEM teachers with earned doctorates and increasing diversity of teachers in STEM fields. The UCF-OCPS Noyce Teacher Leader Academy aims to directly impact more than 200 additional K-8 mathematics teachers, more than 30 administrators, the estimated 9000 students in the schools where the project's teachers teach, more than 200 City Year Orlando young adults, and 2000 students served by City Year Orlando. Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to determine evidence-based outcomes of the project. The project's leadership team will disseminate results of the project through national and regional presentations, refereed journal articles, and a publicly-available website of resources.

A field of research that is proving increasingly relevant to protecting and enhancing these resources is synthetic biology. This field of scientific study is a joint application of science, technology, and engineering that manipulates cells to be used as tools to, for example, detect or mitigate biological or chemical threats in the environment. Such research already exists in the Mid-Atlantic region at academic institutions, in the private sector, and government laboratories. However, this research often occurs in isolation nor is it drawn collectively toward solving region-level challenges. This project is bringing regional research entities into a community to determine how synthetic biology in particular can be leveraged to enhance and protect agricultural and water resources. Alongside accelerating research by making expertise and resources known and shared efficiently, this project is developing a STEM workforce as well as entrepreneurship opportunities to accelerate regional economic development. This project represents the first phase in the development of a coordinated synthetic biology-enabled research network in the Mid-Atlantic region.<br/><br/>To build an evolvable, regional, synthetic biology-based research network, this project is bringing together new groups of investigators and shareable resources by investing in the development of institutional and regional web portals, regional research symposia and theme meetings to determine how synthetic biology can be leveraged to enhance and protect agricultural and water-based resources. The network also provides travel awards to catalyze new collaborative research among investigators, as well as STEM workforce and entrepreneurial development planning. In all of these network-forming activities, the participation of students, trainees, early career individuals, and under-represented groups is a priority.

NANOGrav carries out this study by monitoring the pulse arrival times of millisecond pulsars (MSPs), which are ultra-spin-stable neutron stars, and thus the most precise celestial clocks in the Universe.  GWs cause fluctuations in pulse arrival times that are correlated among different pulsars.  Discovering these correlations requires the synergy of experts in gravitational physics, data analysis, and astrophysics coming together in a collaborative environment.  In addition to monitoring a known list of MSPs, NANOGrav routinely discovers new MSPs to add to their study.  NANOGrav reaches large numbers of the general public through exhibits and talks, and a growing social media presence.  An associated student research program reaches more than 150 undergraduate students every year, and the Pulsar Search Collaboratory involves hundreds of middle and high school students and their teachers.<br/><br/>The sources most likely to be detected in the nanohertz band in the near future are supermassive binary black holes that form after massive galaxies merge.  In fact, NANOGrav searches so far have already placed astrophysically interesting constraints on the evolution of galaxies and their supermassive black holes.  Other sources include cosmic strings, phase transitions in the early universe, and relic GW from inflation; detecting any of these would be transformative.  GW observations can also be used to investigate the origin of cosmic acceleration and the conflict between quantum mechanics and general relativity, two of the most profound challenges currently facing fundamental physics.

A total of 253 million people suffer from blindness or visual impairment, and 89% live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Cataract surgery has been shown to improve physical and mental health, income, productivity, and quality of life, but it remains the leading cause of blindness globally. The limitations of phacoemulsification have prevented broad implementation across emerging markets, causing disadvantaged patients and those with mature cataracts to receive manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS).  MSICS involves removal of the whole, intact cataract through a large incision. This 6-7 mm incision leads to increased recovery time and astigmatism. Issues with affordability and acceptability of treatment delays care-seeking behavior, causing development of mature cataracts, and sometimes leading to blindness and significant functional limitations. By enabling non-ultrasonic fragmentation of even mature cataracts through a 3 mm incision in a time- and cost-efficient manner, the proposed technology has the potential to improve the acceptability and accessibility of cataract surgery in LMICs, increase the surgical volume and capacity of eye care systems, and provide improved visual and financial outcomes for the 21 million patients receiving cataract surgery annually in LMICs.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project represents a novel approach to address vision loss and blindness due to cataracts. Globally, 12.6 million people are blind and 52.6 million have moderate-to-severe visual impairment due to cataracts. Cataract surgery is a simple, sight-restoring procedure where the clouded lens of the eye is removed and replaced with a synthetic lens. Cataract-related visual impairment is concentrated in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), and is expected to grow dramatically with the aging population. The current phacoemulsification procedure involving ultrasonic cataract emulsification through a 3 mm incision is not ideal for emerging markets due to the length, cost, significant capital expense, recurring costs, and maintenance. Moreover, phacoemulsification is not optimal for treating ultra-hard, late-stage cataracts found in LMICs which require increased ultrasound power. The proposed technology consists of a low-cost, handheld, manual cataract surgery device which addresses the limitations of phacoemulsification and has the potential to achieve comparable or improved safety and efficacy. The device is deployed through a 3 mm incision and can capture and safely fragment all cataract sizes and hardnesses. It eliminates the need for capital equipment, maintenance, and electricity. Importantly, the device fits into the existing training and surgical workflow in emerging markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In general, the demand for millimeter (mm)-wave transistors is steadily increasing.  In these devices, electromagnetic wave propagation effects and heat dissipation are among the most limiting factors for production. The proposed technologies in this project are applied to the design and fabrication of optimized mm-wave transistors.  These transistors demonstrate superior performance compared to currently available technologies. In addition, the devices have a smaller footprint compared to conventional transistors performing the same functionality. The new designs result in more devices per wafer, and each individual device may be capable of producing higher power and operating over a wider bandwidth. Such performance enhancements may allow savings in cost per component. Moreover, the new transistors may have characteristics enabling them to meet more stringent performance specifications. Subsequently, new systems with advanced functionalities may be designed that will open new market areas.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a fabrication technology that is applicable to high-frequency semiconductor devices. The proposed technology describes novel transistor electrode designs to match the phase velocity of the propagating waves on the input and output electrodes. This enables relaxation of the current limitations on the electrode width, which reduces the number of fingers needed to meet the desired device gain, output power, and other performance parameters. The competitive advantage of the proposed technology is to allow fabricating wider transistors, which provides more radio frequency power. The thermal management issues and their associated challenges in mm-wave transistors also are addressed in this project. The proposed technology modifies the substrates enabling them to act as better heat absorbers by enhancing their overall thermal conductance. The novelty in this technology is founded on improvements in thermal properties of the die to extract the heat generated at the surface and/or in the active layer at the junctions, offering enhanced capabilities for heat removal. Results from research on the analysis of the transistor performances demonstrate the promise of this technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, many employers offer or require training in ethics, compliance, and related topics. Most prior research into the impacts of such experiences has focused on engineering students, especially undergraduates. There have been very few studies that have tracked these students as they enter the workforce in order to study the impacts of these experiences early in their careers.<br/>This project explores how early career engineers? perceptions of ethics and social responsibility change in the transition from undergraduate engineering degree programs to the workplace (or graduate studies) and how those perceptions are shaped or influenced. It also asks how those perceptions vary depending on an individual?s engineering discipline, background, and current professional setting.<br/>Specific priority is given to investigating differences in perceptions and experiences among underrepresented groups. In addition to contributing to the literature and impacting practices in engineering education and professional ethics, the findings from this project have implications for workforce development by revealing how employers can better align onboarding programs, professional development opportunities, and organizational climate with the views and perceptions of young professionals.<br/><br/>This study uses both survey (quantitative) and interview (qualitative) research methods. Data is being gathered in two phases. The first study phase will begin by surveying and interviewing participants from a prior study who are now early career professionals and/or pursuing graduate degrees. The responses of participants in these surveys and interviews can be compared to their prior responses as engineering students, making visible how their perceptions have changed over time and across the transition from school to professional practice. In the second phase of the study, a new group of participants will be surveyed and interviewed, which will allow for a larger and more diverse participant pool. Appropriate statistical techniques will be used to investigate longitudinal changes and group-level results in the survey data set, while thematic and phenomenographic approaches will be used to analyze the interview data. This analysis will shed light on how young career engineers? perceptions of social and ethical responsibility are shaped by their experiences in their undergraduate studies and their current contexts.<br/><br/>This proposal was funded through the ER2 program by the CISE directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current alternative power supplies are indispensable in remote rural areas where people lack access to reliable power grid infrastructure. However, travelers, hikers, or campers may find these alternatives cost- or safety-prohibitive. Disaster relief or military personnel deployed to remote areas may find that in addition to the mobility issues, current battery devices are costly on a large scale and fuel solutions are risky for those supplying fuel to those situated in hostile environments. Using the proposed technology, a hiker?s or soldier?s backpack may be turned into a power supply. A solar cell may be sewn into the bag to harvest solar energy that will be stored by the bag supercapacitor. Similarly, the fabric supercapacitor may be embedded into tent material, making the tent into a solar power supply as well. A sustainable, self-powered system make it possible for travelers to remote areas or for soldiers deployed for military operations. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology for making fabric supercapacitors (FSCs). The proposed technology includes various fabric materials, structural design of the fabric, and a novel fabrication approach. The energy storage ability of the FSC device will be determined by the size of the fabric areas used for forming the supercapacitor structure.  Compared with conventional supercapacitors, the proposed FSC technology is flexible, light weight, and safe. In addition, the bendable, twistable, rollable, and foldable design provides space that may be inaccessible to conventional supercapacitors. A demonstration of the technology showed that four series supercapacitors illuminated a red LED for more than 130 min and still maintained a voltage output around 1.61 V. The supercapacitor was susceptible to cyclic bending in 0-180 degree angles without losing its performance.

According to the EPA, 7 million tons of waste glass is sent to the landfill annually. The proposed technology uses a pozzolan, a cement replacement that commonly replaces 20% of the cement used in standard mixes with glass materials (here, silicon dioxide) in the manufacturing industry.  Generally for every 1 ton of cement produced, 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, is released. This translates to one house foundation of cement producing the CO2 emissions equivalent of driving a car for 2.5 years. The EPA estimates that the cement industry produces 86.8 million metric tons of CO2 each year, exceeding emissions by the aviation industry.  For every 5 tons of the newly developed cement replacement material used, the equivalent of one car is taken off the road in terms of CO2. At full scale, the concrete industry could see a carbon savings equivalent of taking 1.75 million cars off the road every year. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential and commercialization strategies for a new process to take waste glass from the recycling industry and turn it into a pozzolan called Pantheon?.

Currently, the most common pozzolan on the market is fly ash from coal power plants. Pantheon? offers superior properties and performance. First, Pantheon? has a 13.4% higher concentration of silicon dioxide, the active ingredient in pozzolans. Second Pantheon? has 19% fewer impurities than fly ash. This results in a concrete that is less expensive, more environmentally friendly, and 11% stronger than what is currently on the market.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will conduct a series of design investigations to illuminate the critical new phenomenon of transparency to rebuild public trust in one such information institution--journalistic organizations. Marrying mass communications research with human-centered computing, this research will take a novel interdisciplinary approach to answer the following questions. How can online information platforms effectively embrace the ideal of transparency as a means to increase trust? How can news organizations effectively demonstrate to the public the primary features that make a story trustworthy and the core aspects that govern the production and reporting of a news story?<br/> <br/>The research will be conducted along three phases. The first involves understanding the current practices of online news production and consumption with respect to trustworthiness. Phase 1 will result in a rich description of what constitutes trustworthy information online and inform the development of a brand new, transformative class of transparency artifacts. In the second phase, this project will appropriate theories from Communications research and combine with data mining and natural language-based techniques from the Computing field, to build transparency features highlighting key aspects of news reporting. Specifically, it will explore two classes of transparency tools: disclosure and participatory. Disclosure transparency will communicate the production, framing, and journalistic standards around news reports. Participatory transparency will aim at getting users involved in the news cycle through two channel-based interactive features: commenting capability and hovering to see additional information. Finally, phase 3 includes interface evaluations via experiments followed by participatory design workshops with the two primary stakeholders of an online news system--journalists and news readers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project establishes theoretical understanding, including new lower and upper bounds, of the extent to which various notions of obliviosness impact the performance of programs. The investigators also explore the practical performance of new privacy-preserving algorithms in cloud outsourcing and database scenarios.

The resulting variability and disturbed conditions leads to harmful impacts on technological systems and even to risk to humans. Scientific imperatives and practical concerns converge in making space weather a rising priority for society and national planners. This collaborative project provides support for a consortium of four U.S. universities to continue the operations of a suite of High Frequency coherent-backscatter radars within the NSF Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS). This extension will enable a broad range of research across the space science community. The U.S. consortium functions as part of the international Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) which encompasses more than 35 radars distributed from mid through high to polar latitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The leveraged benefits of the activities include student participation in the engineering and scientific tasks required to operate the network and to achieve the desired data products.<br/><br/>SuperDARN is well known for producing maps of the large-scale circulation of ionospheric plasma that can be compared in terms of scientific significance and practical utility to maps of winds and pressure systems in tropospheric weather. The radars observe a wide range of effects in the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere thermosphere system that bear directly on understanding and modeling space weather events. The award will continue a program of continued observations while also achieving significant refurbishment of eleven U.S. radars located in North America and add the operations of two new radars in Iceland that are being built on separate support. It will also enable, with partial funding and by virtue of the availability of data, a broad range of research by the U.S. SuperDARN scientists on such new themes as convection in the inner magnetosphere, subauroral ionospheric convection, and solar flare impacts on the ionosphere. As a consequence of this award, the U.S. research community will be supplied with data from the entire set of SuperDARN radars and assisted in the application of SuperDARN data and data products. The award will provide new data products to the community include mapping of ionospheric plasma convection at much improved spatial resolution and techniques for applying machine learning to geospace datasets. In coordination with international collaborators simplified methods for data access will be developed that meet the emerging requirements by agencies and journals to make data discoverable and interoperable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Design of optimum strategies for groundwater and fossil fuel resources development is generally done through the application of computer simulation programs where users need to input a set of flow and transport properties of the reservoir rock. The traditional approach to estimate flow and transport properties of reservoir rocks consists of using deterministic model equations. This approach frequently results in large disagreement between measured and simulated multiphase flow and reactive transport processes in carbonate reservoirs. The complex heterogeneous pore microstructure of carbonate rocks is reflected by stochastic (random) relationships between fundamental petrophysical properties (e.g., porosity) and flow and transport properties (e.g., permeability and tortuosity) of carbonate rocks that are practically impossible to capture by deterministic model equations. The goals of this research are (1) to develop a predictive understanding of the stochastic relationship between the pore microstructure and flow and transport properties of carbonate rocks, and (2) to establish machine learning models that capture the stochastic relationship between fundamental petrophysical properties and flow and transport properties of carbonate rocks. This research will advance national welfare and prosperity by enabling the design of environmentally responsible and optimum strategies to develop groundwater and fossil fuel resources from carbonate reservoirs, and it will contribute to the education of students on the use of artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) technologies to develop groundwater and fossil fuel resources. <br/><br/>The goals of this research will be achieved by using a novel approach that overcomes limitations regarding the relatively small number of pore microstructures and associated flow and transport properties of carbonate rocks that can be experimentally determined by routine and special analyses. This novel approach consists of the construction of thousands of 3D pore microstructures of stochastic pore connectivity honoring pore size distribution curves obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements and pore geometries obtained from 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Direct pore-scale simulations of flow and transport properties for thousands of 3D pore microstructures of the same pore size distribution and dominant pore geometry, but different pore connectivity, as it happens in real carbonate rocks, will make possible achieving the goals of this research by applying statistical/stochastic principles and machine learning technologies. The focus will be on carbonate rocks collected from the Mississippian Lime Play and Arbuckle Group in Oklahoma and Kansas.

One of the universal challenges in the management of these historical contaminants is that they can be transported by both the wind and in water (generally attached to sediments in water).  Clarification of the relative importance of these transport pathways is fundamental to the successful management of contaminated soils and prevention of future soil degradation worldwide.  In many cases, there are substantial delays in the water-sediment pathway, and these delays create challenges in risk evaluation of recent contamination.  Further, more recent activities such as urbanization can remobilize historical contamination.  This project focuses on the Yunnan region of China, a region with multiple historical periods of metal extraction and purification.  Reconstruction of the long history of interactions between the airborne and waterborne contaminant transport in the Yunnan allows examination of the environmental implications of substantial global metal contamination that has occurred with the industrial revolution and the influence of land use changes on contaminant mobilization. <br/><br/>This research aims to develop a longer-term perspective of sediment dynamics in southwestern China and assess the timing, magnitude, rate, and source of metal accumulation in lake environments.  In particular, the project links three goals: 1) Quantitatively estimate the amount of metal contaminants stored in watershed soils and attribute their source using geochemical mixing models; 2) Identify the controls on erosion, transport, accumulation, and redistribution of these metal contaminants, particularly human controls by examination of historical events recorded in sediments; and 3) Document the influences of natural climate variability versus human activity on metal accumulation in lake systems.  When combined, these goals provide the means to measure the risks of contamination stored in the landscape to all modern human systems and enhance our understanding of how cumulative watershed impacts influence our Earth system.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, and the Office of International Science and Engineering."

The Concord Consortium in collaboration with Purdue University will research and develop an engineering education technology and pedagogy that will support project-based learning of science, engineering, and computation concepts and skills underlying the strategically important ""smart"" and ""green"" aspects of the infrastructure. This project will develop transformative technologies and curriculum materials to turn the campus of a high school or a geographical information system such as Google Maps into an engineering laboratory with virtually unlimited opportunities for learning and exploration. The project will deliver two innovations: 1) The Smart High School is an engineering platform for designing Internet of Things systems for managing the resources, space, and processes of a school based on real-time analysis of data collected by various sensors deployed by students on campus; and 2) the Virtual Solar World is a computational modeling platform for students to design, deploy, and connect virtual solar power solutions for their homes, schools, and regions. Six standards-aligned curriculum units based on these technologies will be developed to guide student learning and support educational research.

Most studies of patterns and processes responsible for vegetation change have focused on deciduous shrubs, which have shown increases in abundance throughout much of the Arctic.  Fewer studies have examined changes in tree abundance at the interface between arctic tundra and the boreal forest. This project will take advantage of historical aerial images collected throughout the Brooks Range during the 1950s and 1970s to provide a comprehensive census of changes in tree abundance in recent decades in northern Alaska. Investigators will also test hypotheses about whether differences in nutrition, colder soils, and more widespread permafrost explain why trees in the western Brooks Range have increased their growth in response to recent warming, while those in the eastern Brooks Range have not. In addition, the investigators plan extensive education and outreach activities in rural and urban Alaska. Rural efforts will include visiting classrooms in Kotzebue High School to share research results, providing opportunities for Kotzebue High School students to join the research team in the field, arrainging to be interviewed by local public radio stations, and delivering public lectures at National Park Service headquarters in several local villages. In Anchorage, the investigators plan to equip a public high school in Anchorage with supples needed to conduct tree-ring research, train students in standard methods, and help them design a study to link white spruce tree ring data in their backyards to long term climate records. <br/><br/>The relative abundance of forest and tundra has important implications for surface energy exchange, carbon cycling, wildlife habitat and the availability of subsistence resources at high latitudes. The northern limit of the boreal forest in Alaska is formed within the Brooks Range. The eastern Brooks Range is an area well known to dendrochronologists as an epicenter of divergent tree growth responses to climate warming. Divergence refers to the deterioration of historically strong positive correlations between temperature and tree growth. The recognition that divergence has been widespread in the circumboreal has undermined confidence in paleoclimate reconstructions and created uncertainty in projections of vegetation-climate feedbacks. While divergence is a well-known phenomenon, its implications for changes in tree abundance and shifts in treeline position remain unknown. Recent findings in four watersheds along a west to east gradient in the Brooks Range suggest colder, more permafrost-affected soils limit tree access to soil nutrients and may be the cause of divergence in the eastern Brooks Range.  In this study, investigators will expand the spatial extent of this previous work to examine the causes and consequences of divergence in the Brooks Range. They will combine repeat aerial photography with tree-ring analysis and detailed measurements of tree microclimates, mycorrhizal associations, nutrient relations, and reproductive effort in 25 Brooks Range watersheds to yield broad-scale mechanistic insights into controls on tree growth and changes in tree abundance in a changing climate. They will test the hypothesis that positive growth responses to warming and increased tree abundance will prevail in the western Brooks Range and in habitats with warmer soils, while neutral growth responses to warming and stagnant treelines will be common in the eastern Brooks Range and in areas with cold soils.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project develops novel algorithms that incorporate educational psychology to help teach humans the knowledge encoded in machine learning algorithms. The project evaluates the two forms of assistance by tracking human performance improvement in user studies.

However, little is known about how these kinds of data should be processed and presented to reflect teachers' decision-making and pedagogical desires. To address this gap, this project will reimagine teachers' assessment literacy in data- and technology-rich classrooms by leveraging a game-based assessment to help teachers become educated and critical consumers of analytics and algorithms embedded in educational technology. With more literate teachers, it is possible to maximize the potential of educational technology so that teachers can provide personalized and data-driven feedback during the process of learning.<br/><br/>This project will leverage an existing game-based assessment, Shadowspect, that measures Common Core math standards as well as cognitive and noncognitive skills such as spatial reasoning and persistence. The researchers will conduct design-based research to iteratively develop and embed interactive dashboards in the game and investigate how effectively different representations and features of the dashboards can support teachers' understanding and inform their actions. Additionally, the researchers will investigate how learning analytics can be used to directly support K-12 teachers' assessment practices and identify the knowledge and skills  teachers need to be successful in this area. The ultimate goal of the research is to understand teachers' assessment literacy in the era of big data and yield generalizable design principles for interactive dashboard tools that can facilitate teachers' data use without substantive external training. Ultimately, this research can lead to future investigations of how teachers' formative assessment practices might change when they have an increased understanding of learning analytics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prolonged brain growth through development, along with a particularly long life, are essential to the emergence of human cognition, but may also lead to greater susceptibility to psychiatric and aging-related neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer's disease. This project will characterize molecular changes in the brains of humans and other primates across the adult lifespan to identify features that distinguish the human pattern of brain development and aging. The results of this project will help pinpoint the genetic mechanisms underlying dynamic lifespan changes that are unique to human neurobiology and may improve our understanding of common medical conditions. The project will involve mentoring and building the analytical skills of trainees at different career stages (postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate), and communicating results of this study to members of the public through accessible educational programming.<br/><br/>The genetic and physiological basis of human brain development and aging are not fully understood. Changes in methylation are important in development and aging, and plasticity of methylation appears to play a key role in the brain, contributing to processes like the formation of neuronal connections. Previous studies have identified differences in brain methylation patterns among primate species, and the investigators' prior work suggests that genes acting in the nervous system undergo alterations in methylation with advancing age. This project will specifically investigate DNA methylation in four brain regions. The work will build on existing research by taking a comparative approach to identify differences in the trajectories of methylation change in several distinct brain regions across adulthood among four primate species, including humans. Identifying differences among primate brains in age-related change could help us understand the origins of traits distinguishing human brains, including aspects of neurobiological aging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also protects technological infrastructure from damage from solar storms. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by organized motions of liquid iron in the Earth's outer core - the geodynamo - by processes that are not fully understood. Key observable features that can be used to inform models of the geodynamo include magnetic field strength and orientation, both of which change over geologic time. Existing records of the temporal variation of magnetic field strength are incomplete and potentially compromised by secondary processes. A potential new archive originates from the protective nature of the field. Cosmic rays continually strike the atmosphere, but their flux is modulated by the magnetic field. Stronger magnetic fields provide greater deflection of cosmic rays from Earth, and weaker fields provide less deflection. The flux of cosmic rays in turn controls the production rate of cosmogenic nuclides - rare isotopes produced when cosmic rays collide with gases in the atmosphere. Several cosmogenic nuclide archives have already been used to establish the history of magnetic field strength. This project will take exploratory steps towards development of a new high temporal resolution archive: the abundance of tritium - a cosmogenic nuclide with a half-life of 12 years - in fluid inclusions trapped in cave deposits of various ages. As an isotope of hydrogen, the post-production behavior of tritium will be controlled by the atmospheric water cycle, and will not suffer the same complications as previously measured cosmogenic nuclide archives of magnetic field strength.<br/><br/>The decay product of tritium (3He) will be measured in water pockets that are trapped by stalagmites as they grow. The working hypothesis is that these water inclusions take in tritium in proportion to its production by cosmic rays in the atmosphere via the delivery of local rainwater into the cave system. After entrapment, tritium decays to 3He, which is thereafter retained in the water inclusion until analysis. Stalagmites often have annual bands, and can be dated accurately using U/Th geochronology. Taken together, these ideas suggest stalagmites offer a potential record of geomagnetic field changes with better temporal detail than those provided by alternative methods and with independent sources of potential error. This project will take the first steps for creating such a record by developing the necessary analytical methods and then by analyzing stalagmites that captured atmospheric tritium created by nuclear weapons testing in the latter half of the 20th century to confirm that the putative archive works as expected. Because the atmospheric tritium production from bomb testing is well-documented, the archive will be subjected to a very rigorous test. The two products sought by the end of the proposed work are a) a methodology that can successfully liberate and measure the tritiogenic 3He in speleothems, and b) a confirmation or refutation of the key hypothesis of this proposal: Tritiogenic 3He preserved in water inclusions in speleothems can be measured and will change as a function of the concentration of tritium in local precipitation."

Among these tools are program analyzers which are automated tools for verifying the absence of specific classes of errors such as unsafe memory accesses. While used both for program optimization by compilers, and for eliminating software defects by software developers, program analyzers by themselves are not verified: their reliability is largely assumed and, in current practice, they inhabit a software's trusted computing base. This project develops (a) foundational theories for synthesizing program analyzers directly from their specifications; (b) practical implementations of program analyzers; and (c) rigorous evaluations of both foundational techniques as well as implementations via a mixture of formal methods, software development, and empirical case studies. Underlying these results is the potential for widespread adoption of these tools in practice thus leading to higher reliability of software more generally.<br/><br/>The project's techniques and tools will enable the deductive synthesis of sound program analysers in proof assistants in an interactive, mostly-automated style, and using the calculational framework of abstract interpretation with Galois connections. The investigators evaluate this approach by first comparing to existing tools: Fiat, an existing tool for semi-automated deductive synthesis in the theorem prover Coq but which does not support Galois connections, and Constructive Galois Connections, an existing framework for embedding Galois connections in Agda language but which does not support automation. The investigators compare these results with existing on-paper derivations of correct-by-construction program analyzers, as well as existing information flow analyzers which were not derived using the abstract interpretation framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The strength and durability of metallic materials is limited by the conventional compositions and manufacturing technologies. In particular, aluminum alloys suffer from corrosion susceptibility when subjected to processing techniques used to increase the strength of many alloys. The development of new aluminum alloys, with concurrent high strength and corrosion resistance, requires new scientific knowledge of the mechanisms that control corrosion and deformation behavior in these materials. This award supports fundamental research to uncover these mechanisms of degradation and strengthening. The investigation will also support the development of the knowledge base and workforce for the nation's future. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this research will be trained to address future technological challenges in a multidisciplinary setting. The outcomes of the research will help in developing teaching materials to support the nation's first undergraduate program in corrosion engineering at the University of Akron, and to support K-12 outreach activities to work with the local communities and high school students to increase STEM awareness.<br/><br/>Use of aluminum (Al) alloys is limited in many applications due to their limited strength and deterioration of the corrosion performance with efforts made to increase their strength. Therefore, developing new Al alloys exhibiting ultra-high strength and excellent corrosion resistance is of paramount importance.  It is hypothesized that grain refinement < 100 nm and extended solid solubility of Vanadium (V) in Al can improve mechanical and corrosion properties simultaneously. Nanocrystalline Al-V alloys with a wide range of V content will be produced using high-energy ball milling. The alloys will be exposed to various heat treatments for studying the thermal stability and creating a wide range of grain size, V solid solubility, and intermetallic distribution. The role of the microstructure on passivation, corrosion initiation and propagation processes, and mechanical properties will be studied using state-of-the-art material and surface characterization, electrochemical and mechanical testing techniques. This investigation will advance scientific understanding of the: 1) influence of the processing on the structure, corrosion and mechanical behavior of the nanostructured Al-V alloys, 2) role of nanocrystalline structure, intermetallics, and extended solid solubility of V on the corrosion and mechanical properties, and 3) phenomena leading to the simultaneous improvement in corrosion and mechanical properties. Fundamental understanding developed in this research will lead to a theoretical framework for the development of ultra-strong and corrosion resistant Al alloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Magnesium, the third most abundant metal, is the lightest of all structural metals and therefore has attracted significant attention for a number of industries including aerospace, automotive, and infrastructure applications. Magnesium alloys also possess excellent biocompatibility and support bone growth, and thus these alloys are also considered candidate materials for biomedical applications. The use of magnesium alloys in these applications, however, is limited but their poor resistance to environmental degradation and low strength. The ability to mitigate the corrosion of magnesium alloys while simultaneously increasing the strength could revolutionize the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as the field of biomaterials. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research to understand the fundamental mechanisms of both strength and corrosion resistance in magnesium alloys, with the goal of providing unprecedented control over the properties and making it possible to tailor these materials for specific technical applications. The work also incorporates far-reaching educational and outreach objectives to inspire students in grades K-12 to purse education in STEM disciplines; to recruit, retain and support outstanding and diverse student groups at undergraduate and graduate levels; and to provide students the opportunities for active learning, mentorship, and scholarship related to this research areas. The outreach programs include research opportunities to high school students, working with the high school teachers to stimulate interests in STEM fields among young students and broaden participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/><br/>This research will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the properties of metastable nanocrystalline magnesium (Mg) alloys and the mechanisms that can enable high strength and corrosion resistant Mg alloys. Inspired by the phenomenon causing the ""stainless"" behavior in stainless steels, an innovative approach of improving mechanical strength and corrosion resistance of Mg alloys will be undertaken. The specific objectives of this research are to: 1) produce Mg alloys with a wide range of grain size, dispersion of intermetallics, and solid solubility of the alloying element; 2) study the influence of the nanocrystalline structure, the solid solubility of the metal alloying elements, and intermetallics on corrosion and mechanical properties; 3) identify the key mechanisms causing simultaneous improvement in corrosion and mechanical properties of magnesium alloys, and develop a theoretical framework for designing high strength corrosion resistant magnesium alloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Automated hypotheses generation systems are designed to help scientists to overcome these difficulties and accelerate their research. The pandemic situation with COVID-19 is precisely one of the cases when such systems can play an extremely important role in coping with the coronavirus. Using two different AI approaches, we have developed two systems to discover plausible hypotheses in the biomedical domain. In this project, we will will deploy the COVID-19 customized hypothesis generation and knowledge discovery system, massively run it on any relevant to this research queries, and publish the results (including trained AI models, and discovered information) in the open domain for broad scientific community with the goal to accelerate the COVID-19 research. This work focuses heavily on addressing fundamental knowledge discovery questions by modeling and formulating scientific hypotheses using the publicly available information in the biomedical domain. However, in general, these methods are not restricted to any specific information domain, i.e., they can be broadly used to discover knowledge in texts. Although our experimental work will be related to COVID-19, the methods can be applied with some reservations to any literature-based analysis. For example, in the Materials Science Initiative, one of the goals is to establish a systematic understanding of the material properties and discover new materials which can be done by analyzing using the massive corpus of papers. In the legal world, identifying related patents can be done using a similar hypothesis modeling methodology.<br/><br/>In the heart of the proposed approach lies a big multi-modal and multi-relational semantic knowledge network of all biomedical objects extracted from a variety of heterogeneous databases of the National Library of Medicine. These objects include but are not limited to scientific papers, abstracts, keywords, phrases, elements of thesaurus, genes, proteins, mutations, pathways, diseases, and diagnoses. We will leverage two systems, namely MOLIERE and AGATHA, that are based on structural and deep learning, respectively. We will customize them using the rapidly updated dataset of new papers that has not been yet processed by the National Library of Medicine but already exists in the open domain such as in various preprint archives and reports. The MOLIERE system is based on the network analysis techniques applied on the graph constructed using the low-dimensional embedding of the papers with the result interpretation methods that are based on the probabilistic topic modeling. The AGATHA system processes texts at much finer granularity, and creates a semantic knowledge network using more accurate embedding techniques followed by the deep learning training for knowledge discovery. Two systems complement each other. While the AGATHA is of higher quality, the MOLIERE is more interpretable. A combination of both will be leveraged in this research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
