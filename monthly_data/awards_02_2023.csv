In creating opportunities for families to discover the remains of their relatives, these technologies have established conditions where new forms of social relationships and kinship relations might be forged or redefined. DNA identification projects, especially state-funded ones, are also circumscribed by inclusion and exclusion criteria in the selection of remains for reidentification and analysis. This doctoral dissertation research investigates whether, and in what ways, the scientific identification of war dead will reshape kinship, memory, and belonging. More particularly, this research examines the cultural processes embedded in the scientific identification of the dead and its impacts on memory, identity, and social relations of the living. The findings will be disseminated as op-eds to the broader public through public media channels as well as non-academic reports to the main stakeholders involved in the study. The project trains a graduate student in scientific methods of data collection and analysis and broaden the participation of historically underrepresented groups in the production of scientific knowledge. <br/><br/>Through an ethnographic study with forensic scientists and family members of war dead, the researchers will analyze the sociotechnical processes involved in the identification as well as the (competing) values, perceptions, and memory of both the scientists and the families regarding conflict and national identity. The researchers will participate in the daily activities at the forensic laboratory and observe commemoration rituals and objects at the homes of family members of war dead. Data will be collected using participant observation, interviews, oral histories, and archival research. The findings will shed light on whether, and in what ways, the DNA identification project of war dead will restore some kinds of ancestral relations disrupted by wars and conflicts, reshape the relationship between families and the nation as well as reconstruct or reconcile past political divisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A cross-disciplinary team of practitioners and researchers seek to accomplish this by addressing students' sense of belonging and self-regulation of learning both of which are known to have a key impact on keeping students enrolled in STEM programs. These two strategies address individuals' behavior around their perception of themselves as members of a community who are valued, accepted, included, and involved. These strategies also impact students' perception of themselves as independent and effective learners. Eight modules will be developed, implemented, and refined for second- and third-year college students that engage students in activities centered on building sense of belonging and self-regulated learning strategies. These modules can either be embedded in engineering courses or used informally as optional activities. The eight new modules will be piloted in two required civil engineering courses and the impact of the activities on student development will be evaluated. This project has the potential to advance knowledge of how STEM post-secondary educators can take steps to increase completion of STEM degrees. <br/><br/>This project aims to improve the student experience and performance in STEM courses, and ultimately have an impact on the retention of STEM majors. To accomplish this, the project will draw upon published research and the findings of a pilot study to develop and refine a set of on-line learning modules that synergistically interweave the learning of STEM topics with the building of sense of belonging and the development of effective self-regulation of learning skills. The objectives of the project are to: 1) design eight on-line modules, 2) implement modules for two cohorts of students in the second and third year of college, 3) monitor student learning and development during implementation of modules, 4) refine the modules with student-partners using monitoring data and evaluator feedback, 5) evaluate the efficacy of the modules in other STEM courses and on reducing attrition, and 6) develop instructor and student guidance. The project will take place within the Civil Engineering program of a large minority-serving public university system. Project activities will be accomplished collaboratively by a team of civil engineering and educational psychology academics, and numerous student researchers. An external evaluator will collect data from multiple sources and use qualitative and quantitative methods to discover patterns to inform the formative and summative evaluations and ensure that revisions to the work are data-driven and comprehensive. The work will be disseminated using multiple platforms across academic, research, and university communities. The project has the potential to provide the STEM education community with strategies that can be embedded directly in courses that increase retention and completion of STEM degrees across diverse student populations.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These tools are essential for building digital twins of real-world objects and will enable new applications in a wide array of fields including computer vision, computational imaging, robotics, and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR). Unlike many existing methods that are purely data-driven, this research will develop inference techniques that leverage a simulator of how light propagates. This simulator will be differentiable, meaning that it is possible to smoothly relate its control parameters to its decisions, offering a new level of generality and physical accuracy for recovering parameters reliably under complex scenarios such as illumination from reflected light. Project outcomes have the potential for broad impact by creating new areas in computer graphics and computational photonics. Additional broad impact will derive from the PI's commitment to promoting STEM education for underrepresented minorities, and from the project facilitating UCI?s outreach programs at the undergraduate and high school levels including lab visits to allow hands-on experience with software development. <br/><br/>This research will enable differentiable and inverse rendering that is efficient, physically accurate, and sufficiently general to handle arbitrary scene parameters under a wide variety of light transport phenomena. The work will make the following four core contributions: first, devising new mathematical tools to describe how infinitesimal changes in a virtual scene affect the distribution of light, supporting a variety of light transport models including steady state, polarized, and transient; second, introducing physics-based differentiable rendering algorithms that enjoy the generality of the new formulations while providing low-variance derivative estimates; third, leveraging these algorithms to build differentiable rendering software systems capable of efficiently handling complex real-world configurations; and, lastly, utilizing the new algorithms and systems to introduce physics-based inverse rendering pipelines that offer a new level of generality and accuracy benefiting a wide array of applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key area is learning motor or physical skills of tremendous practical (such as training for surgery), scientific (such as understanding motor memory) and cultural (such as music and sports) interest. To learn new motor skills or recover them after an injury, people often need intensive training or rehabilitation therapy with an expert who can instruct, assess performance, provide feedback, support, and motivate. Working with an expert can ensure learners achieve desired results, exercise correctly, avoid injury, and gain insights into their own performance. But an expert may not always be accessible or available, particularly in situations where demand for experts exceeds supply or when people have personal, monetary, or geographic limitations that prevent access. To deal with the absence of an expert, alternatives for learning at home include books, videos, apps, and online services (such as ClassPass, Peloton, Mirror). Although these options successfully provide explanations and demonstrations, none of them can provide meaningful real-time feedback to the trainees. This project leverages recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and eXtended Reality (XR) technologies to build new types of interactive motor skill training and rehabilitation systems where users receive real-time feedback from AI agents represented as 3D avatars. By building AI agents that emulate the real-time verbal and non-verbal behaviors of a human expert, the project will provide foundational knowledge on underlying principles that govern human-AI interactions in the context of motor skill learning (specifically, rehabilitation therapy). The project has the potential to broaden access to motor skill learning and rehabilitation at home by reducing financial or psychological barriers at low cost, with low intrusion, and at scale. Given that algorithms are increasingly making inroads into societally consequential domains, understanding how humans and AI agents interact has broad potential implications for the design of responsible and explainable AI. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate the design of AI-XR (artificial intelligence - extended reality) systems for motor skill learning and rehab. Specifically, the project advances a new human-AI interface paradigm in which the AI is represented as a 3D humanoid agent in XR that can mimic the real-time verbal and non-verbal behaviors of a human trainer to support motor learning in the absence of a human expert. Human expert trainers make use of multimodal feedback through visual, auditory, and haptic channels when providing the necessary explanations, demonstrations, and corrections of physical motion performance. To emulate natural interactions between a trainee and an expert trainer, the AI agents will be designed to recognize and respond to a user?s physical actions in real-time to near-real-time, appear and act human-like, and use verbal and non-verbal behaviors (such as eye gaze, head nods, facial expressions, and gestures) to communicate. Developing AI agents for motor learning therefore presents numerous technical and generalizable research challenges, including (i) how to design effective multimodal instruction and feedback mechanisms and (ii) how to enable natural interactions between the user and an AI agent. To tackle these challenges, the project will implement new (i) algorithms and AI models for comprehensive body motion and error analysis; (ii) multimodal instruction and feedback techniques; and (iii) applications for fitness training and rehab that demonstrate the new human-AI interaction paradigm. The AI agent and system designs will be evaluated by performing controlled experiments with users. The evaluation of this research project will be through three applications for: (1) physical fitness, (2) sports injury rehabilitation, and (3) facial paralysis rehabilitation. Implementations of parts of this research in play- and peer-based educational activities for middle and high school students will be designed to be interactive and engaging, while eliciting problem solving and critical thinking. The goal is to guide the next generation to think deeply about AI and its implications on human behavior and by extension, on society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These interactions control a wide range of processes with a direct impact on humanity, including near-surface climate variability, cloud formation and precipitation. Land-atmosphere processes remain a significant challenge in large-scale weather and climate prediction due to their inherent complexity and the trans-disciplinary approach required to study them. Likewise, human activities that shape terrestrial landscapes such as deforestation and agricultural production directly impact the atmosphere in which they exist, resulting in the feedback of land surface functioning onto the surface conditions that are experienced. These interactions are rooted in the structure and function of the vegetation-soil systems at the land surface, and the ecological responses of these systems to atmospheric forcing. This project will integrate the development of novel high-resolution computer modeling tools and data analytical approaches with the rich information on plant responses to climate developed over decades of field system manipulation experiments to advance our understanding of how land-atmosphere interactions will evolve over the coming decades. This CAREER project will contribute to the development of the next generation of scientists and engineers who are technically equipped and motivated to study complex environmental systems to enable a sustainable future. The broader impacts of this project combine inter-disciplinary training of students at the undergraduate, graduate and high school levels.<br/><br/>This award will advance our fundamental understanding of land-atmosphere interactions and feedback by: (1) developing high-fidelity 3D modeling tools for high-spatial and temporal resolution of land-atmosphere exchange processes and their consequent impacts on atmospheric development and land surface response; (2) utilizing new analytical approaches to diagnose land-atmosphere coupling and feedback in high resolution simulation output; (3) applying this new simulation platform to climate change scenarios across multiple vegetation and geographic domains. High resolution simulations of recent land-atmosphere interaction field campaigns will allow for validation of the simulation framework against observations of land-atmosphere carbon, water, energy and momentum fluxes, near surface climate variation, atmospheric boundary layer structure and cloud formation. Novel statistical tools will be used to quantify information flow, directionality and explicitly quantify feedback between surface and atmospheric states and fluxes. These tools will be used to analyze a suite of simulations designed to quantify the relative roles of vegetation structure, physiological and biochemical function, atmospheric state and the structure of the lower atmosphere on emergent land-atmosphere interactions and feedbacks. Overall this CAREER project will lead to a better understanding of how and why land-atmosphere interactions will change in the coming decades.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is in addition to the ongoing critical need to address long-standing problems in occupational safety, labor productivity, costs, and labor shortage. A promising technical solution is to introduce mobile robots on construction jobsites. It is possible to leverage recent discoveries in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle those aforementioned challenges. However, unlike manufacturing automation or self-driving cars, construction robots face unique challenges due to the need to navigate dynamic environments. Such robots are also required to work closely with humans in a variaty of tasks and often handle heavy payloads. This award supports fundamental robotics research to allow better perception and navigation for construction jobsite monitoring robots. It will produce an intelligent mobile robot team equipped with cameras to autonomously monitor construction progress and operations to improve jobsite efficiency and safety. The results of this research will be widely applicable to scenarios beyond construction, ranging from connected and autonomous vehicles to service robotics in smart and accessible cities. The project will facilitate collaboration between robotics, artificial intelligence, and civil and mechanical engineering. Furthermore, it aims to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering via educational games, multi-disciplinary robotics curriculum, and workforce training workshops.<br/><br/>Mobile robotics in construction jobsites are often limited by perception challenges due to occlusion and limited field of view. In dynamic jobsites, limited perception leads to navigation and inefficient assistance. To improve the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the vision system in mobile robots, novel self-supervised and graph-based representation learning will be used to extract, organize, and reason about places and objects from high-dimensional sensory inputs. This research will advance the state of the art  along three directions: (1) robust navigation from topological representations for monitoring in dynamic and ever-changing jobsites, (2) collaborative perception for  providing safer operation monitoring and collision warnings on busy jobsites, and (3) integrated perception and navigation at both the algorithm, system, and dataset levels. The research will be validated in real construction jobsites through industry partners, and the resulting software, hardware design, and dataset will be open source to stimulate future research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large fraction of our society now engages in social activity online on a regular basis, but the current centralization and homogenization of social activity onto platforms that provide only a small number of possible configurations is counter to enabling an inclusive society. People who do not conform to the majority must struggle against configurations that were not built with them in mind. For instance, users from marginalized backgrounds must contend with platform-wide content filters that cannot discriminate between harassing and non-harassing content targeted at them, while neurodiverse users have trouble retaining control over their social media usage. This research will have a significant impact on the social computing industry, and consequently, it will benefit millions of users on these platforms. The education and outreach plan will help future computer scientists to realize the social ramifications of the applications they build and engage students and the public in imagining alternative social media designs that improve society.<br/><br/>To achieve the goal of furthering inclusivity on these social platforms, this research will focus on learning from and designing for those who face the greatest challenges and barriers from current social media designs, such as journalists and content creators, neurodiverse users, and marginalized individuals who often face harassment. It will then develop new strategies to lower barriers for users to participate in social curation, so that anyone who does not have technical skills or lots of time to dedicate can still benefit. Empirically, this research will use a mixed-methods approach to gather a large dataset of curations that marginalized users would like to have for their social environment. It will make technical contributions through the building of novel techniques and collaborative systems that implement ways for users to perform desired curations using minimal effort or technical skills. In particular, it will investigate novel user affordances that embed small curation tasks into a user's everyday experience on social media, as well as collaborative models that allow groups of people to share or collectively build up custom configurations. Finally, it will build and release a flexible research toolkit that embeds the findings from the empirical work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This team will use data from the Large Millimeter Telescope and Subaru Telescope to map the distribution of galaxies and their molecular gas throughout most of the history of the universe. They will also establish a program at the UMass Amherst to provide research opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM fields.

By mapping degree-scale statistical populations of massive galaxies, the investigator will connect their environments from the Subaru Telescope/Prime Focus Spectrograph to their cold gas, as traced by dust using the TolTEC instrument on the Large Millimeter Telescope. By using the most sophisticated cosmological simulations to date that include the physics of dust formation, growth, and destruction, the investigator will further perform an apples-to-apples analysis of mock galaxies to understand systematics and calibrate observations. Through linking star formation and cold gas across diverse galaxy habitats, the investigator will develop a physical model explaining the key processes responsible for the assembly of early massive galaxies through to the present day.

However, our understanding  of cooperative interactions in the natural world has historically lagged behind the study of antagonistic interactions, such as competition and predation, perpetuating gaps in our ability to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function. This research focuses on a highly common, but relatively unexplored, cooperative interaction between North American trees and ?bodyguard? mites that live on leaves and protect plants against disease. This research asks why some tree species cooperate with mites as a form of defense, while other closely related tree species do not, testing a range of hypotheses about the factors that promote (or break down) cooperation in nature. This project will also include the development of a new science course that allows students to participate in research on cooperative interactions in plants and develop critical thinking skills through the study of trees. Together, the research and education goals of this proposal will result in publicly available data on economically and ecologically important North American trees, their herbivores, and the beneficial mites that protect them from pests and disease.  The project will also result in the hands-on training of young scientists, and will include the development of tools aimed at increasing the visibility of research in classrooms.<br/><br/>This research will examine processes driving large-scale patterns of variation in investment in plant-animal defense mutualisms. Specifically, the project will investigate the drivers of ecological, micro-, and macro-evolutionary variation in mite domatia (heritable plant structures that house predaceous and fungiviorous mites) at three scales: (a) across eastern North American forest communities, (b) within three genera (Viburnum, Vitis, and Prunus) and (c) within three geographically wide-spread species, Vitis riparia, Viburnum dentatum, and Prunus serotina. This evolutionary research is coupled with an educational plan that integrates data objectives with teaching/training goals through the development of a new mid-level non-majors course titled ?Seeing the forest and the trees: The Study of Trees through Science, Art, and Society.? The course will incorporate research activities into undergraduate education to enhance scientific literacy, and will be aimed at groups that have traditionally lacked exposure to science (non-science majors), combining humanities and science perspectives into a course focused on the study of trees. Together, the research and education aims will allow for tests of evolutionary and ecological signatures consistent with long-standing hypotheses about ecological drivers of mutualism across geography and evolutionary time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the popularity of air travel and the need for pilots in the aviation industry, becoming a pilot is a dream that most abandon after childhood, either in pursuit of other passions or because of its prohibitive initial investment in cost and time, resulting in a nationwide pilot shortage. This project will study skill transfer from VR-based simulation to the real world by evaluating the physical, functional, and cognitive characteristics of simulation which impact a trainee?s ability to learn efficiently and effectively, as applied to the flight training environment. This project will make flight more accessible as a career and field of study through the use of virtual reality flight simulators. Additionally, it will broaden participation in aviation-careers and interests through outreach activities at local airports and by providing future pilots with online modules to help them initiate their training. Flight simulation performance-based and emergency response competitions will allow those already in training to test their skills and educate them on using flight simulation for their own practice. This award will enhance flight training, resulting in reduced flight training accidents and decreased time to certification, thus improving our ability to respond to the pilot shortage.<br/><br/>This project will study skill transfer from virtual reality to the physical world by evaluating the physical, functional, and cognitive fidelity characteristics of simulation that impact a trainee pilot?s ability to learn efficiently and effectively. Two experiments will measure skill transfer. The first will train novice pilots completely in virtual reality and evaluate their abilities in the aircraft. The second will follow a group of pilots who are pursuing an instrument certificate throughout their training and complement their training with simulation scenarios on both traditional simulators and a virtual reality flight simulator. Complementing flight training with simulation will investigate the impact of virtual reality interventions on skill acquisition and mental workload management. The data collected through both experiments will be used to evaluate and validate the use of virtual reality in both research and training as an alternative to physical simulators. This work will collect flight data through on-board flight data recorders and simulation software, physiological data through eye tracking and heart rate monitoring, and psychometric data through mobile surveys. Scoring algorithms will detect and evaluate human performance on a series of maneuvers. This project will advance our understanding of how humans learn in complex virtual reality environments such as flight training, validating virtual reality systems as a training device option, and therefore reducing the cost and time of highly advanced training in fields, which require the use of multiple skills simultaneously. The research will identify which types of skills transfer, use data-driven metrics to measure skill acquisition and transfer, validate the use of eye tracking and hear rate metrics in virtual reality, and develop a framework to assess modern simulators based on how they address learning outcomes, informing policy and regulation. The integration of education and research in this proposal is focused on a three-level approach: (i) creating interest through outreach activities; (ii) empowering actions through online training modules and the use of VR-based flight simulation; (iii) advancing training through self-practice and semi-annual competitive flight simulation events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It was Newton who unveiled the laws governing gravitational attraction, who proved that white light is actually a mixture of unaltered spectral colors, and who co-discovered the branch of mathematics that today we call calculus.  And yet it was the same Isaac Newton who spent countless hours in his laboratory over a period of some forty years reading and testing the theories of the alchemical adepts.  Newton?s passion for alchemy raises serious questions and puzzles for the modern mind.  What were his aims in pursuing the transmutation of metals, a goal that has since been discredited by modern science?  Was Newton?s alchemy a reaction to the extreme rationalism of his more mainstream pursuits, or was it somehow part of his overall scientific project?  Do Newton?s alchemical laboratory notebooks bear witness to the same experimental rigor as his other writings on optics, for example, display?  And why did Newton persist in an endeavor that from today?s perspective could only terminate in failure, for four decades - what products did his laboratory yield that might have led him to believe that success lay around the corner?  <br/><br/>The present project builds on nearly two decades of previous editorial experience to complete the digital edition of Newton?s ?chymical? (alchemical/chymical) works in an online, freely available format.  The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project (www.chymistry.org) hosted by Indiana University under the general editorship of William R. Newman, has edited about three-quarters of Newton?s alchemical known alchemical manuscripts, and will complete the task with the funding provided by this grant. The project will also provide bibliographical and advanced searching aids to the user, along with the results of digital tools for ordering the manuscripts chronologically.  As a result, end-users will be able to see for themselves how one of the greatest minds in history employed alchemy as a tool of discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bioelectronic medicines are neurotechnology devices that read and modulate the electrical activity of the body?s nervous system to control, regulate, or restore function. Medical care that uses these devices to continuously monitor physiological biomarkers and autonomously deliver therapy will significantly reduce clinician burden, improve patient compliance, and reduce adverse drug reactions and abuse. However, current bioelectronic medicine devices are too large to target small nerves for effective therapy, deliver indiscriminate stimulation on large nerves resulting in significant off-target effects, and lack the sophistication for closed-loop, automated processing. This project will address these issues through key innovations in circuit design, system development, and closed-loop control.

Next generation versions of these technologies require ordered two-dimensional structures that have direction-dependent organization.  In this project, the research team will investigate a new approach to creating such ordered assemblies of particles using stretched polymer spheres, termed ?ellipsoids?. Such particles irreversibly pin to air-water interfaces to conveniently create a two-dimensional layer; however, forces between the particles cause disorganized assemblies to form.  This hurdle will be overcome in this project by engineering the interactions between the particles through novel particle synthesis techniques that give the particle surface a controlled degree of roughness.  The project will focus on how particle roughness can be designed to dictate the forces between the particles and lead to their ultimate ordered assembly at the air-water interface. By doing this fundamental science, the foundational paradigm to develop two-dimensional materials applicable to a variety of fields, including plasmonics, solar photovoltaics, coatings, membranes, and biosensors, will be established. In addition, several educational and outreach activities are integrated into the project. Undergraduate students from local community colleges will be exposed to opportunities in STEM by recruitment for summer research experiences. The PI will also develop active learning workshops for middle and high school students aimed at increasing interest in STEM fields by exposing students to the exciting real-world applications of particles at interfaces. <br/><br/>The project will investigate how nanoscale surface topography (roughness or porosity) dictates the capillary interactions and assembly of anisotropic polymer ellipsoidal particles at fluid interfaces. This work is motivated by the plethora of novel materials (e.g., antireflective coatings, synthetic membranes, hierarchical surfaces, biomimetic materials) enabled from the two-dimensional ordering of anisotropic colloids.  However, strong capillary attraction between particles at fluid interfaces dooms anisotropic particle assembly.  The central hypothesis is that the capillary forces can be tuned by altering the curvature of the fluid interface surrounding pinned microparticles through the rational design of particles with controlled porosity or roughness. The research team seeks to apply a novel synthetic approach to create polymer ellipsoids with tunable roughness and porosity, quantitatively characterize the capillary interactions between such particles, and ultimately control the microstructural organization of particles whose detrimental capillary interactions have effectively been ?cloaked? via their surface topography. First, seeded emulsion polymerization will be used to create biphasic, chemically patchy polymer colloids which can be transformed into rough and porous ellipsoids. Second, the capillary interaction energy between particles will be determined via a combination of monitoring two-particle approach profiles and using Mirau interferometry to measure undulations in particle-liquid contact line with nanometer scale precision. Finally, ordered assemblies will be created using particles with promising interaction energies.  By linking the nanoscale particle surface characteristics with interfacial interactions, we will be able to identify design principles for nanoscale surface topography that minimize (i.e., ?cloak?) strong capillary interactions to unlock ordered 2D microstructures comprised of anisotropic particles.    These well-defined and otherwise inaccessible monolayer assemblies are directly relevant to applications in the fields of energy harvesting, photonics, particle-stabilized emulsions, biological interfaces, membranes, and/or hierarchical materials.  The project will include the development of active learning workshops focused on interfacial materials and self-assembly concepts for K-12 educators and school-aged children, as well as expanding access to engineering research opportunities for underrepresented groups through coordination with local community colleges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We do so through a process called structural generalization: we divide the sentence into smaller parts, interpret the meaning of each part, and then put these meanings together to interpret the full sentence. Current language technologies, such as the virtual assistants installed on many mobile phones, are not always able to generate meaning in this way. This leads them to make mistakes when they are expected to understand more complex commands; these mistakes may be more common in languages that are spoken by smaller communities. The researchers involved in this project will create tests in multiple languages in order to measure a computational system?s structural generalization capabilities, and will use those tests to teach the system to generalize correctly. This will result in systems that work more reliably and across a wider range of languages. Alongside its technological contribution, this project will help train a new generation of scientists that are well-versed in both artificial intelligence and  the structure and diversity of human languages. The project will also draw new populations to the field through outreach events that will introduce students interested in language to artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the researchers will create both expert-designed and real-world semantic parsing tasks ? mappings from natural language utterances to a formal language that captures their meaning ? which will span a diverse sample of languages. In the expert-designed tasks, natural language inputs will be generated from a grammar created by a linguist, and the outputs will be lambda calculus formulas computed from the input. The distribution of linguistic structures will differ systematically between the training and test set of each task (?structural splits?). The structural splits of the expert-designed task will be used to endow artificial neural networks, such as large language models, with an inductive bias that favors structural generalization; such an inductive bias will then lead to structural generalization on real-world tasks. This will be accomplished using a meta-learning approach, whose objective is to learn from one part of the split and generalize to the other. These behavioral experiments will be accompanied by an investigation of how the network?s internal properties, such as initial weights, training dynamics and loss landscape, give rise to structural generalization. Overall, by providing tools for measuring and promoting structural generalization across languages, this project will lead to more robust and sample-efficient language understanding systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most natural sediment, such as mud and fine sand, inevitably harbors microbial biofilms. Biofilms have been shown to alter the threshold and rate of sediment transport by up to 40-fold. However, predictive sediment transport equations that account for the impacts of biofilms are lacking. A key challenge in developing such predictive equations is that the transport of sediment at macroscale (> 1 m) is controlled by biofilms at micro (10^-6 to 10^-3 m) to mesoscale (10^-3 to 10^-1 m). This study aims to combine micro- to mesoscale flow-cell and imaging technology with macroscale flume experiments to quantify the impacts of micro- to mesoscale biofilms on macroscale sediment transport. Predictive equations for biofilm-bound sediment transport will be developed. The results of this study will help improve predictions of coastal and riverine erosion, which will guide future coastal and riverine restoration projects, and support better predictions and control of the spread of biofilm-bound particulate contaminants. In addition, multiscale hands-on educational activities based on the proposed research will be developed and integrated into teaching, mentoring, K12 education, and public outreach. These activities will introduce the essence of the research to a diverse range of young learners, including female and Native American students. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to (1) quantify the impacts of sediment size and hydrodynamic conditions on the properties of micro- to mesoscale biofilms on sediment surfaces; (2) predict the macroscale transport of suspended microscale biofilm-sediment aggregates; (3) predict the onset of bedload transport for sediment covered with mesoscale biofilm mats. Systematically controlled experiments with submicron resolution confocal microscopic imaging will be conducted in microfluidic flow cells to visualize and quantify the development of micro- to mesoscale biofilms on sediment surfaces and the formation of biofilm-sediment aggregates. Flume experiments combined with digital imaging, tensile tests, rheometer measurements, hydrodynamic measurements, and topographic measurements will be conducted to quantify the impacts of biofilms with varying morphological and rheological properties on macroscale sediment transport. The results from both microfluidic and flume experiments will be used to develop predictive equations for the transport of suspended biofilm-sediment aggregates and biofilm mat-covered bedload.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ordinary tattoo pigments, which have been implanted in human skin for millennia using the simplest of tools, are nanoparticles. However, the modern tools of nanotechnology have scarcely been brought to bear on tattoo pigment nanoparticles, despite the widespread popularity of tattoos among the United States population, over a quarter of which is tattooed. Many different nanoscale sensors and devices are now available.  The skin, as the most external organ, offers an optimal site for implanting them, especially when they might confer new biomedical benefits such as the ability to sense and monitor vital health factors. The opportunity to replace tattoo pigments with functional nano-biosensors, as well as the general lack of fundamental knowledge on the safety of ordinary tattoo pigments, motivates the need for more research on the biocompatibility of nanoparticles implanted in the skin. This project will combine the tools of nanotechnology with a model to understand how to design and create skin nano-implants that are as safe, hypo-allergenic, and biocompatible as possible. Education and outreach efforts will integrate this research into a unique art-meets-science workshop and other public outreach activities designed to broaden participation and enhance diversity in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This hypothesis-driven investigation will establish fundamental knowledge on how nanoparticle size, composition, surface chemistry, density, and stiffness affect biocompatibility. In order to characterize the structure-property-biocompatibility relationships in intradermal nanoparticles, the research team will (i) create a library of nanoparticles with systematic variations in size, composition, density, and stiffness, (ii) implant these nanoparticles in murine dermal tissue, and (iii) characterize biocompatibility in vivo with respect to acute and chronic immunogenicity, toxicity, and biodistribution. It is hypothesized that larger, denser nanoparticles will minimize migration, while softer nanoparticles will be less pro-inflammatory by mimicking the mechanics of native tissue. It is also hypothesized that inert polymer coatings may provide a general way to improve biocompatibility by passivating immunogenic surfaces. These hypotheses will be tested by comparing assays for inflammation, geno- and phototoxicity, and biodistribution in vivo among hairless mice (as a human skin surrogate) implanted with different nanoparticles in the library. These studies will produce critical insights needed to establish general guidelines that ensure the safety of both ordinary tattoo pigments and the next generation of intradermal biomedical nano-implants.

For rural households with young children, these shocks are becoming increasingly important as incomes and prices change unpredictably due to pandemics, wars, and climates change. This research builds on an on-going field experiment to study how responsive food preferences are to changes in price and income among women with young children and how outside information on nutrition alters these preferences. The focus is on understanding whether providing nutritional information in addition to income support leads to better nutritional choices than providing income support alone.  The results of this research will improve the design of social protection programs, such as the bundle of services to provide, and the optimal size of support.  Besides helping researchers to model the economic impacts of adverse shocks, the results will also help improve the efficiency of social support programs, thus improving the wellbeing of low-income people as well reducing the fiscal burden of such programs.

The project design allows the PIs to also test whether providing nutritional information in addition to income support improves nutritional outcomes relative to only income support.

Hegemonic narratives have sought to obfuscate not only the contemporary existence of non-normative sexual experiences in certain national contexts, but also aimed to bury any historical traces of non-normative forms of gender and sexuality. This dissertation project documents the history and shifting perceptions of sexual diversity and explores how and why attitudes toward this diversity were historically transformed in different national contexts.<br/><br/>By conducting archival research to examine the pre-colonial to post-colonial periods, the project aims to answer the following questions: (1) How did the historical ?otherizing? of non-normative sexuality take shape and contributed to the marginalization of those ?others?? (2) How did the ?otherizing? depend (or not) on the widely accepted thesis surrounding the emergence and translation of ?medicalized? understandings of sexuality in the nineteenth century? (3) In a colonial and post-colonial context, how did certain forms of sexual expression become criminalized? (4) How did the structural marginalization of certain types of sexuality manifest itself and impact public health of e.g., populations impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic?

Many self-assembly and signal transduction processes in both biological and synthetic systems are implemented through the reaction and diffusion of molecules. For example, proteins collude together in signaling cascades to detect stimuli and transduce that detection into a desired response. While there has been great progress both in understanding natural systems and in engineering synthetic ones, chemical reaction networks (CRNs) continue to pose a challenge, particularly when accounting for random fluctuations characteristic to the molecular scale.  Currently, repeated noisy simulations can be combined to assess how fast-timescale events (individual reactions and diffusive steps) build together to generate slow-timescale responses. Dr. Gingrich and his research group will utilize a mathematical construction called a tensor network (TN) to pursue computational approaches that yield novel methods to analyze CRNs without the need for many repeated simulations. The work will result in disseminated computer code, which will also form the basis for two educational web-based simulation modules about fluctuations in chemical kinetics.<br/><br/>Connecting microscopic interactions with emergent macroscopic phenomena is a central challenge of statistical mechanics. In chemical kinetics, this challenge manifests in the nonequilibrium spatio-temporal patterns which emerge from a balance between chemical reactions and diffusion. Subtle changes in the kinetic interactions between species in CRNs can sensitively impact the patterns that emerge, e.g., oscillatory chemical clocks, Turing patterns, and cellular signal transduction. The Gingrich team will develop, characterize, optimize, and ultimately apply a new computational method to study the sensitivity of patterns to the microscopic kinetic model. The research program will combine analytical techniques known as the Doi-Peliti (DP) framework with mature computational methods for TN many-body problems to offer an alternative perspective to kinetics problems which are routinely attacked through Monte Carlo sampling alone. An accompanying educational plan will use web simulations to teach aspects of stochastic kinetics, with one module targeting undergraduates and another targeting graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These needs are documented as the ""requirements"" for the system. Thus, requirements engineering (RE) is the term used to describe the techniques and methods deployed to capture and concretely define users' needs. Software industry experts and academics agree that accurate and well-defined requirements are essential for the development of quality software; however, the rate of adoption of RE techniques is still low among practitioners and RE is still considered separately from software design and development. One of the objectives of this project is to create a framework that integrates RE techniques with development activities (e.g., coding, testing).  By linking requirements with the documentation of development activities, researchers make it easier for developers to engage with the requirements for their project, to ensure that software developers remain faithful to the original goals and needs of their user base. While this framework will apply to all software development, this project focuses on the low-computation needs of small and independent software companies. Further, the project is designed to simultaneously improve both the teaching and practice of RE, as there are not enough individuals trained in RE, even with the expansion of the software workforce. A second objective of this project is to create educational methods that embed requirements within development activities in the classroom. By empowering future software developers with better access to the requirements they implement, this award aims to increase the adoption of RE by practitioners and students. Through this project, the participation of women in computer science will be increased by supporting and mentoring 20-30 female undergraduates.<br/><br/>The scientific objective of this award is to explore to what extent streamlining requirements management into existing development workflows will improve students' engagement with requirements in the classroom and achieve greater adoption of RE approaches among the software workforce. Researchers will create a framework that integrates software requirements into normal software development activities. This framework will be realized through the development of an open-source git-based solution consisting of three functions: importing and parsing natural language requirements, creating traceability links between requirements and git issues and pull requests, and engaging developers in a feedback loop to evaluate the requirement traces.  The the resulting tool will create appropriate nudges for just-in-time checking of specification documents and validation of software changes. This project promises to improve practices in the field of requirements traceability and parsing by seeking a computationally efficient approach for incrementally creating traceability links between requirements and git development artifacts. The project will advance the field of requirements engineering education by embedding requirements within development activities in the classroom. Researchers will measure the impact of requirements considerations in the students' development process and the rate of students? voluntary use of requirements to establish the effectiveness of RE activities and their impacts on software quality. By iteratively studying course projects, researchers will fine tune the git-based framework and mitigate any weaknesses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When the Earth and our planet neighbors are viewed within the Solar System today, we see only a snapshot of their full lifetimes. In order to put this snapshot in context, the investigator would like to understand their long-term histories, or how they got to be the way they are today. On worlds, like Earth, that have active geology (plate tectonics, volcanism etc), the signatures that we might use to study their past have been erased. Measurements of chemical elements with slightly different masses provide a rare opportunity to study the more distant histories of planets. With new telescopes, these measurements are only now becoming possible for the outer part of the Solar System. The investigator and her research group will use new telescope observations study the evolution of Solar System moons and dwarf planets. By combining these observations with models, this work will advance understanding of the heat flow and mass loss histories of these worlds. The program will involve students from undergraduate to PhD level, as well as postdoctoral scholars. It will additionally train young scientists in producing innovative, interactive science content for the public, tailored to a range of settings.<br/><br/>This project applies established techniques in isotope geochemistry to geologically-active moons observed with astronomical methods, thus bridging the disciplines of astronomy, geology, and geochemistry. It will specifically provide insight into: the longevity of tidal heating at the galilean satellites; the mass loss and surface-interior exchange processes at Enceladus; and the formation and migration histories of captured moons. The project will utilize new observations from the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array, which will be interpreted using models that will consider all isotope reservoirs and exchange rates for the relevant species, enabling robust bounds on formation and evolutionary scenarios. The results will address fundamental open questions about these objects, and will establish the abiotic isotope background for Solar System moons, an important first step towards using isotopes as biosignatures.<br/><br/>Co-funding was provided by the Division of Astronomy and Division of Earth Sciences through a partnership focused on Geoscience Lessons for and from Other Worlds (GLOW).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vulnerable communities often endure multiple such harms simultaneously. These layered environmental inequalities lead to serious inequalities in illness, quality of life, and life expectancy. This study will examine government agencies? use of cumulative impact assessment for environmental justice (CIAEJ) to improve quality of life in these overburdened, vulnerable, and underserved communities. This study aims to strengthen government agencies? abilities to reduce environmental inequalities and foster environmental justice (EJ) by identifying agency practices that are most effective toward this end and the conditions that foster them. In addition to providing substantial graduate student training in methods of empirical data collection and analysis, the project findings will be shared to scientists, government agencies, EJ advocates, and the broader public through academic publications, invited presentations, formal comments at public hearings, and the PI?s participation in agency EJ advisory councils.<br/><br/>This three-year, empirical study will examine the ways three environmental regulatory agencies are currently applying CIAEJ techniques into environmental permit review. Data will be gathered from agency documents, public comments on these initiatives, confidential interviews with agency staff and external stakeholders, and observation of agency meetings. This project will advance scientific knowledge in STS, political ecology, and EJ studies by identifying social factors shaping the use of CIAEJ within regulatory decision-making, and analyses will focus on how bureaucrats determine what counts as risk, and how different contexts and creative bureaucratic practices may foster social justice reforms through regulatory agency practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent estimates suggest that in some metropolitan areas as many as half of new housing units are built without permits. Although these informal units provide a much-needed supply of housing in high-cost metropolitan areas where there is a severe unmet demand for affordable housing, they can also pose important health and safety risks to residents and exacerbate inequalities regarding access to adequate and safe housing and infrastructure. This project examines local governments? efforts to address non-compliance with land use and housing laws by documenting the ways in which land use regulation itself or its discretionary enforcement contributes to the proliferation of informal housing. It will address the needs of socially vulnerable communities by conducting social and legal research on understudied forms of informal housing where evidence suggests a disproportionate share of low-income and racial/ethnic minority residents live. It will inform more equitable policymaking and planning through project publications and reports and will improve legal and social science education by training graduate students in qualitative and quantitative analysis of informal housing. Lastly, it will advance broader understandings of the importance and implications of informal housing by developing and distributing case studies for inclusion in undergraduate and graduate sociology, law, urban planning, and public policy courses.<br/><br/>This study advances science and builds on two important socio-legal traditions ? the disconnection between law-on-the-books and law-in-action, and legal consciousness ? by examining the efficacy of and challenges to land use and housing law; interrogating the state?s approach to and capacity for enforcement in the context of widespread non-compliance; identifying myriad challenges to governance and implications for inequality posed by the proliferation of informal housing; and examining the role of power and legitimacy in the implementation and enforcement of law in the context of land use and housing. To do so, it uses quantitative data at both the national and local levels to examine the relationship between the production of informal housing units, the local regulatory environment, and local expenditures on code enforcement. It also examines the dynamics of law, enforcement, discretion, and legitimacy in the context of widespread housing informality. It does so by documenting how public officials such as planners, code enforcement officers, or zoning appeal boards negotiate the demands and dilemmas of public service through discretionary decisions; how producers and users of housing conform to or transgress laws; and the ways they make sense of the legality of informal housing. In doing so, the project will elucidate the mechanisms by which the translation of housing laws (?in action?) produces informal housing units, and how cultural interpretations of housing laws and norms confer legitimacy that contributes to their persistence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include modern wireless communication networks (e.g., based on 5G/6G, mmWave/THz technologies), drone swarms, mobile or robotic networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), self-driving cars, and the Internet of Things (IoT). While WANS and their applications present a high potential for societal and economic growth, the operation of such systems requires not only to be efficient and driven by actual, observable data but also to meet often strict design specifications. These specifications are induced by the need to maintain performance robustness and resilience, which, in turn, translates into latency, reliability, fairness, and trustworthiness guarantees. Such criteria and constraints are fundamentally connected to intrinsic risks associated with the operation of wireless systems; those risks are due to inherent uncertainties caused by naturally occurring phenomena such as nontrivial statistical dispersion of the wireless medium as well as randomness in the behavior of multiple users and devices, often with complex and heterogeneous features and objectives. This project puts forward a new principled methodological framework for systematic risk-aware resource allocation in wireless systems, bridging the operational gap between ergodic risk neutrality and minimax conservativeness. The investigation focuses not only on formulation and dual-domain variational analysis of new constrained risk-aware resource-allocation problems but also on the development of theory as well as efficient methods for both model-based synthesis and model-free reinforcement learning of optimal risk-aware policies. It is expected that this work will establish a new paradigm in wireless systems resource allocation.<br/><br/>Preliminary results on basic stylized resource-allocation problems - as simple as single-user power-constrained rate maximization - demonstrate clear advantages of risk-aware policies against both their ergodic (i.e., risk-neutral) and minimax counterparts. However, obtaining optimal risk-aware policies in more realistic and useful settings is nontrivial: in risk-aware problems, the role of expectations is played by more general functionals, called risk measures, for which fundamental properties of expectation - such as linearity, homogeneity, or the tower property - are generally absent. Such complications are naturally amplified within a constrained optimization setup. This project concentrates on such risk-aware problems within the context of constrained resource allocation for wireless systems and is divided into three main thrusts: 1) Lagrangian duality in risk-aware resource allocation, 2) model-based data-driven synthesis of risk-aware resource-allocation policies and 3) model-free learning of risk-aware resource-allocation policies. The principal investigator anticipates that the project will be instrumental in ameliorating inherent challenges under the risk-aware setting, such as the presence of risk-measure-based variational stochastic constraints, infinite dimensionality of resource policies, nonconvexity of random services, and channel/system-model availability, ultimately rendering risk-aware wireless-system resource allocation an intellectually accessible and computationally affordable task. The project will also be relevant to several areas beyond wireless autonomy - such as finance, economics, energy, and robotics - and may trigger new developments in the intersection of communications, information theory, statistics, and optimization, as well as inspire new tools in risk-aware and constrained learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much work has investigated hurricane intensification, but comparatively little effort has been invested in studying hurricanes that weaken while still over the ocean despite public perception of expected impacts being tied to hurricane category, such as Hurricane Florence in 2018. This project will explore the nature of hurricanes that weaken away from land, as well as characteristics of the near-storm environment, to quantify how over-ocean weakening varies across all tropical basins. The research will then investigate hurricanes that weaken on approach to land in order to evaluate how nearby land modifies these weakening pathways and facilitate advances in forecasting such events. Open-source programming tools developed by this project will be shared to ensure scientific transparency and expand accessibility to more users.<br/><br/>Vertical wind shear can weaken a tropical cyclone, yet a range of shear magnitudes is associated with tropical cyclone weakening. Enhanced atmospheric moisture supports deep convection, but the location of this enhanced moisture relative to the storm center appears to affect the storm?s intensity. To interrogate the physical processes responsible for tropical cyclone weakening in these varied environments, this study will assess the spatial distribution of near-storm environmental characteristics and the relative timing of changes in those characteristics within a storm-relative framework for over-ocean weakening events in all tropical basins. The latest global reanalysis will be investigated for environmental fields, and spatial assessment of convection and its evolution over time?revealed by geostationary infrared imagery?will highlight the tropical cyclone?s response to its environment. Beyond advancing fundamental understanding of these storms, this project will craft a tropical cyclone analysis toolkit comprised of open-source Python tools to accelerate time-to-science for the broader research community.

Due to its importance to habitability and modern technical infrastructure, it is critical to understand how Earth?s magnetic field has varied through Earth?s past, in addition to how it might change in the future. To do this, it is necessary to characterize the spatial and temporal variations of the magnetic field using paleomagnetism, in which ancient records of the field are measured from rocks. Due to a sparsity of paleomagnetic data and gaps in paleomagnetic education and training, our ability to understand past behavior and predict future behavior is hampered. This project aims to improve the characterization of geomagnetic field behavior by filling in important data gaps in the current paleomagnetic record using a novel recorder of geomagnetic field behavior, clinkers, or rocks baked and burned by coal seam fires from the Powder River Basin, USA. This aim will be further enhanced through the development of a new paleomagnetism general education course and experiential learning research experience on clinkers as part of the University of Florida?s (UF) Quest program, and the development of a paleomagnetism-focused workshop for high-school age 4-H club members as a part of UF Extension Services? program, 4-H University. These programs will educate a broad audience in the fields of paleomagnetism and Earth Science, while simultaneously attracting new students to Earth Science degrees, paleomagnetic research, and ultimately the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Despite being a fundamental feature of our planet, our understanding of Earth?s magnetic field is incomplete. Currently, there are many gaps in the state of knowledge including: 1) what drives the magnetic field? 2) what causes magnetic reversals? and 3) how does the magnetic field vary spatially? These gaps in knowledge are further exacerbated by an education gap. Paleomagnetism can provide insight into multiple geoscience disciplines, yet as a topic it typically receives little attention in geoscience training. This impacts the ability of the geoscience community to understand paleomagnetic research in addition to the ability to fill in critical gaps in understanding of the magnetic field. What is needed to fill in these critical gaps is both more high-quality full-vector (direction and intensity) paleomagnetic data in addition to a trained workforce to collect and analyze these data. The aim of this project is to fill these needs by improving the characterization of recent (0?5 Myr) geomagnetic field behavior using a novel recorder of geomagnetic field behavior, clinkers. Clinkers, rocks baked and burned by coal seam fires, are an exciting new candidate for obtaining high-quality full-vector magnetic records as they occur throughout the world, are located in regions lacking magnetic data, can be reliably dated, and are reliable full-vector magnetic recorders. In this project, state-of-the-art paleomagnetic and geochronologic techniques will be utilized, generating a semi-continuous, high-resolution, full-vector record of magnetic field variations for Quaternary to Pliocene (0?5 Myr) age clinker deposits from the Powder River Basin (PRB), USA. This research is the first step in building a reliable methodology to expand work on clinker deposits outside of the PRB. The education and outreach components of this project will train the next generation of paleomagnetists and broaden the understanding of paleomagnetic research within the geosciences and the general population. This project is an early step in a continuum of research and education that will lead to an improved global characterization of the magnetic field. More generally, this project addresses science priority question one, ?How is Earth?s internal field generated??, released in the National Academies decadal report for NSF-EAR.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural applications of this kind of Partially Observable RL (PORL) include robotics, autonomous driving, imperfect information games, resource allocation under partial information, planetary exploration, medical diagnostic systems. As such, PORL has been an important topic in operation research, control, and machine learning. While the community recently witnessed a surge of breakthroughs in reinforcement learning theory in fully observable environments, our understanding of learning to act in partially observable systems remains very limited. Partial observability brings a new series of unique challenges to RL in modeling, algorithm design, and theoretical analyses. Resolving these challenges will have far-reaching impacts in academia, industry and society where modern RL can be applied.<br/><br/>This project aims to identify and attack these unique challenges, establish solid theoretical foundations, and design new reliable and efficient algorithms for PORL. Concretely, this proposal will study PORL in three progressive thrusts. Thrust 1 considers the basic tabular setup, under the model of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The main objective in this thrust is to identify the key structural conditions that permit statistically or computationally efficient learning, and to address the core challenges of inferring latent states and exploration. Thrust 2 concerns modern PORL with an enormous number of states and observations, where function approximation must be deployed to approximate the models, the value functions, or the policies. We will investigate these problems under a more general model of Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and develop efficient learning results in the presence of function approximation.

This is up from one-in-11 in 2019. Thus, older adults are a growing demographic group in society. Because aging is related to increased healthcare utilization, as are pandemics, this increasing demographic translates into the need to increase the workforce in healthcare. The rising demand for healthcare can be combated by deploying activity monitoring systems, which could help monitor the health status of older patients and support the early detection of health issues. Thus, building such monitoring systems requires an automated understanding of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) performed by humans. Most of the investigations towards modeling human activities owing to the advances in computer vision are targeted for generic internet videos. Existing models are fabricated for recognition in web videos whereas viewpoint variation and subtle motion that characterize ADLs generally cannot handle uncertainty and tend to underperform in real-world scenarios. Moreover, they have difficulties distinguishing similarly looking activities. Thus, the key objective of this project is to build a framework for recognizing ADLs that can be deployed in monitoring systems. The project will also perform complementary educational and outreach activities that engage STEM students.<br/><br/>This project will develop a multi-modal framework predominantly based on the RGB color model and pose modalities due to their easy accessibility in indoor scenarios. This framework aims at addressing two important challenges - the limited availability of labeled ADL videos and how to combine different heterogeneous modalities (RGB and Poses) for classifying activities. Thus, this project will explore the integration of two interrelated research directions: (1) a study on learning from limited training distribution; and, (2) a study on combining modalities like RGB and depth.  In the first study, the project will explore the possibilities of mitigating the limitation of the scale of available data in the ADL domain for effective training of neural networks for video understanding. In the second study, the team will aim at improving the effectiveness of RGB-based human activity recognition by leveraging the human localized regions within a scene. Finally, we will develop a multi-modal neural network model for ADL by integrating human localized RGB and 3D poses of a human actor.

Students will engage in discussions that consider the privacy implications of using data-fueled services, applications, and technologies and critically evaluate how their personal data is being used. During and after the project, instructors and students will have opportunities to connect with industry partners who work with biosensing and wearable technologies, and to access career and college readiness resources relevant to these and related data technology fields.<br/><br/>This project will study how interactive and multimodal data engagement tools, grounded in relatable Quantified Self experiences, can support students? learning and engagement with and about data, (neuro)biology, and bioinformatics. To achieve this, the project will design tools and materials in collaboration with teachers using a culturally responsive, participatory design approach, to ensure that the project activities will appeal to a range of students' interests and that it will promote equity of participation in STEM education. The project will also examine how industry/mentor partnerships and an online platform can help learners contextualize their own cognition and behavior within population-wide patterns and build awareness of careers in data science, biology, and bioinformatics. Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, and student work artifacts. The analysis approach will include both qualitative and quantitative approaches to understand the impact of the project on student learning and engagement. This project addresses the pervasive challenges of building data and science literacy, increasing participation in STEM/ICT fields, and promoting equity in STEM/ICT workforce and career preparation. By engaging students in creating novel, multimodal data representations and evaluating their own data, the project aims to empower them to use data and science as tools for generating knowledge about issues that concern them and to consider careers in data-related fields. The project anticipates reaching 25 teachers, 15 mentors, and 400-600 students within the project term, and more via an open-source software and curriculum. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent times, the mathematical study of collective dynamics has become an active and fast-growing field of research. Many mathematical models of collective behavior rely on partial differential equations with nonlocal interactions to describe the resulting emergent behavior. It turns out that these models are intimately connected to other models traditionally used in fluid dynamics. The goal of this project is to study several models of nonlocal partial differential equations to model collective behavior or fluid flows, and to develop novel and robust analytical techniques to understand the collective behaviors driven by nonlocal structures. The training and professional development of graduate students and young researchers is an integral part of the project.<br/> <br/>This project studies three families of partial differential equations with shared nonlocal structures that can affect the solutions of the equations: existence, uniqueness, regularity, and long-time asymptotic behaviors. The first problem is on the compressible Euler system with nonlinear velocity alignment, which describes the remarkable flocking phenomenon in animal swarms. Global phenomena and asymptotic behaviors of the system will be investigated, with a focus on the nonlinearity in the velocity alignment. The second problem is on the pressureless Euler system, aiming at the long-standing question of the uniqueness of weak solutions. The plan is to approximate the system by the relatively well-studied Euler-alignment system in collective dynamics. The third problem is on the Euler-Monge-Ampre system which is closely related to the incompressible Euler equations in fluid dynamics. The embedded nonlocal geometric structure of the system will be explored, with interesting applications in optimal transport and mean-field games.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the increasing complexity and the proprietary nature of ML models make it rather challenging for stakeholders to understand the behavior of these models. Consequently, several methods have been proposed in recent years to explain the behavior of ML models in a human-interpretable fashion. These methods, however, adopt vastly different strategies to explain model behavior and often contradict each other. The increasing diversity of these explanation methods, coupled with the lack of systematic evaluation frameworks, have made it impossible to determine which methods are likely to be effective across different kinds of critical real-world applications. This project will build rigorous frameworks for systematically analyzing, evaluating, and comparing the reliability and utility of various state-of-the-art explanation methods across different real-world applications. The frameworks developed as part of this project have the potential to significantly accelerate the adoption of ML models in a variety of settings, including healthcare (e.g., patient treatment recommendations), lending (e.g., loan approval decisions), and hiring (e.g., resume screening). <br/><br/><br/>This project aims to systematically characterize existing explanation methods so that practitioners can readily determine which methods to employ in a given real-world application. The project will focus on the following subtasks: 1) developing novel theoretical and empirical frameworks to analyze how reliably various state-of-the-art methods explain the behavior of different types of ML models (e.g., linear vs. non-linear models), 2) conducting large-scale user studies with domain experts in healthcare, lending, and hiring to evaluate the utility of existing explanation methods across different high-stakes applications, 3) leveraging the data obtained from the aforementioned user studies to build algorithmic agents which can mimic the behavior of domain experts, and employing these agents to, in turn, evaluate the utility of explanation methods at scale, and 4) developing novel algorithmic frameworks which can automatically select an appropriate explanation method tailored to a given real-world context.  With these contributions, this research will pave the way for a clearer understanding and a broader consensus on which explanation methods are likely to effectively explain the behavior of different ML models across various high-stakes applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Methods for addressing these prediction or estimation questions frequently rely on suitable mathematical models often combined with measurement data. Here challenging issues arise in the form of unavoidable errors or uncertainties in both model and measurements, as well as a limited understanding of the underlying theoretical properties of the model. All such challenges are severely amplified in complex physical systems due to the presence of a large number of degrees of freedom. This project aims to advance rigorous understanding of these problems and develop new techniques in the context of high-dimensional complex systems, particularly arising in fluid dynamics applications. Specifically, the following topics will be addressed: recovery of missing physical parameters from sparse and noisy observations; long-time behavior of stochastically forced models; and investigation of finite-time singularity formation of certain deterministic hydrodynamic models. The research will be integrated with several educational activities to promote learning and professional development opportunities for students and the organization of a workshop on statistical sampling, with participation from both academia and industry. <br/><br/>The research component of this project is subdivided into the following specific projects: 1) Bayesian inverse PDE problems and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This project will expand on a developing theory of MCMC algorithms on general state spaces, including the development of new algorithms and rigorous convergence results. These will be applied in the recovery of infinite-dimensional physical quantities from sparse and noisy data as described by a Bayesian inverse PDE problem, in the context of various fluid dynamics examples. 2) Mixing rates for stochastic PDEs and weak convergence of associated numerical approximations. The PI will show Wasserstein contraction for the Markovian semigroup associated to several stochastic fluid models, a result that implies exponential mixing rates as well as uniqueness of the associated invariant measure. The PI will also consider suitable numerical discretizations of these models and show uniform in time weak convergence and asymptotic numerical bias estimates. 3) Analysis of locally self-similar singularity scenarios in hydrodynamic models. As a means of investigating reliability of mathematical models, the PI will analyze the possible occurrence of finite-time blowup of locally self-similar type in the context of hydrodynamic models. The PI will consider the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equation as a paradigm and analyze both dissipative and non-dissipative cases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Every day, people work with highly autonomous systems in operational environments, such as teaming with robots in warehouse distribution facilities or flying an airplane. If a person's trust in the autonomy is too high or low relative to its capability, the person may rely on it too much or not use it at all.  Trust changes over time as someone interacts with the autonomous system and learns its capabilities. However, the person's lack of awareness of their own trust influences behavior, and as a result impacts performance and safety. It is difficult to measure someone's trust while they are doing these tasks because accurate measurements of trust often disrupt the work being done. If trust can be measured continuously over time, the person's interaction with the autonomous system can be made safer and more efficient. Given the increased use of autonomy across sectors including manufacturing, aerospace, the tech industry, and military, continuous measures of trust may impact US economy and security. Further, there is a need to prepare a technically trained workforce for advanced operational environments. People who will be working with autonomous systems are often not trained on the importance of trust and how it may change over time. Further, this knowledge can enhance opportunities to enter this in-demand workforce. <br/><br/>To address these needs, the project contributes to fundamental understanding of trust in operational environments by modeling trust dynamics from physiological signals. Changes in trust manifest as physiological responses, which can be detected by monitoring the heart, eye, skin, and brain. While there is increasing interest in physiological monitoring to estimate trust, this work has been constrained to the laboratory under ideal conditions and has yet to be successful applied to operational environments. This project has four Research Goals (R#). R1 models initial trust with physiological features used to predict operators' self-reported trust. R2 assesses learned trust dynamics after repeated interactions with autonomy. R3 investigates trust calibration by assessing operators' trust dynamics when the reliability of the autonomous agent shifts. R4 seeks to understand the utility of wearable sensors to model trust in operational environments. Two demonstration environments are used: a person working with a simulated robot to fill orders in a distribution warehouse, and a person flying an aircraft with the assistance of an automated flight planner. The education component of this project has two educational goals (E#) to train the human-autonomous teaming (HAT) workforce on the importance of trust and engage the next generation of HAT researchers and operators. E1 trains operators on the importance of trust for workplace safety and performance through educational modules for HAT operators. It also informs the research goals through a series of operator interviews to define the task used in this research. E2 increases access and engagement in STEM in Colorado. The key effort in E2 administers experiential learning modules called Traveling Trunks, which are easy-to-administer lessons that use HAT as a hook to increase student interest. They are disseminated in rural, underserved high school classrooms. E2 also incorporates outreach and research mentorship to further reinforce the STEM pipeline. Together, these goals broadly promote an improved understanding of trust in autonomy to demystify its abilities and improve intelligent adoption of autonomy in operational settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experts in ambient energy systems and materials, design, construction, marketing, finance, policy and social science will be assembled to provide their perspectives. The result of the workshop is to be a white paper outlining needs in research, education, and dissemination to increase the use of ambient energy and, thereby, help address the looming climate crisis. The workshop is to be held at DOE in Washington DC, tentatively during July 2023. <br/><br/>Buildings account for nearly half of US carbon emissions. Further, emissions are projected to increase due to the doubling of built floor area by 2060. All-electric net-zero buildings will not solve the problem, because utilities are expected to still burn fossil fuel for nearly half of all electricity by 2050. Locally harvested ambient energy offers a transformational alternative. Nearly ten times more solar energy is incident on buildings than they consume. A number of historic and modern buildings have been heated and cooled entirely from ambient sources. Solar energy can also heat water, dry clothes, cook food, and provide lighting. 100% solar heating has been proven by numerous buildings over many decades. For current technologies, more wide-spread adoption may require innovations in education, training, marketing, and incentives. Thermal, economic and environmental performance could be advanced by new technologies, including heat pipe systems, polymeric solar collectors, phase change materials, transparent insulation, vacuum-insulated panels, and electrochromic surfaces. Adoption could be enhanced with improved design tools and incorporation into building performance standards and codes. It is estimated that with local ambient energy systems serving demands for which they are well-suited, the remaining need for utility-level electricity could be smaller in 2050 than it is today. The workshop will discuss opportunities and strategies for promoting ambient energy use in buildings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, materials cooled to near-absolute zero temperature are not truly frozen but contain constantly fluctuating atomic motions. Although these fluctuations are usually negligible in daily life, theoretically they can grow large when a standing wave is compressed into a very small volume, called a cavity, with dimensions compared with the wave?s wavelength. Under such circumstances, according to some recent theoretical and experimental research, the fluctuating wave may be strong enough to change the properties of materials immersed in the wave, including the atomic structure, electrical conductivity, and magnetic properties. This research attempts to answer a few major open questions in this new paradigm of cavity modified materials based on a specific system: the mixing of electromagnetic waves and atomic vibrations that naturally happens in many ionic crystals. Near the vibrational resonance, which is in the terahertz frequencies, the wavelength of the mixed wave shrinks, so the quantum fluctuation is expected to enhance. The research team plans to directly measure the quantum fluctuation of the light and matter inside small cavities and track the modified energy evolution and materials properties. The results promise insights into optimizing materials by harvesting quantum forces for free. The project also supports the dissemination of the basic concepts of quantum materials to audiences at different levels of education. The principal investigator plans to formulate a modular graduate course to bridge the knowledge gap between existing materials education and the societal need for building quantum infrastructure, to offer an undergraduate research opportunity targeting students in community colleges, and to work with high school teachers in the Houston Independent School District to design a lesson about materials in quantum technology. These efforts are part of NSF?s Big Idea of Quantum Leap and the National Quantum Initiative to build a quantum workforce for the future.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>Emerging experimental evidence and theoretical models open a possibility for cavity-enhanced quantum fluctuations of bosonic modes, including photons and phonons, to significantly alter materials? structural, transport, and magnetic behaviors in both the excited states and the ground state. The quantum fluctuations thus may serve as a control knob to transform quantum materials without the need for active input. However, experimental validation is scarce about a possibility of the amplified fluctuations in terahertz frequencies or the transfer of properties between cavity-coupled bright polaritons and much more numerous cavity-decoupled localized states. This research provides the much-needed experimental knowledge on the magnitude and consequence of the quantum fluctuations of ultra-strongly coupled phonon-polaritons in sub-wavelength cavities, which may guide future efforts to realize various functional quantum materials through cavity engineering, possibly including superconductors, ferromagnets, ferroelectrics, and topological electronic materials. The principal investigator and research team plans to develop sensitive electro-optic microscopy in the terahertz frequencies to quantify the fluctuating electric fields and atomic displacements. The measurements can provide a firmer ground to the theoretical analysis of cavity quantum electrodynamics in realistic, lossy quantum materials. The quantum microscopy combined with time-resolved spectroscopy reveal the coherence and population dynamics of phonon-polariton excitations, which shed light on possible cavity-induced structural transitions. Finally, the acquired knowledge facilitates the design and realization of hybrid terahertz cavity-materials systems to modify the spin and charge states in two-dimensional layered materials and heterostructures, where the electronic interactions are strong and externally tunable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists aim to learn about quantum systems by building a simulator that consists of many quantum particles with controlled interactions, but at a length and time scale amenable to observation and manipulation in the lab. The PI and his team will build a quantum simulator from an array of laser-trapped and cooled ultracold molecules. In contrast to atom-based simulators, the molecules introduce new types of interactions, for example, the long-range and anisotropic interaction from molecular dipole moments. The development of this novel simulation platform will potentially lead to the design of advanced, strongly interacting materials in energy transport, light harvesting, and quantum information science. It will provide invaluable insights into the fundamental properties of a wide range of correlated quantum systems, including black holes and nuclei. The PI will train an interdisciplinary team of students. The PI will also design a curriculum for chemists that integrates quantum sciences, thus helping train the next generation's quantum workforce.<br/> <br/>Technical audience abstract:<br/>The platform is based on a tweezer array of ultracold LiCs molecules, where the interactions between rotational states are mediated by the electric dipole moment and tuned using static and microwave fields. The long-range interaction and long rotational coherence times will be used to simulate an extended Hubbard model and generalized quantum spin model, leading to the observation of new topological, exotic superfluid, and supersolid phases. Several challenges remain before laser-assembled ultracold molecules become a robust simulation platform. First, the Stark shift from the trapping light leads to measured rotational coherence times orders of magnitude shorter than the theoretical limit, which should be minimized when the molecule is in the tweezer ground state.  Second, laser-assembled molecules are currently detected through reverse-assembly back into atoms, and the PI will develop a non-destructive direct molecule imaging scheme based on either a forbidden cycling transition in LiCs or on Rydberg-molecule interactions. Finally, single molecule assembly efficiency is limited by two atom motional excitations in the tweezer, and the PI will develop new more robust tweezer ground state preparation methods beyond Raman sideband cooling.  Together, these breakthroughs will result in record-level interaction fidelity, and the simulation of new classes of strongly interacting systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two or more CMEs can collide during their journey away from the Sun, giving rise to even more complex structures that can potentially enhance space weather effects at Earth.

(2) Is it possible to determine an overall, global structure for CME?CME interaction events, or is every in-situ observation only sampling local properties? (3) Is there a combination of properties of the ?original? CMEs relative to one another that leads to maximum geoeffectiveness? The Science Questions will be addressed via analyses of a series of MHD simulations based on idealized configurations, which will model different CME?CME interaction scenarios and properties of the resulting structures.

However, the conventional thermochemical methods for CO2 capture are energy-intensive, cost-prohibitive, and fossil fuel-dependent. On the other hand, emerging carbon capture approaches driven by electrochemical reactions promise mild operating conditions, flexibility for coupling to intermittent renewable energy resources, and could accommodate the multi-scale nature of carbon capture needs due to their modularity. Nevertheless, the practical deployment of existing electrochemical carbon capture processes remains hindered by issues such as oxygen sensitivity and evaporative loss. Correspondingly, this project explores a new concept for carbon capture modulated by electrochemical stimuli. The concept involves the generation of low-volatility, air-stable CO2 sorbents at an electrode surface, followed by CO2 capture in an absorber unit and the subsequent CO2 release upon switching the polarity of the electrode. The goal is to understand and ultimately harness control over the thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, and transport properties of the model electrochemical system, utilizing a multi-modal toolkit of materials synthesis, characterization, and electroanalysis. The broader impacts involve education and mentoring activities from high school through graduate levels to prepare a young generation of engineers with an interdisciplinary skillset essential to solving humanity?s sustainability challenges, which include developing high school laboratory modules on carbon capture and integrating advances in separation methods and interfacial sciences into the university?s chemical engineering curriculum. <br/><br/>The project aims to research an electrochemical interface composed of redox-tunable Brnsted base moieties that can undergo proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) in non-aqueous electrolytes for the reversible (re)generation of air-stable CO2 sorbents.

At the material level, microporous electrodes will be synthesized to examine the interplay between electrode microstructure and the corresponding mass and charge transport behaviors. The impact of the electrolyte environment on the PCET and CO2 chemisorption kinetics will also be systematically investigated via (electro)analytical techniques.

Simple graphs can model only pairwise relationships among data, which prevents their application to modeling networks with higher-order relationships. Hypergraph signal-processing techniques, on the other hand, are more powerful since they can account for the underlying polyadic relationships among data nodes. Hypergraph signal-processing tools can be used in different areas, including data science, communication networks, epidemiology, and sociology, and in numerous applications - from robotics and self-driving navigation to remote sensing and cyber-physical systems. Point-cloud 3D imaging in remote sensing, for instance, is an emerging and critical technology wherein the tools under development in this project can be applied. In concert with the scientific goals of the project, the team of researchers will develop educational modules on graph and hypergraph signal processing to introduce this emerging field to a broad set of students at their home institutions.<br/> <br/>The research effort radically departs from prior work that relied on symmetric canonical polyadic tensor decompositions. Instead, the theoretical underpinnings are based on the more recently introduced t-product operation in tensor algebra, which allows tensor factorizations that are analogous to matrix factorizations and eigendecompositions. The advantages of adopting t-eigendecompositions are compelling - they preserve the intrinsic structure of tensors and the high-dimensional nature of their signals; most importantly, the orthogonal eigenbasis derived from this formulation allows for a loss-free Fourier decomposition and computationally efficient calculations. The new framework will thus allow for the generalization of traditional graph signal-processing techniques while keeping the dimensionality characteristic of the complex systems represented by hypergraphs. To this end, core elements of the new hypergraph signal-processing framework will be introduced, including shifting operators, convolutions, and the definition of various hypergraph signals. The hypergraph Fourier space will also be defined, followed by the concepts of bandlimited signals, sampling, and learning. The benefits of the new framework will be demonstrated in applications such as spectral clustering, denoising, and classification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will create the next generation of Internet measurement technologies that will improve measurement correctness and completeness by better understanding the structure and connections of networks, temporary behaviors, and the results of measurements. <br/><br/>Developing next-generation Internet measurement requires understanding the complex real-world behavior of network operators around the globe. The project has three thrusts. First, the project will explore and develop methods to understand how routing impacts on-path measurements, globally, with an emphasis on Internet censorship. Second, the project will explore and develop methods understanding how routing impacts end-to-end in-path measurements, focusing on latency, non-determinism, and completeness, with an emphasis on whole-Internet scanning technologies. Third, the project will develop numerous open-source tools and datasets to facilitate the next-generation of path-aware active Internet measurement. <br/><br/>Internet measurement is used for a range of tasks from influencing government policy, to identifying criminals and state-sponsored attacks, to understanding weather-induced network failures. The correctness of active Internet measurements facilitated by the methodologies, datasets, and tools from this project will enable researchers, industry practitioners, policy makers, and governments to more effectively and correctly achieve these diverse goals. Furthermore, this project will establish a community college-focused pathways program aimed at the dual goals of preparing community college transfer students for a successful experience at a research university, while also providing them network and security research opportunities.

Most people think of markets as involving money, for example the stock market. Yet even in problems without money, market design principles play a key role in shaping efficient outcomes. Example problems include medical residency matching, matching students to schools, matching donors to kidneys, fair course seat assignment, housing allocation, and sharing compute resources. Market equilibrium is a key concept in economic theory, specifying how goods, such as course seats or compute resources, can efficiently be distributed among individuals, by finding prices that clear the market. This applies even in settings without money, by giving each individual a budget of faux currency in order to induce a market. Yet, for these ideas to have practical applications, we need methods for computing market equilibria, potentially at large scales. This project will develop an AI and optimization-driven approach to large-scale market equilibrium computation. This will lead to new and fairer algorithms for problems such as matching blood donors to donation sites, course seat allocation, public housing allocation, and fair recommender systems. This project also includes a substantial educational component, including writing a book on modern AI and optimization-based methods for game theory and market design. <br/><br/>The project develops a general AI-driven approach towards operationalizing large-scale market equilibria. This requires the development of new online learning methods that account for real-world structure and machine-learning-based predictions. Concretely, the project makes contributions along the following four technical challenges:  1) Online fair allocation and dynamic markets: The project proposes new algorithms for online fair allocation, based on online learning and first-order methods, with a focus on algorithms that are robust to many types of input models, and the extension of recent advances in optimistic and predictive online learning to the fair allocation setting.  2) Two-sided preferences: A frequent real-world complication not captured by market-equilibrium-based fair allocation is that both sides of the market correspond to agents that we wish to treat fairly. The project develops a new class of two-sided Fisher market models and algorithms.  3) Combinatorial preferences: Combinatorial preferences abound in practice, yet these are not captured by standard models. The project develops new utility classes and associated optimization models and algorithms for handling a wide array of combinatorial utility structures.  4) Statistical inference in Fisher markets: The project will initiate the study of statistical inference in Fisher markets, including questions such as the normality of Fisher markets sampled from an underlying model, as well as a new theory of counterfactual inference in markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many cases, one of these domains consists of polymers, which are long chains of molecules that plastics, rubber, and many biological materials are made of. In parallel, the second domain often consists of tiny inorganic nanoparticles ? rigid regions that can dramatically enhance the polymers? properties. Over the past decade, scientists have found evidence that something strange happens at the interfaces between these domains: the polymer molecules become tightly ?glued? to the particles at the molecular level. This process, known as ?irreversible adsorption?, seems to dramatically alter these materials? properties, with the potential to imbue tolerance of higher temperatures, to alter permeability, and perhaps to enhance mechanical strength.

A central challenge has been the difficulty of probing the evolution of near-substrate and near-particle properties in a temporally and spatially resolved manner during adsorbed layer formation. To overcome these challenges, this work will employ fluorescence experiments to locally probe the evolution of multiple properties near substrates and particles during adsorption. These experiments will be combined with molecular dynamics simulations that will provide spatially resolved insight into how segmental packing, chain conformations, and polymer dynamics co-evolve during adsorbed layer formation. Synergistic experiments and simulations will take an integrated approach to systematically probe the layer formation process, the behavior of isolated adsorbed layers, and the ultimate impact of the adsorbed layer presence on material properties, all across a matrix of key controlling variables. This strategy will establish an understanding of how multiple mechanisms may interact to drive adsorbed layer formation and mediate its impact on polymer properties.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These experiments are used to understand the link between the interior and atmospheres of rocky planets. This work also provides hands-on research experience for students at both the undergraduate and graduate level. There is still much that is not understand about atmospheres, the layer of gases surrounding planets. Rocky planets, like the Earth, may form atmospheres during the early stages of their formation. Planet atmospheres form when gas is released from the planet due to heating within its interior. Meteorites are left over rocky material from the early stages of planet formation. They provide a unique way to link the initial makeup of atmospheres to the ingredients that went into building planets. This connection is important because planets are not easily observed by telescopes; the main window into other worlds is through their atmospheres. <br/><br/>The investigator will determine the composition of meteorite outgassing species, especially those relevant for exoplanet observations such as H2O, CO, CO2, and CH4. The objectives are to 1) use a thermogravimetric analyzer combined with a small gas chromatograph system to measure the outgassing of gas species for various meteorite types at temperatures up to 1600C and under various redox conditions and 2) use complementary geochemical techniques to track changes in the bulk composition and mineralogy of outgassing residues. These experiments are relevant for rocky planets, including those around Sun-like stars, those that formed in more oxidizing conditions, hot rocky planets, and those that experience open-system conditions. This research can provide foundational data for observing, modeling, and interpreting atmospheric signatures of exoplanets.

Community supervision agencies had to drastically adapt policies to manage social distancing during supervision contacts and provide assistance to individuals to achieve supervision goals. One of the greatest challenges during the pandemic was the lack of clear and consistent guidelines for supervision agencies to use. This project combines research-based findings about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on community supervision agencies, experiences of clients, and supervision officers during the pandemic. These findings along with feedback from a panel of experts from a variety of fields will be used to achieve two primary goals: 1) development of a comprehensive evidence-based understanding of the response to and impact of COVID-19 on the field of community supervision; and 2) application of the collected evidence to develop empirically-supported pandemic response guidelines for supervision agencies. The value of this effort is to systematically learn from the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future pandemics. Collectively, these efforts will improve both knowledge and practice by contributing to developing a knowledgebase of empirical evidence and a toolkit for practitioners and agencies to use in the future. <br/><br/>This study is informed by three main research questions: 1) What responses during COVID-19 were successful and unsuccessful in community supervision agencies? 2) What are the short and long-term impacts of how supervision agencies responded during COVID-19?; and 3) What are the better strategies to implement in response to future pandemics or emergency situations? We will use a multi-staged approach involving research evaluation of responses and impact of responses in three jurisdictions and collaboration with experts across relevant fields to inform two key deliverables. These deliverables include a database of successful practices and policies for the field and Practice Guidelines for the Community Corrections Responses to Viral Pandemics. This project has the potential to expand what has already been done on the COVID-19 pandemic in the field of supervision through a comprehensive consensus building process using the RAND/UCLA model. This will identify adaptations to community supervision practice and the impact of those adaptations for agencies, supervision officers, and individuals under supervision. This project includes multiple perspectives and examines the impact of pandemic responses on key outcomes to advance knowledge, inform evidence-based tools for the community supervision field, and identify areas for possible reform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is difficult to forecast eruptions, in part because we do not fully understand the origin of volcano seismicity. Three eruptions of Mount Spurr (in Alaska) were preceded by interesting seismic signals. Investigators on this project will investigate the origin of these seismic signals by studying the migration pathways of magma in the days before the eruptions. The proposed work will track magma migration through the crust using gradients of water in crystals from the erupted volcanic ash. Results of this work will be shared with local high school students at an annual Volcano Summer School. At this summer school, students and future K-12 science teachers will learn about volcanoes and volcanic hazards. Classroom exercises created for this summer school will be shared with current and future K-12 science teachers.<br/><br/>Water in feldspar has potential as a barometer and chronometer for tracking the migration and stalling of water-rich magmas in the hours to weeks prior to eruption. However, limited data is available for assessing the partitioning and diffusion behavior of water in feldspar. The proposed work would contribute new experiments that would explore water partitioning and diffusion in plagioclase feldspar as a function of water concentration, major and trace element composition, and oxygen fugacity. Water concentration gradients across plagioclase from three geophysically monitored eruptions of Mt. Spurr would then be used to assess the ascent paths of magmas in the hours to days before their eruption. These petrologic constraints on magma migration will be compared to the geophysical record of volcanic unrest, enabling us to test competing hypotheses regarding the staging of magma in the days before these significant eruptions. The proposed work provides a complete educational pathway from high school to graduate school: high school students from local schools and future STEM teachers will participate in an annual Volcano Summer School at University of Maryland (UMD); undergraduate researchers will lead the acquisition and interpretation of geochemical data from samples of the 1992 eruptions of Crater Peak; and a graduate student will lead the experimental research. Results of the proposed work will be integrated into UMD classes and the Volcano Summer School in the form of data-driven exercises.

Improving how mathematics-focused education research is communicated to a teacher audience?using strategies that are useful and valuable from the teacher perspective?is one key avenue for mitigating consequences of the research-practice gap. This project will develop, assess, and refine innovative key abstracts (i.e., concise, infographic-type resources) for communicating mathematics-focused practitioner articles with a teacher audience. Teacher perspectives will be embedded throughout the project to inform key abstract design. The project also involves a collaboration with the university disability center to provide funded research opportunities in STEM education to university students with disabilities.<br/><br/>This project builds on a sequence from a systematic journal analysis that will develop a database of practitioner articles for subsequent project studies; to a qualitative exploration of teachers? perceptions of key abstracts; to a mixed methods study; and finally, to an experimental pretest-posttest control group design to investigate the impact of abstract types on teachers? perceptions and behavioral intentions. The context for the research is communication of mathematics-focused practitioner articles for supporting upper elementary students with or at risk for mathematics difficulty.

Despite these costs, it is still unclear what ecological and evolutionary processes drive invasions, especially for host species and their parasites. This research will look at the importance of local adaptation and dispersal ability in driving genetic differences among populations of invasive hosts and parasites.  When an invasive species establishes in a new location, it rapidly begins to adapt to its local surroundings. As this adaptation proceeds, genetic differences between invasive populations can emerge and change the way in which hosts and parasites affect one another. The research will also consider the role of dispersal ability, specifically the ability of hosts to move between suitable habitats and of parasites to move between hosts. It will investigate how dispersal ability together with variation among habitats affect patterns of local adaptation for invasive hosts and parasites. The project will significantly advance our understanding of the ways in which hosts and parasites successfully invade new habitats, thereby helping to improve management efforts. In addition, the project will train undergraduate and graduate students in ecological and evolutionary research methods, teaching methods, science communication, and mentorship. A service-learning partnership between university and middle school students will improve representation and sense of belonging for students pursuing biology through engagement in inquiry-based scientific research. Program goals and successes will be broadly shared among a network of educators interested in participating in similar frameworks.<br/><br/>Complex host-parasite systems, those in which a parasite uses multiple species of hosts, present a unique challenge and opportunity to better understand invasion dynamics. The system to be explored here is the invasive faucet snail and its trematode parasites. The faucet snail (Bithynia tentaculata) was introduced from Europe to North America in the early 1900s. Several species of trematodes are hosted by faucet snails and complete their life cycle in waterfowl, causing high rates of mortality in species such as Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis). Research goals include: 1) using genomic sequencing to reconstruct invasion histories of snail hosts and trematode parasites and comparing evolutionary models of invasion scenarios, 2) determining patterns of local adaptation among snail and trematode populations across an active invasion landscape using an experimental, large-scale cross infection design, and 3) determining the relative contributions of dispersal and habitat heterogeneity to patterns of population structure and local adaptation using a combination of field and lab-based approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reinforcement learning (RL), a framework for control-theoretic problems that makes decisions over time within uncertain environments, has many applications in a variety of scenarios, such as recommendation systems, autonomous driving, and finance and business management, to name a few. In modern industry-scale applications of RL models, action decisions, reward- and state-signal collection, and policy iterations are normally implemented in distributed networks. When data packets containing reward signals and action decisions are transmitted through the network, an attacker can intercept and modify these packets to implement adversarial attacks. As RL models are being increasingly deployed in safety-critical and security-related applications, there is a pressing need to understand the effects of potential adversarial attacks on these applications.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigator aims to address the following questions: 1) Should decisions made by RL agents be trusted?; 2) Can an adversary mislead RL agents?; and 3) How to design RL algorithms that are robust to adversarial attacks? While many existing works address adversarial attacks on supervised learning models, the understandings of vulnerabilities of RL models and their corresponding mitigation strategies are less complete, partially due to the significant differences between online RL and supervised learning. In particular, compared with the supervised-learning setting, the design and analysis of attack/defense mechanisms for RL models have to handle challenges such as long-term rewards, no access to future data, and unknown dynamics. The goal of this project is to overcome these challenges and make initial attempts to answer the questions raised above. In particular, this project aims to: 1) systematically investigate potential vulnerabilities of RL models and algorithms, 2) develop robust RL algorithms that can mitigate the impacts of adversarial attacks, and 3) analyze the benefit/cost of these mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simple graphs can model only pairwise relationships among data, which prevents their application to modeling networks with higher-order relationships. Hypergraph signal-processing techniques, on the other hand, are more powerful since they can account for the underlying polyadic relationships among data nodes. Hypergraph signal-processing tools can be used in different areas, including data science, communication networks, epidemiology, and sociology, and in numerous applications - from robotics and self-driving navigation to remote sensing and cyber-physical systems. Point-cloud 3D imaging in remote sensing, for instance, is an emerging and critical technology wherein the tools under development in this project can be applied. In concert with the scientific goals of the project, the team of researchers will develop educational modules on graph and hypergraph signal processing to introduce this emerging field to a broad set of students at their home institutions.<br/> <br/>The research effort radically departs from prior work that relied on symmetric canonical polyadic tensor decompositions. Instead, the theoretical underpinnings are based on the more recently introduced t-product operation in tensor algebra, which allows tensor factorizations that are analogous to matrix factorizations and eigendecompositions. The advantages of adopting t-eigendecompositions are compelling - they preserve the intrinsic structure of tensors and the high-dimensional nature of their signals; most importantly, the orthogonal eigenbasis derived from this formulation allows for a loss-free Fourier decomposition and computationally efficient calculations. The new framework will thus allow for the generalization of traditional graph signal-processing techniques while keeping the dimensionality characteristic of the complex systems represented by hypergraphs. To this end, core elements of the new hypergraph signal-processing framework will be introduced, including shifting operators, convolutions, and the definition of various hypergraph signals.

Catalysis is used extensively in industry to manufacture chemicals, and transition metals are in many instances the key components of the catalysts used.  To tune the properties of metal catalysts to optimize catalytic performance, alloys of two or more metals are sometimes used.  In recent years, much interest has developed in using a particular version of metal alloys, SAAs, as catalysts where a small amount of one metal, e.g. platinum (Pt) in the Zaera lab, is dispersed on nanoparticles (NPs) of a second (Cu) to add specific new functionality.  In the case of hydrocarbon hydrogenations, a family of important catalytic processes where hydrogen atoms (H) are added to carbon-carbon or carbon-oxygen multiple bonds, research using model systems has suggested that the Pt atoms are needed to dissociate H2 to provide the required H atoms.  However, preliminary studies under realistic catalytic conditions have indicated that the behavior of the single atoms may be more nuanced.  This project focuses on characterizing the nature of the surfaces of SAA catalysts under catalytic conditions to better understand the behavior of the minority (Pt) and majority (Cu) metals and their contributions to hydrogenation catalysis to improve catalytic performance.  The knowledge derived from this work is aimed to help tune the selectivity of processes for the industrial production of fine chemicals. The knowledge derivied from this work will also be useful for educational purposes, by providing data to illustrate basic principles in kinetics, catalysis, and NP synthesis in undergraduate and graduate classes. Collaborations with Latin American research groups are being forged, and student participation from groups underrepresented in research is being pursued.<br/><br/>In these studies, Professor Francisco Zaera of the University of California, Riverside is studying the surface composition and chemical behavior of supported SAA nanoparticles (NPs) under catalytic conditions.  The main objective of this project is to characterize SAA catalysts in situ or under operando conditions (while carrying out catalytic processes) to bridge the pressure and materials gaps and better understand their working surface chemistry.  Two hypotheses underpin this proposal: (1) that the minority metal (Pt) may diffuse into the bulk under reaction conditions and influence catalysis in a remote way (a direct consequence of the pressure gap); and (2) that such environment-induced metal diffusion may occur under different conditions in supported NPs vs. in bulk materials (a direct manifestation of the materials gap).  Three parallel experimental approaches are being followed to test the key hypotheses.  First, kinetic measurements under catalytic conditions are being performed on model systems by using a so-called ""high-pressure cell"" and complemented and correlated with results from in situ characterization of the surface using reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS).  Second, synthetic methods are being developed to make well mixed diluted alloys and core-shell bimetallic NPs to investigate the possible diffusion and intermixing of the metals under reaction conditions. Third, catalysts are being characterized under catalytic conditions in situ and under operando conditions by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to evaluate changes in the coordination sphere around the minority atoms, one way to determine their presence on the surface vs. inside the bulk, and by infrared absorption spectroscopy (IR), to extract information about the adsorption mode of the reactants and to titrate the minority atoms available at the surface under catalytic conditions.  The proposal combines studies with model systems, new catalyst synthesis methodology, in situ spectroscopic studies of catalysts, and quantum mechanics calculations to answer a critical question; namely, the effect of the pressure and materials gaps on SAA performance, with wide-ranging implications to the field of catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such breaches negatively impact users and lead to financial and reputational costs for developers. Their adverse effects underscore the need for holistic privacy engineering solutions throughout the software development lifecycle. Recent privacy research has made progress in this regard, yet significant gaps remain, including insufficient implementation guidelines and ex-ante detection of privacy violations. This project addresses these gaps by investigating how novice and expert developers currently implement privacy rules, supporting the developers in detecting privacy behaviors, designing privacy-preserving solutions, and automating the implementation of privacy rules in code. This project will result in models and tools to enhance privacy for all types of software applications. Hence, the project will benefit society by (i) helping to protect the privacy of vulnerable groups, including Maine youth, migrants, and asylum seekers, (ii) supporting the software industry and the U.S. economy, and (iii) broadening access to STEM and computer science education and careers for girls, women, minorities, first-generation students, and other underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project fundamentally advances knowledge in privacy and software engineering by investigating new theories, methods, and tools to describe software privacy behaviors prior to development and then ensure their effective implementation in code. Through three thrusts, the project will: (i) generate new scientific knowledge about the privacy awareness and expertise of developers and the challenges they face; (ii) reduce the effort of manually implementing privacy requirements in code via the development of novel privacy-related code generation models; (iii) minimize privacy violations through examining the current practices for writing privacy-related code and creating novel solutions to improve such practices; and (iv) strengthen communications between legal and technical experts by developing a shared infrastructure for defining and reasoning about privacy solutions from both technical and policy perspectives.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) program, the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC), and the the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It proposes novel approaches for combining laboratory experiments and multiscale mathematical modeling to characterize branching morphogenesis in the mammary gland. Branching morphogenesis is a process by which the female mammary gland develops its tree-like structure during puberty. It governs the formation of other tree-like organs such as the lungs, salivary gland, and kidney. Defects in branching morphogenesis can lead to hypertension, chronic kidney failure, and poor lung function. Mechanisms that control branching morphogenesis are circumvented or altered during the development and progression of breast cancer. Understanding the mechanisms that generate branched organs may identify novel ways to treat breast cancer, regenerate organ function, or design artificial organs to combat diseases. At puberty, branching morphogenesis generates an extensive network of mammary gland epithelium ducts. The epithelium ductal network is connected at its base to the nipple and plays a key role in milk synthesis and secretion for neonates. Molecular and mechanical factors in the tissue environment are important for normal branching morphogenesis. Majority of the research in this area has focused on identifying key molecular factors and the mechanisms by which they regulate branching morphogenesis. How mechanical signaling regulates branching morphogenesis remains largely unknown. The mathematical models proposed in this research will contribute to bridging this gap. This project will build novel multiscale mathematical models to predict how the interactions between mechanical and cellular signaling regulate the formation of the mammary ductal network. <br/><br/>Branching morphogenesis occurs through two stages: the first stage is via successive rounds of elongation and splitting of the tip of individual ducts (i.e., tip bifurcation) and the second stage is via budding along the sides of existing ducts (i.e., side branching).  Increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness is known to increase the sites for epithelium ductal branch initiation. However, how the mechanical signaling originating from the ECM affects branch elongation, tip bifurcation and side branching is not fully understood. This project will (1) combine optimal transport theory, agent-based models, and data from laboratory experiments to predict how interactions between ECM and epithelium cells regulate ductal branch elongation and tip bifurcation in the mammary gland, (2) apply topological data analysis and multifractal analysis to predict the role of tensional force and ECM stiffness on ductal tip bifurcation and side branching in the mammary gland. Findings from this research will improve our understanding of how biomechanical forces affect ductal network formation. This CAREER project will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students at San Diego State University (SDSU). It will integrate mathematical biology research activities in the undergraduate curriculum at SDSU and train students early in their career to approach scientific inquiry in a way that crosses scientific disciplines. Furthermore, this project will provide a summer workshop to guide local teachers-leaders in creating teaching modules that integrate quantitative research and foster critical thinking in high school students in high-need urban schools.<br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the MPS-DMS-Mathematical Biology program, BIO-MCB-Cellular Dynamics and Function program, and MPS-PHY-Physics of Living Systems (PoLS) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the context of rendering, typically an image is generated through random sampling using what are known as Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, simulating how the photons emitted from the light sources interact with the objects in the virtual environment and arrive at the camera. Accurate reconstruction of an image, however, requires simulating a large number of photons, making this approach costly in terms of computational power and energy consumption. This project will dramatically reduce the number of photons required to obtain a high-quality image, thereby significantly reducing the cost. This objective is achieved by novel ways of finding high-likelihood photon paths and by enhancing the quality of the image after rendering. Project outcomes will have broad impact on applications such as those mentioned above, as well as in areas beyond graphics that also rely on MC integration. Educational and outreach activities will use compelling real-world problems and concepts in computer graphics, particularly rendering, as motivational tools to get people of diverse ages and demographic backgrounds excited about STEM.<br/><br/>This research will focus on accelerating the convergence of MC rendering by developing novel methods that operate during or after rendering. The two most common categories of methods used in this setting are importance sampling (during) and reconstruction/denoising (after). Unfortunately, the majority of existing importance sampling techniques provide path guidance locally and thereby ignore the model error on future points along the path. Moreover, current state-of-the-art reconstruction/denoising methods use a neural network trained on a set of noisy images and their corresponding ground truth, and the performance of these methods on test images that lie outside the distribution of the training data can be suboptimal. This project addresses these challenges by introducing novel frameworks that view these problems in a fundamentally different way. The specific research objectives are twofold: (1) To guide the paths according to distributions that are estimated in an error-aware manner, which requires introducing a global objective function that takes the entire path into consideration. (2) To design denoising systems that can be adapted to the test example at hand, by posing the denoising problem as an optimization problem and developing novel objectives that work effectively without the need for ground truth images.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complementary to the algorithmic results, the project will also develop information-theoretic and statistical-query lower bounds to broaden the understanding of fundamental limits posed by the practical constraints.

However, data visualization is not neutral; choices about what to visualize and how to visualize it can impact how a viewer interprets the visualization, especially when they don?t have access to the underlying data. This fact raises important questions about how and whether people trust their interactions with visualized data, and how visualization designers can help viewers develop appropriately calibrated trust (not overtrusting unreliable inferences nor undertrusting meaningful relationships) in the visualization. This project?s goal is to advance research around assessing and designing for trust calibration in visualizations: creating appropriate measures of trust in human-data interaction, building models of how visualization design choices can impact trust, and developing design guidelines for both creators and consumers of visualizations to help them identify signs of trust and mistrust in visualized data. The project team will also create visualization tools, educational materials, and empirical data to help researchers, policymakers, and members of the general public think about trustworthy computing and visualization ethics.<br/><br/>The project is structured around three research objectives. First, referencing theories and research methodologies from social sciences, the project team will produce a collection of methods to reliably measure user trust in data visualizations. Second, using these methods, the team will conduct a systematic series of empirical studies that identify which visualization design factors can drive critical thinking and calibrated trust. These factors will include manipulations of the perceived clarity, complexity, accuracy, and amount of data, using real-world datasets across multiple domains related to public policy and finance. The use of such diverse data will allow the team to identify domain-specific versus generalizable visualization elements that promote critical thinking and calibrated trust. The third objective is a formal evaluation of these guidelines through testing prototype visualizations and visualization systems that facilitate calibrated trust. This will involve field studies and interviews with researchers, practitioners, and members of the general public to examine the effectiveness of the trust guidelines and identify ethical practices for trustworthy visual data communication.

From offices to manufacturing to service, AR technology offers far-reaching benefits, but improving how users interact with virtual worlds through AR glasses is essential to this transformation. AR systems must be designed to understand the subtleties and complexities of human communication, which come in a broad combination of modes?gestures, speech, text, gaze, and more. Current AR head-mounted systems cannot process multiple communication modes and they recognize only coarse gestures that are awkward and tiring for users to produce. One approach to reducing fatigue and promoting intuitive interaction is for the system to recognize and process microgestures. In this project, these simple, small finger movements, akin to those needed to control the volume on a car radio, are studied to build foundational knowledge needed to make human-AR interaction systems more intuitive and broadly accessible. Reducing the barriers to interaction with AR technology will allow people to concentrate on their tasks rather than the technology itself. This research impacts fields such as meteorology, finance, healthcare, and scientific visualization, facilitating rich data exploration, and improving data understanding and decision making. Implementing this research in massive open online courses (MOOCs) will benefit students learning independently and in education institutions, allowing access to anyone interested in this topic.<br/><br/>This project advances AR multimodal interaction research by studying intuitive microgesture interaction techniques and additional communication modalities. The proposed research plan for these studies involves inputs combined with speech, a 6 degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pen, a controller, and midair gestures. Bimanual interaction will also be evaluated. The results of these studies will answer an important question, ?What should microgestures and multimodal interaction look like in AR??, leading to a unified framework of multimodal interactions and the creation of a Multimodal Interaction ToolKit (MITK). Immersive analytics (that is, 3D data visualizations) will be used as a domain for performing system validations. Further, the investigator will evaluate and extend the findings from AR to virtual reality (VR). This research advances the state of the art in AR and VR interaction by: (1) researching and developing microgestures for selection, manipulation, and navigation; (2) designing, developing, and evaluating novel unimodal and multimodal interaction techniques, including virtual widgets; and (3) expanding fundamental knowledge of microgestures and their use in joint tasks.

These caves form where groundwaters carrying dissolved hydrogen sulfide are exposed to oxygen, usually at or near the cave water table. Hydrogen sulfide is unstable in the presence of oxygen, and it rapidly reacts to form sulfuric acid and other sulfur compounds that dissolve limestone and precipitate new minerals. And because of the abundant chemical energy from hydrogen sulfide, chemosynthetic microorganisms thrive at the water table and speed up sulfide oxidation, producing what might be the fastest known rates of cave enlargement. This project will use an interdisciplinary combination of microbiology, geochemistry, and modeling to determine where, how, and how fast limestone dissolves in these caves, and how specifically microorganisms contribute to bedrock corrosion. Results from this research will show us how microorganisms form caves, but also how they contribute to similar carbonate weathering processes that occur across other more widespread but less accessible subsurface environments. Carbonate mineral weathering by strong acids is an important source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but sulfuric acid weathering is not well understood in the terrestrial subsurface, especially in areas with limestone and other carbonate bedrock. Sulfuric acid caves are windows through which we can directly access and study these extensive but otherwise hidden processes of subterranean carbonate weathering, gas flux, and mineral formation. And, caves are exceptional platforms for science communication. This project will take advantage of the excitement of caves to create new educational opportunities through course-based research, K-12 teacher education, and science communication activities. <br/><br/>In actively-forming sulfuric acid caves, substantial limestone corrosion and void development can occur above the water table, where springs and streams degas hydrogen sulfide to the cave atmosphere. However, the overall impact of this degassing-driven processes is not well understood, and we don?t know the contribution of vadose corrosion for sulfuric acid cave formation, or how microorganisms affect karst development above the water table. This project will therefore combine geochemical and molecular analyses with speleogenetic modeling to address three questions: (1) Do microorganisms speed up sulfide oxidation and limestone dissolution above the water table, and can these rates explain observed cave morphologies? (2) How do microorganisms affect subaerial carbonate dissolution, both during the active phase of sulfuric acid corrosion but also throughout the long lifetime of the caves? (3) What is the impact of gas emissions from sulfuric acid karst for climate and carbon cycling? The team will address these questions by combining direct measurements of limestone dissolution and biological sulfide oxidation kinetics with metatranscriptomics and other community analyses to directly link microbial activity with cave formation both close to and far from the sulfidic aquifer. They will use air flow and speleogenetic modeling to relate these measurements to cave morphologies and gas flux. And they will explore how these processes change in ancient sulfuric acid caves that no longer have a sulfide source.

For example, television news meteorologists often use visualizations of a hurricane's forecasted path to inform the public about an approaching storm. Unfortunately, a large body of research demonstrates that people misinterpret the most common methods for visualizing uncertainty in forecasts such as these. This project?s goal is to learn more about why people have difficulty using forecast visualizations and how to create more effective ones. One key outcome of the project will be a theory of uncertainty visualization literacy that will identify the skills needed to effectively use visualized uncertainty and provide cognitively informed rules for new visualization designs. This work will develop more effective methods to convey forecast uncertainty, along with uncertainty literacy training that will support the public in making informed decisions in response to natural disasters and public health crises.<br/><br/>The research plan includes a series of empirical studies to test competing hypotheses, including a novel theory centered around integrating users' mental models into visualization design and training. The new hypothesis predicts that uncertainty visualization reasoning errors result from discrepancies between how people conceptualize a forecast (a priori schemas) and how the visualization presents the data (visualization-driven schemas). The first phase of this work will create tools to reveal a priori schemas and visualization-driven schemas using previously established cognitive methods for evaluating schemas. These methods include analysis of participants' drawings, eye tracking, and memory tests. In the second phase, the team will develop a measurement tool to determine the relative distance between the two schemas, using a mapping agreement unit based on methods developed in human factors, then use that tool to empirically test the schema-based theory compared to alternative explanations for reasoning errors when using uncertainty visualizations. In the third phase, the team will use the winning approaches to develop visualization training and new visualization designs of hurricane path forecasts and COVID-19 morbidity projections as testbeds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Home Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart home cameras, smart speakers, motion sensors, smart watches and more are a fast-growing global market that not only represents one of the most important new ways of collecting data about people, but also takes place in a particularly private space, the home. As articulated in recent public debates, it is crucial that people be able to access, assess, and control their own data in order to better understand both themselves and what others can learn about them, as well as to manage possible privacy and surveillance risks of allowing these data to be collected. To help people control their own data, the project team will bring together technologists and artists to create new ways for individuals to experience the data they create through IoT systems that observe them and their homes. This ?small data? approach is designed to center individual agency and control around data, helping people be more aware and engaged participants in the data economy while advancing knowledge around visualization and sense-making of data.<br/><br/>The project is structured as a series of first-person research collaborative artist residencies that develop and then generalize bespoke physical representations (?physicalizations?) of data. Starting with a first-person approach is crucial because developing meaningful physicalizations require a close understanding of both the context and the people involved in the data collection, such as, the circumstances of the home, the particular technologies in play, the residents? current understanding of data, and so on. Thus, each residency will start by developing a series of physicalization prototypes tuned to the resident artist?s context. Then, the project team will iterate on both the prototypes and the methods used in creating them to create public-facing activities and tools that a wider range of people can experiment with and customize to their own homes, technologies, and understandings. Together, the work will (1) develop new tools and methods for physicalizing IoT data in context, (2) increase rigor in first-person methods with regards to documenting, analyzing and disseminating findings, (3) examine the creative possibilities of collaborations between technology design and the arts that will generalize beyond the specific problem of data physicalization, and (4) advance the practice and tools available for other researchers interested in small data-focused research. The collaboration of technology designers and artists also has the potential to invite and involve communities who are often underrepresented in computing, for instance women and students in the arts and humanities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project develops new theoretical frameworks, analyses, and techniques for distributed computing and machine learning aiming to (i) accelerate the computation time by overcoming system bottlenecks, (ii) ensure accurate computation in the presence of hardware errors and faults, and (iii) enable data-processing approaches that adhere to data-privacy constraints. These attributes will be enabled by inducing a controlled amount of redundancy in computations based on coding theory - a field that has enabled modern data communication and storage technologies. To obtain a realistic understanding of what is possible in the long run, the developed techniques will be accompanied by fundamental bounds on the tradeoffs between computation accuracy, data privacy, error tolerance, and redundancy overheads. The project will disseminate outcomes and enable awareness of developed research to the broader scientific community through publications, tutorials, and curricular integration.<br/><br/>Coded computing is a sub-area of information and coding theory that induces redundancy into distributed computing. Coded computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to relieve straggler, communication, and data-privacy bottlenecks in large-scale distributed machine learning. Yet, state-of-the-art coded-computing techniques, mostly devised to enable exact reconstruction of the computation output, have fundamental efficiency limitations, particularly for nonlinear computation tasks. This project develops techniques for approximate coded computing, wherein the decoder aims to obtain the function output within a prescribed distortion limit, and data-privacy constraints are posed as limits on differential-privacy parameters. The research will be conducted in three closely connected thrusts: (i) coding schemes for fault-tolerant approximate matrix multiplication, (ii) coding schemes for fault-tolerant approximate nonlinear computations beyond matrix multiplications, and (iii) coding schemes for differentially private computations. The techniques developed will combine ideas from information and coding theories, mathematical approximation theory, and differential privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to explore a new RPC system architecture that allows for efficient and flexible control of RPC traffic.<br/><br/>The key insight is to rearchitect RPC as a managed service, decoupling RPC logic from individual applications. Applications specify type information to the RPC service, and the RPC service executes RPC policies and arbitrates resource use, and then marshals data customized to the underlying network hardware capabilities. The project entails four thrusts: (1) a safe cross-domain RPC memory management design, (2) a system design for efficient RPC policy support, (3) a system design for RPC live upgradability, and (4) techniques to use remote direct memory access hardware effectively in RPC.<br/><br/>The new RPC architecture will improve the performance and manageability of cloud applications and reduce the cost of operating cloud applications.

While superconducting quantum devices have reached a high level of maturity as a technology, coupling of qubits to one another to enable large-scale circuits for practical computation still remains a challenge. This project seeks to address this challenge by exploring a new approach for coupling superconducting circuits using a thin electromagnetic coupler interposed between qubit layers. The proposed work will be based on an innovative integration of quantum elements that are by themselves well-established in the PI?s and Co-PIs? labs. Successful performance of the proposed work will expand our knowledge of quantum states in superconducting devices and will result in the development of improved quantum manufacturing approaches of broad interest for practical quantum information processing technologies. The team is committed to mentoring graduate and undergraduate students and to broadening the participation of under-represented groups in quantum engineering. In addition, the PIs will be involved in outreach efforts aiming to raise awareness about physics, materials science, and mathematics to school students. A substantial part of this effort will reach out to school students from the local Native American community. <br/><br/>Developing new approaches to 3D integration of superconducting qubits is of crucial relevance for realizing high-depth circuits suitable for running practically relevant algorithms. Current coupling techniques for transmon qubits typically involve relatively large (millimeter-sized) coplanar resonators, while for phase qubits a variety of different capacitive or inductive coupling approaches are being investigated. No optimal solution has yet been identified for vertical expansion. Existing approaches are typically planar, due in part to limitations stemming from the technology used to create the qubit Josephson junctions (JJs) typically angle-deposition and controlled oxidation of the tunnel barrier. This results in low spatial densities for JJ circuits and coherence-limiting cross-talk. In order to address this challenge, the PIs will fabricate high-quality JJ array chips and link them vertically via waveguide arrays operating in the microwave frequencies. While each enabling component and manufacturing method has been demonstrated, their integration is a daunting task with high-risk and the co-PIs are uniquely positioned to tackle this challenge. Intellectual significance: the team?s vision of full-3D integration of JJs and cross-talk shielding is in its early stages and untested experimentally, yet presents a potentially transformative approach to solve, in a single stroke, the triple challenge of efficient superconducting circuit coupling, high-density 3D vertical integration, and cross-talk mitigation.  Additionally, the project will train graduate students in state-of-the art quantum device nanofabrication, advanced materials growth, and quantum transport. The PIs will also develop courses on quantum information sciences aimed at undergraduates and quantum engineering/manufacturing aimed at graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This goal will be pursued by synergistically integrating research and education-associated tasks within three objectives: (1) identifying sustainable design principles for EPVs based on circular end-of-life (EoL) options and advancing sustainability education with EoL-related concepts; (2) analyzing the use and EoL phase-related environmental impacts and cost dimension of EPVs and advancing solar energy education in higher education in South Dakota, and; (3) assessing enviro-economic models for novel application of EPVs, creating decision support tools (EPV-Life tool), and disseminating the research results by offering workshops. Considering that EPVs can create an important market for the solar energy industry, enviro-economic models of EPVs and their novel applications are essential to inform PV stakeholders regarding the pathways for environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable solar energy. As a result, the societal benefits of this project include methods for offsetting greenhouse gases and facilitating an effective education mechanism for EPVs technology.<br/><br/>The investigator will design the EPV architectures following refurbish, remanufacture, and recycle (triple-r) principles while this technology is still partially in the R&D stage. The focal point of design for triple-r is to determine device architecture that allows environmentally friendly and economically feasible EoL management schemes. The investigator will assess the life cycle toxic impacts from the use and EoL phase of EPVs due to a catastrophic event and/or breakage or improper disposal. As a result, the use phase-related environmental impacts of PV projects installed on paved (i.e., rooftops) and unpaved (i.e., ground-mounted) surfaces and long-term impacts related to improper dumping will be better understood, and strategies to prevent these from happening can be formulated. The investigator will design all processes involved in the entire life cycle of EPVs using the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) metric, with explicit focus on assessing the net cost of triple-r options that minimize the net cost of electricity from EPVs. Integration of EoL to the LCOE metric will allow for comprehensive development of EPVs with a closed-loop approach. All processes involved in the entire life cycle of EPVs and their novel application fields will be designed using enviro-economic tradeoffs analyzed in this project. A primary focus will be on assessing bifacial systems used in urban/ sub-urban deployment and EPV coupled battery systems in rural/remote applications. The research and educational goals of this project are integrated by focusing on five broader impacts activities: 1) Training graduate and  undergraduate students, 2) working closely with Youth & Family Services to outreach to K-12 students, including minority students from the underserved, economically disadvantaged, and underrepresented (e.g., Native American) in western South Dakota, 3) working with Rapid City?s Sustainability Committee to outreach local communities to promote sustainable solar energy and inform them about residential solar deployment?s benefits, 4) partnering with the solar industry and research centers to enhance the infrastructure for research and education, and 5) disseminating research results broader communities with peer-reviewed publications, national and international presentations, and EPV- Life tool, and the team?s Twitter account and YouTube videos.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the ENG/CBET Environmental Sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the long-term dynamics of two-dimensional fluids is thus fundamental to weather prediction, climate science, and astrophysics. This project aims to advance our understanding of two-dimensional fluids from the perspectives of both geometry and dynamical systems, as well as to bridge the gap between these disciplines through the training of junior researchers and the organizing of mini-courses and conferences.<br/><br/>The focus of this work will be the study of the prototype of all such systems, the forced two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and their inviscid, unforced counterpart, the Euler equations. We will analyze the physically relevant regimes of long time and weak dissipation/forcing, in various orders of limits. A rather surprising and mysterious feature of this system is that, in one regime (Euler), it captures the birth and permanence of order in the form of large hurricane ? like whirls ? while in another regime (Navier-Stokes) it describes a disorderly, seemingly random, turbulent soup of eddies. That is, an ideal Euler fluid tends towards order over time through a process of vortex mergers and mixing, whereas a Navier-Stokes fluid with very slight viscosity and forcing tends towards disorder through a cascade of instabilities in accord with longstanding conjectures of Kolmogorov. The project aims to advance our understanding of these fundamental aspects of fluid motion by studying the behavior of solutions both near and far from equilibrium through the lens of partial differential equations, geometry, and dynamical systems.

In safety-critical areas such as medicine, such errors can lead to serious consequences, especially in the many cases where these errors might be preventable. A common cause of medical errors is when health workers lack situational awareness -- knowing what is going on within an environment and predicting what is likely to happen next -- and make mistakes based on this lack of awareness. This project looks to reduce these mistakes through developing novel computing and interaction techniques that support situational awareness for physically and cognitively preoccupied health workers who are part of emergency medical services (EMS) teams that provide urgent medical care in the field. The research team will work closely with EMS providers to understand their cognitive needs and develop hands-free, minimally distracting cognitive aids that support their situational awareness and decision-making in fast-paced crisis response situations. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to determine how to support fast-response medical teams? awareness of context-specific information and activities while accounting for their limited capacity in processing information and ability to interact with handheld computing devices while doing their job.

Semiconductor technology is entering a new age as the transistor scaling that has provided the past 50 years of progress slows down. Electronic-photonic (EP) integration offers a path to revolutionizing these capabilities via powerful new systems-on-chip (SoCs) for applications from optical input/output (I/O) today, through future radio frequency/mm-wave signal processing for 5G/6G wireless, light detection and ranging (lidar) imaging, and new paradigms for computing like artificial intelligence (AI) scale-out fabrics, photonics-interfaced superconducting electronics, and quantum computing. This path of innovation requires a convergent, interdisciplinary co-design approach intertwining the skills of photonics designers, electronic circuit/system designers, process engineers, and system/application experts. Researchers plan to utilize initial proof-of-concept developments to team with the domain and application experts and establish a base research and educational portfolio and a research team to shape the Center-scale Co-Design research effort.<br/><br/>Monolithic electronics-photonics integration has been demonstrated by the members of the team - its use and advantage in classical optical interconnects, as well as the design of the first photon-pair source with integrated electronic sensing and control, molecular and ultrasound eletronic-photonic sensor systems-on-chip, a design of the mm-wave analog photonic link and a demonstration of the first cryo-photonic link.

There are many challenges to performing this task reliably and efficiently. Recent research has shown that making small changes to the data points can lead to misdetection. Therefore, it is critical to make learning models robust against such data perturbations, especially in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. This project aims to achieve this for a specific category of data perturbations called ""sparse attacks."" Sparse-attack scenarios are those in which perturbations occur in only a few coordinates of the data, such as a few pixels in an image. Despite their importance and various real-world applications, sparse attacks have not been widely studied from a theoretical perspective.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to develop a theoretical framework for robust machine learning in the presence of adversarial perturbations that are bounded in L0 norm, or so-called sparse attacks. There have been significant theoretical studies on non-sparse adversarial attacks, but such fundamental understanding has been lacking for the sparse setting. This is partly due to the challenges in the L0 setting, namely, the L0 ball being non-convex and highly non-smooth. The first goal of this project is to study the fundamental limits of robust classification for stylized mathematical models. This will be done by proposing defense methods that are provably robust against L0 attacks, as well as proving converse results. Ideally, one aims to establish tight achievability and converse bounds asymptotically to fully characterize the optimal robust classifier. Motivated by practical considerations, the performance of the proposed defense methods in other scenarios will also be studied. In particular, this project explores the generalization properties of the proposed robust hypothesis class in order to study the effect of finite samples when the data distribution is unknown. Furthermore, the project consists of an evaluation plan to implement the developed defense mechanisms and analyze its performance in terms of learning a model which is robust against sparse attacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These environmental pollutants have been found on the ocean surface and in the deep ocean. This research focuses in particular on semicrystalline polymers, which constitute over 70% of all plastics used currently. When these polymers environmentally degrade in the aqueous milieu (i.e., in oceans) experiments consistently show that the chain segments in the amorphous phase break first, while the crystalline population actually grows. This work proposes that semicrystalline polymers form nanoplastics (100 nm and smaller) due to the preferential fragmentation of amorphous-phase tie chains which originally provided the connectivity between adjacent crystalline lamellae. By analogy to the phenomenon of environmental stress cracking, breaking of these molecular connectors leads to local material failure and the formation of nanoplastics. The proposed work will combine experimental and theoretical tools to elucidate the proposed degradation mechanisms of semicrystalline polymers of varying chemistries when exposed to mechanical stresses, water, O2 and/or UV light. Experimentally, it shall correlate nanoparticle creation with the initial polymer chemistry and morphology. How these variables affect the size, structure and properties of the resulting environmental pollutants are open questions that this research shall critically address. Parallel theoretical studies will predict the temporal evolution of the connectivity between adjacent crystals, the mechanical properties of the degrading plastics, and hence the size and number of nanoplastic objects that are temporally generated from a bulk polymer. The work will thus bring the well-established tools of polymer characterization towards delineating the critical physics underpinning the formation of nanoplastics. Going beyond these aspects, it is proposed that the use of copolymers or extruding the material can increase connectivity between crystals and thus serve as an efficient strategy to mitigate their creation. Design problems inspired by this research will be showcased in interdisciplinary programs such as the Engineering Design curriculum. The project will also facilitate undergraduate research opportunities and the training of a diverse cohort of junior and senior students at Columbia University. The PI will develop online learning modules related to the theme of this proposal for undergraduate and K-12 students. This PI has already run a three-day virtual workshop at Columbia University on the application of Machine Learning to materials science. Achieving the goal of decreasing nanoplastic creation is the ultimate focus of the proposed work, which is thus centrally focused on global sustainability.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Identifying events to describe who did what to whom and their relations (causal, subevent, and coreferential) from a large amount of text can provide valuable data to support intelligent applications and data-driven decisions over various domains. However, current event structure extraction systems can only perform over text data for a few popular languages such as English, Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic. Text data from many other languages in the world thus cannot be processed by current event extraction systems. This limitation has hindered the coverage of data sources for the systems, introduced language biases in the extracted events, and delayed updates with latest events in local reports. Eventually, the collected event data from current techniques cannot comprehensively represent the latest dynamics over the world to effectively support decision making for important problems of national interests. To address the multilingual challenges, this project will develop event extraction and event-event relation extraction systems that can be effective for data in multiple languages, emphasizing on understudied and low-resource languages to improve the coverage of extracted data and promote democratization of technologies. In information retrieval, multilingual event structure data from the developed technologies can enable data management systems to quickly obtain answers and create summaries for broader user queries in many more languages. In cybersecurity, databases for extracted cyber attack events from multilingual sources can be used to generate more fine-grained and comprehensive reports to inform resource allocation decisions to better protect online activities. In socio-political science, coded conflict and meditation events from more languages can increase the scope and reduce biases of the data to support better decisions for foreign policy, civil war prevention, environmental challenges, or economic strategies.<br/><br/>This project will address three fundamental limitations of existing multilingual learning research for event structure extraction: (i) the lack of multilingual datasets that provide data annotation for multiple languages to sufficiently support generalization evaluation of models across different language families, (ii) the limitations of current multilingual representation learning methods when aligning representations between languages to induce language-general features, and (iii) the scarcity of labeled data in different languages to train multilingual models. First, the project will annotate documents for all event extraction and event-event relation extraction tasks in many more languages using consistent schemas. The selected languages for annotation will be typologically diverse, understudied and low-resource to provide reliable multilingual evaluation data for the developed methods. Second, to boost cross-lingual performance for event structure extraction, this project will devise multilingual representation learning methods to enable effective knowledge transfer where models trained on labeled data of high-resource languages can be directly applied to data of other languages. The project will develop novel representation alignment methods for different languages using representation matching, augmentation, and language-general structure induction for text. Third, concerning limited training data for multilingual learning, this project will develop novel methods to automatically generate labeled data in different languages. The project will introduce techniques to mitigate noises in the generated data and optimize generation procedures to boost multilingual learning and performance.

Traditional materials for these composites are inherently non-recyclable. One approach to this problem is to take advantage of recent advances in materials chemistry that enable the production of materials with strong chemical bonds that are able to break and reform in a reversible manner. Polymeric materials with these bonds can be repaired after fracture or completely recycled, a capability that has led to the development of a large range of sustainable materials.  These types of materials have typically been used and assessed in the soft, rubbery state, where the material stiffness is much too low for use as a structural material.  This project is designed to develop the background knowledge needed to produce rigid, recyclable materials for structural applications.  An important hypothesis being tested as a part of the project is that the incorporation of reversible bonds in a rigid material can also result in property enhancements that would not be obtainable otherwise.  Successful completion of the project will be an important step toward the development of strong, lightweight materials that can be repaired while still in service.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The proposed work is based on the synthesis of model epoxy networks with aromatic disulfide bonds incorporated at various points within the network structure. Different crosslinkers will be used to adjust the glass transition temperature of the network, allowing independent control of the relaxation dynamics associated with the glass transition and the dynamics associated with disulfide exchange. Three interrelated activities will be pursued in order to characterize these materials and develop a molecular-level understanding of the deformation mechanisms. The first of these is a series of mechanical measurements characterizing material deformation in the vicinity of a propagating crack in the material. The second involves direct visualization of the spatial distribution of thiyl radicals that form during cleavage of the disulfide bonds, using Raman scattering and an array of colorimetric techniques. Additionally a series of thin film experiments utilizing quartz crystal resonators will be used to assess the high frequency rheological properties of the polymers, along with their degradation kinetics and stability in different environmental conditions.  These resonators will also be used to develop methods for environmental monitoring in a variety of contexts.  Collectively, these experiments will lead to the development of a general strategy for the production of tough, lightweight, recyclable polymeric materials for structural applications. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Programmers need positive expressiveness to describe the good things a program should do, as well as negative expressiveness to prevent the bad things a program should never do.  Both angles of expressiveness are involved when programmers must satisfy several competing requirements, from low-level needs of managing efficient use of resources to high-level needs of ensuring critical safety and security guarantees.  Currently, there are two popular methods for organizing programs to meet these goals --- the object-oriented and functional paradigms --- that use different techniques with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of programming languages are stuck within just one of the two paradigms, making it difficult for programmers to harness simultaneously the expressive benefits of both.  The novelties of this project are (i) to use new connections between computer programming and the mathematical foundations of logic for the purpose of designing practical, multi-paradigm programming languages, (ii) to develop user-friendly idioms for programmers to utilize the new features from formal logic, and (iii) to apply this logical core as a bridge between high-level and low-level concerns of programs.  In contrast to other multi-paradigm languages --- that are typically designed within one paradigm and later bolt on some features of the other --- this project aims to put both paradigms on equal and fair footing by beginning with a logical core where both naturally arise.  The project's impacts are (i) to implement a single programming language with a unified design that applies state-of-the-art theoretical research to derive expressive features from both the object-oriented and functional paradigms, and (ii) to develop new techniques suitable for extending existing, popular, programming languages with their missing features.<br/><br/>The language developed by this project is based on an understanding of duality that highlights the opposing forces in all computation: inputs versus outputs, call versus response, concrete structures versus abstract patterns.  This understanding is based on timeless ideas from a classical logic known as the ""sequent calculus,"" using the Curry-Howard correspondence as a mechanism to transfer ideas from logic to computer science.  In this sense, the novel programming ideas implemented here were already discovered, tested, and hardened independently in proof theory, and this project gives them a fresh perspective.  The logical foundation of this project is closer to a low-level machine --- making it easier to talk about performance --- while also giving increased expressive power for programming --- via novel organizations of information and control flow, and advanced tools for understanding behavior.  Thus, the project aims to strike a balance between the conflicting goals of flexibility --- a hallmark of scripting languages which let programmers modify the fundamentals of the language themselves --- and predictability --- a necessary resource for compiling efficient and well-behaved programs.  Special attention will be given to address ubiquitous programming challenges including modularity of compositional components, communication of complex messages between independent entities, and regulating the state of resources limited by time or space.  As a side benefit, this methodology may open up a path toward merging the object-oriented paradigm with the proofs-as-programs approach to formally verifying properties of complex software systems and mathematical theorems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key novelty of the project is a principled approach to tackle the availability challenges of CPS by systematically addressing threats from different vulnerable layers that make up a computer system. The project's broader significance and importance lie in the development of new theories and systems for system availability, building the foundation for security and safety in CPS, which our society now relies on for daily necessities. This project broadens participation not only in the field of CPS security but also in computing, through integrated educational activities for students from all backgrounds in both K-12 and higher education. <br/><br/>Threats from different layers of computing against system availability motivate the research thrusts in this project, advancing three lines of defense. The first line of defense tackles the long-standing problem of availability in trusted execution environments to provide computational and input/output (I/O) availability in the presence of an untrusted operating system (OS) while minimizing the trusted computing base by leveraging the unique predictability of real-time CPS. The second line of defense tackles a new dimension (availability) in software protection by leveraging context-sensitive software compartmentalization and rapid recovery to preserve safety-critical process availability at the cost of functionality reduction. The last line of defense formalizes, analyzes, and isolates the performance interference as a security (availability) problem, thwarting attacks from the non-safety-critical processes to the safety-critical processes.

Developmental gene regulation is largely made possible by many protein complexes that turn genes on or off at appropriate developmental windows. An important example is the Polycomb Repressive Complex, which turns off a specific set of developmental genes. How this complex selects the correct genes to silence during early development is still unknown. This project will utilize the fruit fly as model organism to study the role of this silencing complex in orchestrating developmental gene expression. Discovering the mechanism by which Polycomb Repressive Complexes silence genes in the fruit fly will inform our understanding of development in mammals. Another significant goal of this project is to increase the participation of persons traditionally excluded because of their ethnicity or race (PEERs) in undergraduate research experiences at Emmanuel College. Student researchers will use genetic, molecular, and biochemical techniques to address the aims of this project. Collaborations with researchers from Harvard Medical School and Brandeis University will facilitate engagement of PEER undergraduate students with the broader scientific community. The goal is to inspire larger numbers of PEER students to pursue careers in STEM.<br/><br/>Multicellular development is governed by the deployment of cell-type specific transcriptional programming, in which a single genome is utilized distinctly over time and space as cells multiply and specialize. This phenomenon is achieved by the precise coordination of gene expression that initiates the differentiation of the different cell types of an organism. Chromatin regulatory factors have been found to be essential for regulation of developmental transcriptional programming however the mechanism behind how these factors coordinate gene expression during embryonic development remains unclear. One highly conserved chromatin regulatory system that plays a central role in developmental patterning and cell differentiation includes the Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins. These proteins are typically found in two distinct types of Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs): PRC1 and PRC2. The PI's lab recently identified variant PRC1 (vPRC1) complexes in Drosophila that have strong modular conservation with mammalian complexes, suggesting an ancient functional diversity. The goal of this work is to understand the role of vPRC1 complexes in coordinating the cell-type specific transcription critical for normal development. In this project, undergraduate student scientists will functionally characterize one of the vPRC1 complexes using a variety of methods, including crosslinking, tandem affinity purification, and integrated analysis of protein partners and DNA binding sites, in parallel with functional genetic approaches to dissect the changes in protein complexes during normal development in Drosophila. Successful completion of this proposal will provide mechanistic details for function of a variant PRC1 complex in developmental gene regulation. Resulting insights will prove useful for future analyses in mammalian cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as more CO2 dissolves in the sea, the ocean water becomes acidified because CO2 is a weak acid. We call this change ocean acidification (OA). OA has a significant and lasting impact on marine life, as acidified water causes shell dissolution for numerous marine species. US society is already grappling with the adverse effects of OA. OA is predicted to lead to economic losses of $400 million annually by 2100 for the US shellfish industry. Therefore, it is urgent to understand how OA is changing and the potential approaches to managing it in coastal waters. Presently, we do not have a good understanding of OA change at either the large or the small scale because so many competing processes impact OA. <br/><br/>One of the most dramatic processes that affect ocean acidification (OA) is the extra nutrient loading from rivers due to human inputs. While moderate nutrient levels are necessary to support marine life, nutrient levels that are too high can cause oceanic plankton blooms. As plankton die, they sink to the seafloor, where they are decomposed by bacteria and speed up OA where shellfish live. In recent decades, management agencies have been working on improving water quality by reducing the nutrient input to coastal waters, which has the potential to reduce the OA even though OA is not the initial motivation. To our knowledge, there has yet to be targeted research to understand how OA responds to aggressive nutrient reduction. The average nutrient input to Narragansett Bay? one of the most rapidly warming estuaries in the US?has been reduced over one-third in recent decades because of intentional nutrient reduction. Therefore, Narragansett Bay can be considered a natural laboratory that can help in better understanding the OA change that other coastal areas may soon experience resulting from environmental management actions and climate change. This project will leverage the existing water quality monitoring network, collect new data, and utilize a coastal biogeochemical model to quantify OA change and the mechanisms driving its change in Narragansett Bay, RI. Through engagement with the public and local shellfish growers, we will increase their awareness of OA and enhance their ability to carry out ongoing or new aquaculture operations in the near and long term. As more US states reduce nutrient input to improve coastal water quality, this project will allow management agencies nationwide to make next-generation refinements to best limit OA for sustainable fisheries and wildlife in the face of climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to provide a solution to this issue by utilizing existing test code to design the voice assistant features. Test code is a series of simulated user interactions with an application that is used to validate the functionality of the application. By reusing the test code and mapping it to the corresponding voice query, the developers can quickly incorporate voice assistant capabilities into their applications. As a result of this project, developers will be more likely to redesign their existing code to accommodate such new voice interactions.  Furthermore, this project will bring many training and educational opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. It has the potential to support thousands of mobile developers in adding voice assistant options to their applications. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigator aims to answer the question of whether and how existing graphical user interface (GUI) test code can be adapted to develop voice assistant features in mobile applications. The investigator will begin by extracting the general functionality from a specific functionality instance in a GUI test code. The investigator will study how to differentiate the general code and non-general code in GUI test code, and develop automated techniques to detect them. The investigator will also investigate how to convert the general functionality into a reusable code template for voice assistant feature development. Second, the investigator will study how to represent the code template using human-understandable language and create potential voice query templates based on this language. A map will be created to connect the voice query template with the code template. Finally, the investigator will develop techniques to facilitate mobile applications in executing the code template in response to a particular voice query.

The conference will focus on developing connections between trisection theory, an emerging area of research in four-manifold topology, and the study of the topology and geometry of symplectic four-manifolds. It will catalyze research developments by bringing together mathematicians of all career stages ? including established experts, early-career researchers, and students ? and will have a number of features that are designed to actively engage the participants. First, there will be pre-workshop, virtual, introductory mini-courses given by experts in the field and designed to preview and motivate the central topics of the workshop. Second, there will be both plenary talks and shorter, lightning-style talks aimed at highlighting recent developments by a wide range of researchers during the morning sessions. Third, the workshop will feature afternoon working-group sessions in which participants will collaborate on open problems relating to the theory of trisections and symplectic topology and geometry of four-manifolds.<br/><br/>Symplectic geometry originally arose from Hamiltonian mechanics but has since developed into a rich field of its own with applications to several areas of mathematics, such as complex geometry, algebraic geometry, exotic smooth structures on four-manifolds, singularity theory, dynamics, and mirror symmetry. Despite decades of development and many seminal advances, seemingly basic problems ? such as the symplectic isotopy problem ? remain wide open. Trisection theory provides new combinatorial methods to study symplectic manifolds and offers a new perspective to shed light on difficult open problems. This provides a starting point for many new directions and applications and a rich opportunity for making advances through the synergy of these two fields. In the ten years since its introduction, trisection theory has developed to touch nearly every facet of four-manifold topology ? from comparing smooth structures and introducing new invariants to representing knotted surfaces and describing surgery operations. The workshop will build on recent successes of the theory highlighting the interplay between the symplectic and complex geometry of four-manifolds and the combinatorial features of trisections. These include: a characterization of symplectic surfaces in the complex projective plane as those admitting transverse shadow diagrams; a proof of the existence of trisections on symplectic four-manifolds that are compatible with the ambient symplectic structure; and an established correspondence between certain complex curves in the complex projective plane and hexagonal lattices on the torus that yields a combinatorial approach to the symplectic isotopy problem.

However, many popular reinforcement-learning methods often fail to converge, making the use of reinforcement learning in practice more an art than a science. This project will explore a novel approach to analyzing and designing convergent reinforcement-learning methods based on a recently discovered connection to gradient descent. This connection will not only improve the analysis of existing algorithms but also lead to the development of new methods.<br/><br/>This project builds on a novel concept, gradient splitting, which allows classical reinforcement-learning methods to be viewed as modifications of stochastic-gradient-descent updates, which inherit many key properties of gradient descent. We will use this connection to develop variations of temporal difference learning and Q-learning which, when given a dataset sampled from a Markov decision process, will converge geometrically to the statistically optimal estimate of the true value function. Coupled with neural-network approximation, our methods will approximate the true value function with an additional error that is inversely proportional to a power of the width of the underlying neural network.

Land transformation, overexploitation of natural populations, and exotic species invasions are driving global changes that impact biodiversity and quality of life. Woody vines, known as lianas, are structural parasites that use the structure of nearby trees to gain access to the sunlit canopy and can cause damage or death to the underlying trees. Understanding how these plants access resources such as light and water can inform strategies to control their spread. This project will compare physiological processes, such as photosynthesis and hydraulics, of invasive and native woody vines to characterize traits that contribute to their successful establishment in forested areas. This research will enhance the research skills of undergraduate students via its integration into a plant physiology class and independent research projects at Vassar College, a primarily undergraduate institution. Students involved in the project will do scientific communication outreach to local schools, allowing the students to improve communication skills and improving access to science and its applications at the K-12 level. Research sites will include identified urban forests of Poughkeepsie, NY to inform restoration and conservation plans in large city and town parks. This project will include presentations to local community groups, as well as city parks and planning departments, to encourage community involvement with invasive species control.<br/><br/>Global ecosystems are under pressure from many factors including climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, and biological invasion. As non-native plant species compete with native species for resources, understanding their physiology can improve predictions of competition and environmental responses to inform conservation decisions. Introduced temperate lianas, such as Ampelopsis brevipedunculata (porcelain berry) and Celastrus orbiculatus (Asiatic bittersweet), have been identified as invasive species of concern in the eastern United States. Since they require proximity to trees in order to access the canopy, lianas often germinate in the lower light intensities of the forest understory and must respond quickly to available light to maximize growth. Understory light occurs in patches of intermittent duration and varied size, so maintaining photosynthetic assimilation rates and water use efficiency during these sunflecks is essential for success. The objectives of this proposal are three-fold: 1) to compare photosynthetic and morphological characteristics of competing native and non-native lianas under varied light conditions, 2) quantify the growth traits, biomass allocation, anatomy, and hydraulics of the study species, and 3) investigate light acquisition and hydraulic strategies of these plants under water deficit to simulate climate change scenarios. Complementary measurements of photosynthetic assimilation, alongside rapid chlorophyll fluorescence and stomatal conductance measurements, will allow the researchers to characterize several traits, including maximum rates of electron transport and carbon assimilation, conductance of CO2 through the stomata and into the leaf, and non-photochemical quenching. Studies of the plants? anatomy and hydraulics will improve understanding of the different species? responses to variable environmental conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over time, this accumulated snow condenses to form glacier ice. Firn is a highly porous middle stage between snow and ice which often stores surface meltwater in its pore space.  Unfortunately, we don?t have a good estimate of how much meltwater is stored in firn, how this water storage varies from glacier to glacier, or how this storage amount is changing due to climate change.  This project will determine several firn properties such as firn thicknesses, pore volume, water storage, and changes in water storage over time across the Juneau Icefield located in Southeast Alaska. We will use field observations and modeling to answer these questions and to estimate firn properties more broadly across Alaska and Canada.  This is important because Alaska and Canada glaciers are retreating (melting) faster than any other glacier system on Earth. Therefore, we expect changes in meltwater storage to occur.  Meltwater stored in firn has the potential to raise sea level by a significant amount and impact other Earth systems such as ocean microscopic life forms and fisheries if it is rapidly released from glaciers.  We will use results from this project in an interactive educational video game we build for classrooms and the Mendenhall Glacier Visitors Center which receives over 600,000 visitors per year. We will train hundreds of students to use the game and help with further game development.  Lastly, this project will partially support an annual Culture Camp with indigenous communities in Alaska and Northwestern Canada where strategies for reducing impacts from environmental changes will be developed.<br/><br/>This project will quantify spatial and temporal variations in firn thickness, density, porosity, water content, and volume change, across the Juneau Icefield (JIF) in Southeast Alaska and Northwest Canada. We will use a range of observations acquired during this project, previously acquired data, data assimilation, and modeling, to understand the impacts of firn volume change on meltwater storage, meltwater flux, and down-glacier impacts from changing meltwater processes. We have selected the JIF for this study because it is an appropriate analog to thousands of temperate glaciers across the globe experiencing firn loss and thinning.  This research will characterize spatial and temporal variability of meltwater and meltwater movement within firn over hourly-to-yearly timescales and cm-to-km spatial scales, resolutions rarely achieved across any glacier system. Temperate firn is poorly constrained and densification models of firn do not yet incorporate empirical observations of melt. Additionally, spatial data on firn thickness, changes to firn volume due to glacier retreat, and the associated changes to firn meltwater storage and down-glacier meltwater flux (thereby influencing down-glacier ecosystems), are largely unknown. This proposal will help tackle these challenges. This is important because Alaskan and Canadian glaciers are retreating faster than any other glacier system on Earth, so we expect changes in firn meltwater storage to occur.  Meltwater stored in firn has the potential to raise sea level by a significant amount and impact down-glacier terrestrial and marine ecosystems due to climate change. As part of this project, we will build an interactive educational video game for use in classrooms and the Mendenhall Glacier Visitors Center (>600,000 annual visitors). We will also train over 500 students to use the game and help with further game development.

Although the cost is huge, numerous patients fail to get timely and effective medication cure. Accurate diagnosis is critical in clinical decision making. However, ?prevention is better than cure? as prevention and early intervention will prevent the aging people from suffering more diseases and/or more extensive treatments. Also, it is too late to build the prediction model when a lot of patients have been observed in the late stage of a progressive disease, which severely damages their health. Meanwhile, in order to be usable by healthcare providers, the prediction model needs to be interpretable and trustable. Also, efficient interaction between human stakeholders (e.g., developers, domain experts and/or end-users) and clear model interpretation not only improve the model performance but also enhance human trust. The proposed research project aims at developing algorithms and methods that support implementation of trustworthy and time-efficient data-driven decision making for prevention and early intervention.<br/><br/>The main approach proposed in this project is interactive explainable deep survival analysis. Survival analysis aims at predicting the time to event of interest, which is extremely beneficial in healthcare for modeling disease progression, identifying prognostic factors, assessing risk of health. This project will build deep survival analysis models in healthy aging and precision medicine to support clinical decision making, especially in the early stage of a progressive disease before a lot of patients have been suffered from that disease. Deep survival analysis is a kind of ?black box? model that stakeholders cannot tell how the model operates and how it comes to its decisions and hence limits its usage in practice. This project will develop methods to achieve both transparency and trustworthiness in deep survival analysis models with encoding of domain knowledge and expert feedback to achieve better prediction performance. More specifically, this project will propose a time-dependent counterfactual gradient integration to interpret what makes the model output differentiate from the counterfactual survival status at each time interval. This project will also incorporate feature attribution priors into the training process of deep survival analysis model to improve consistency of the explanation as well as the performance and trustworthiness of the model. Inspired by human-in-the-loop, this project will further investigate efficient schemes to mathematically formulate physicians' qualitative feedback, and interactively incorporate them in the learning process of the model with powerful perceptual user interface to efficiently encode diverse types of feedback from physicians.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These events are powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy stored in electric currents flowing in the coronal magnetic field. Basic questions about these currents remain: How do coronal currents evolve to become unstable in the lead up to such events? And how do these currents evolve to release magnetic energy during flares and CMEs? This project addresses these questions through modeling and analysis of coronal extreme ultra violet (EUV) images. The broader impacts include mentoring of undergraduate students and collaboration between US and Australian institutes. Outreach will be conducted for the Great American October 2023 and April 2024 solar eclipses. <br/><br/>This project will employ Gauss?s separation method ? which has a long heritage in terrestrial and planetary magnetism ? to photospheric vector magnetograms (2D maps of the 3-component magnetic field) of solar active regions (ARs). The core idea of Gauss?s method is that the photospheric field can be unambiguously partitioned into three distinct parts, each with its own source: currents below the photosphere, currents above it, and currents passing through it. We refer to the part of the photospheric field due to coronal currents as the ?photospheric imprint? of these currents. Photospheric imprints, by themselves, cannot fully reveal the nature of coronal currents. Nonlinear, force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations have previously been used to study coronal currents, but fields on these models? bottom boundaries typically exhibit substantial inconsistencies with magnetogram fields. While both methods have limitations, combining them can substantially improve our under- standing of coronal currents. Accordingly, the project will exploit both approaches in case studies of flare- and CME-prone ARs, to investigate the structure and development of coronal currents. The team will analyze evolution in photospheric imprints and NLFFF models before and after flares/CMEs, and in quiet epochs to establish baseline rates of change. Coronal EUV images will also be studied for context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To create such a network, existing state-of-the-art information-processing quantum hardware, such as ionic processors, must be accompanied by developing adequate interconnects to allow the scalable integration of multiple processors as nodes in the more extensive cooperative network. For this integration, fiber optics, the workhorse of digital communication, needs to undergo a quantum-enabling transformation. This grant will pursue the manufacturing of custom fiber that is capable of lossless translation of quantum-coherent information from the stationary form encoded on the ionic qubit processor into the flying qubits transmitted by photons through the communication links and vice versa. This research will deliver the optimized design for scalable manufacturing of a new class of fibers, in which linear ion arrays are integral sections of the fiber light-guiding core. Such a contiguous integration of the stationary-qubit processors into the optical path of the flying-qubit streamline will enable the unification of isolated processors into a synchronized network capable of performing information processing tasks of a respectively scaled-up complexity. The project's educational component will focus on outreach to attract underrepresented groups to pursue education in Quantum Information Science and launch the internship program in Quantum Manufacturing in industries focused on rekindling domestic manufacturing.<br/><br/>The grant will advance the manufacturing engineering research of a high-fidelity Ionic-Photonic Quantum Information Converter (IP-QIC) integrating ionic processors into a scalable quantum network. It will explore the theory-to-practice optimization of the fabrication of fiber-optic systems in which arrays of trapped ions replace sections of optically guiding core. Combining a thermal draw of fiber, in which a quadrupole of electrodes is concentric to the optical core, followed by selective etching of axial gaps in the fiber cladding, and controlled reflow by a capillary instability of the resulting gap-edges into micro-lenses, a fiber system in which multiple Paul traps can be house axially along the fiber will be fabricated. The Paul traps will be loaded in Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) with linear ion arrays concentrically aligned with the optical cores of the fiber, integrating them into a single quantum-coherent system. The fiber-optic theory claims no cut-off for the fundamental guided optical mode for any cylindrically symmetric system of refractive index higher than its environment, such as that of a linear ion array in a vacuum. Thus, a fiber system in which the ion arrays are the integral sections of the optical core, forming an uninterrupted, continuous lightguide, is possible. Such a seamless arrangement is expected to boost interaction efficiency between the photonic and ionic qubits, resulting in a conversion of quantum information back and forth between those two physical forms. The project will classify the cutting-edge fiber manufacturing approaches for precision in materializing the quantum-information systems of increasing complexity. IP-QIC is a novel physical arrangement that opens for experimental investigation hitherto unexplored correlation terms in the overall Hamiltonian of the system, describing the coupling of the fiber's optical modes to the ion array's phononic and excitonic states. Thus, IP-QIC will open a niche in quantum algorithmics, exploring the behavior of complex quantum matter, such as strongly correlated and topological, as well as data routing protocols for robust and extensible software-defined quantum networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These particles, when propagating to the Earth, create risks to astronauts, electronics onboard satellites, and to other human-built infrastructure and technology. Previous studies have suggested that SEPs can even influence Earth?s climate. As these particles precipitate down in the Earth?s atmosphere, they deposit their energy through ionization, modify atmospheric chemistry, and lead to cloud formation. The coupling between SEP-related space weather phenomena and tropospheric climate can be essential for the human environment, and this coupling exists, in part, through the Global Electric Circuit (GEC). A thorough understanding of this coupling requires a thorough understanding of how the GEC responds to SEPs and Forbush Decreases (FDs), and requires collaborative efforts from researchers from heliospheric physics, cosmic ray physics, and atmospheric physics. This project is an interdisciplinary study to increase understanding on how SEPs affect the GEC and terrestrial weather or climate.

Hendon of the University of Oregon is studying photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction mediated by transition metal clusters. Carbon dioxide reduction is an important chemical reaction because it can reduce atmospheric CO2 levels, while also forming valuable products like formic acid and formaldehyde. CO2 conversion is a difficult chemical transformation because the desired products (e.g. formic acid and formaldehyde) are formed in competition with one another, differing in the number of protons and electrons required to form them. To overcome this problem, Dr. Hendon will use computational modeling to study photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with inorganic clusters, which will provide precise numbers of protons and electrons for the reaction. The research will examine how these metal clusters can be used to starve hydrogenation reactions of reactants (H?) to select for target products, and demonstrate that the ligands that support the metal clusters allow for energetic tuning of the metal sites. If successful, this work has the potential to guide experimentalists to achieve more selective conditions for CO2 reduction to the desired product. Moreover, this computational work  may prove useful in other problematic hydrogenations, plagued by selectivity issues, including the regioselective reduction of alkenes and alkynes. This work will synergize with Dr. Hendon?s existing program in electrocatalysis of beverage extracts, a successful program that teaches fundamental chemistry and physics through the lens of coffee. This award will support the development of a formal curriculum for non-traditional students, that will be made open-source and community-maintained.<br/><br/>While the the all-important CO2 reduction reaction can be promoted through conventional hydrogenation with H2, selectivity can be achieved by using other H-sources. One promising route involves transfer hydrogenation, whereby hydrogen commutes from one species to another. This proposal seeks to demonstrate that selective CO2 transfer hydrogenation (reduction) can be achieved using atomically precise inorganic clusters in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In this award, Dr. Hendon will use computational chemistry to examine a family of heterogeneous polynuclear transition metal catalysts and will study the general mechanism in which hydrogen is extracted from donors (e.g. alcohols, water, etc.) and transferred to acceptors (e.g. CO2). The reaction mechanism likely depends on differences in pKa of the donor/catalyst/acceptor, as well as their redox potentials. From these studies, the Hendon group will search for target MOF clusters with improved chemical selectivity with tunable numbers of available hydrogen atoms through cluster modulation. Together, these studies aspire to yield a general design principle for selection of donor, acceptor, and MOF-based catalysts, based on electron energy alignments. Through collaboration with experimentalists the work aims to generate a family of CO2 reduction photocatalysts that source their H? from abundant donors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A machine-learning model is usually ""trained"" to perform the designated task. This training is done by feeding many data samples to the model and using algorithms to adjust the model parameters so that its output is consistent with the provided training output most of the time. There are many challenges to performing this task reliably and efficiently. Recent research has shown that making small changes to the data points can lead to misdetection. Therefore, it is critical to make learning models robust against such data perturbations, especially in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. This project aims to achieve this for a specific category of data perturbations called ""sparse attacks."" Sparse-attack scenarios are those in which perturbations occur in only a few coordinates of the data, such as a few pixels in an image. Despite their importance and various real-world applications, sparse attacks have not been widely studied from a theoretical perspective.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to develop a theoretical framework for robust machine learning in the presence of adversarial perturbations that are bounded in L0 norm, or so-called sparse attacks. There have been significant theoretical studies on non-sparse adversarial attacks, but such fundamental understanding has been lacking for the sparse setting. This is partly due to the challenges in the L0 setting, namely, the L0 ball being non-convex and highly non-smooth. The first goal of this project is to study the fundamental limits of robust classification for stylized mathematical models. This will be done by proposing defense methods that are provably robust against L0 attacks, as well as proving converse results. Ideally, one aims to establish tight achievability and converse bounds asymptotically to fully characterize the optimal robust classifier. Motivated by practical considerations, the performance of the proposed defense methods in other scenarios will also be studied. In particular, this project explores the generalization properties of the proposed robust hypothesis class in order to study the effect of finite samples when the data distribution is unknown. Furthermore, the project consists of an evaluation plan to implement the developed defense mechanisms and analyze its performance in terms of learning a model which is robust against sparse attacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Science centers and museums play an important role in promoting science learning outside of schools. However, they are often perceived by communities historically and chronically marginalized in science as unwelcoming and/or culturally irrelevant. Merely increasing access for Indigenous communities is insufficient to promote equitable, affirming, and just engagement with science learning. Instead, asset-based approaches that center nondominant cultures are needed to advance more expansive and transformative models of science that promote rightful presence: the idea that visitors will experience a sense of belonging and respect. Building on a partnership between University of California?s Lawrence Hall of Science and mak-?amham, an Indigenous Ohlone cultural organization that empowers Ohlone people with a rich cultural identity, the project will engage Ohlone youth (ages 10-16) in iterative cycles of participatory design and prototyping to create immersive Indigenous science exhibit experiences using mixed reality technologies. In centering Indigenous perspectives within science and technology learning experiences and highlighting connections between Indigenous cultural identities and contemporary STEM career pathways, the project aims to reframe STEM learning to increase Indigenous youth?s rightful presence in informal STEM learning spaces, with the potential to lead to a more diverse STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The project team will employ participatory design-based research methodologies to investigate the following three research questions: 1) What are the outcomes of youth participation in the design of mixed reality exhibits? a) How do youth develop a sense of belonging, science identity, and STEM career interest, and in what ways do these make visible and amplify their rightful presence in informal science education spaces? b) How do youth deepen and construct new STEM knowledge through Indigenous Science-based participatory design? 2) How can a participatory design model be developed in ways that center Indigenous Science and contribute to Indigenous rightful presence in informal science education? 3) How can informal science educators be supported to make sense of and center Indigenous Science? In collaboration with an Ohlone Research Advisory Committee, the project team will analyze the following data: interviews with focal youth; artifact-elicited focus groups; ethnographic observations of design workshops and reflective conversations; and design artifacts gathered from youth design teams. By engaging a total of 70 Indigenous youth directly, project research will investigate the impact of the participatory design model on youths? STEM learning, science identity, and interest in STEM careers, and advance understanding of design practices that contribute to rightful presence for Indigenous youth. The research will also generate insights into how to support informal science educators in facilitating Indigenous-centered learning experiences. Project findings will be disseminated to informal science and technology learning communities to support principled adaptation of the Indigenous Science youth participatory design model in informal science education contexts.

These events are powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy stored in electric currents flowing in the coronal magnetic field. Basic questions about these currents remain: How do coronal currents evolve to become unstable in the lead up to such events? And how do these currents evolve to release magnetic energy during flares and CMEs? This project addresses these questions through modeling and analysis of coronal extreme ultra violet (EUV) images. The broader impacts include mentoring of undergraduate students and collaboration between US and Australian institutes. Outreach will be conducted for the Great American October 2023 and April 2024 solar eclipses. <br/><br/>This project will employ Gauss?s separation method ? which has a long heritage in terrestrial and planetary magnetism ? to photospheric vector magnetograms (2D maps of the 3-component magnetic field) of solar active regions (ARs). The core idea of Gauss?s method is that the photospheric field can be unambiguously partitioned into three distinct parts, each with its own source: currents below the photosphere, currents above it, and currents passing through it. We refer to the part of the photospheric field due to coronal currents as the ?photospheric imprint? of these currents. Photospheric imprints, by themselves, cannot fully reveal the nature of coronal currents. Nonlinear, force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations have previously been used to study coronal currents, but fields on these models? bottom boundaries typically exhibit substantial inconsistencies with magnetogram fields. While both methods have limitations, combining them can substantially improve our under- standing of coronal currents. Accordingly, the project will exploit both approaches in case studies of flare- and CME-prone ARs, to investigate the structure and development of coronal currents. The team will analyze evolution in photospheric imprints and NLFFF models before and after flares/CMEs, and in quiet epochs to establish baseline rates of change. Coronal EUV images will also be studied for context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Catalysis plays a significant role in energy, environment, and sustainability applications. Many chemical manufacturing and emission control processes use expensive precious metals as catalysts to accelerate desired chemical reactions. Because of their low abundance and high cost, the current industrial precious metal catalysts are not sustainable. The development of catalysts that make more efficient use of these metals may address this practical problem. Single-atom catalysts have been demonstrated for a variety of chemical reactions, but there remain many desired chemical reactions for which these catalysts do not provide optimum performance. Professor Liu and his research team are developing precision-designed dual atom catalysts that may provide the enhanced catalytic performance needed for those chemical reactions where single-atom catalysts do not. This project is addressing fundamental principles that govern the catalytic properties of catalysts and providing design tools for their further development, with potential long term practical applications of economic and environmental benefit. Broader impacts include incorporating research results in an annual Winter Workshop of High Resolution Electron Microscopy (attended primarily by graduate students from across the US), training of graduate and undergraduate research students, and mentoring of high school students through the SCience and ENgineering Experience (SCENE) program dedicated to providing cutting-edge science research experiences to high school students.<br/><br/>This research led by Professor Jingyue Liu of Arizona State University aims to develop a fundamental understanding of synergistic catalysis by supported heteroatom dimers ( for example PtPd, PtRh, PtCo, PtNi, PdCu, PtBi, PtSn, and CoCu). These dual atoms are localized to isolated, ultra-small metal oxide islands (for example CeOx or CoOx) which are uniformly dispersed on high-surface-area, robust supports. With such a catalyst design, it is expected that the interaction between two different metal atoms, placed in close proximity, can provide for unique catalytic properties that may significantly enhance catalytic activity and/or increase selectivity of the desired reaction products. The use of stable heteroatom-dimers as catalytically-active centers not only maximizes metal usage efficiency but also makes it possible to tune their catalytic properties for desired chemical transformations. This catalyst design strategy enables interactions between two different metal atoms and opens up design space for developing stable and well-defined heteroatom-dimer or dual-atom catalysts that possess advantageous catalytic properties. The heteroatom-dimer and dual-atom catalysts are being tested for CO oxidation, water-gas shift, reforming, and hydrogenation reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These Arctic pond habitats are hotspots for biodiversity and carbon cycling. Particularly, ponds are key emitters of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas that enhances climate change. This project will characterize the role of Arctic wetland ponds in regional land-atmosphere carbon exchange, estimate their contributions of CH4 to the atmosphere, and assess how they have changed over the past 50 years to better anticipate their future role in Arctic carbon cycling and feedbacks to climate. This project also has two major educational components: (1) train the next generation of scientists from underrepresented groups to design and lead Arctic fieldwork intended to deepen understanding of the Arctic system and (2) incorporate virtual reality, drone sensors, and machine learning into education to improve engagement in STEM and Polar Sciences. These student-technology interactions will spur creativity and innovation, providing them with a competitive edge for academic and industry positions. The broader impacts of the project include summer outreach activities with Alaskan Indigenous communities and a photo book design by students that portrays Arctic landscapes, Indigenous communities, and the threats of climate change through a cartographic perspective. The book will communicate and promote awareness about the Arctic region to a general audience.<br/><br/>Despite their importance to regional CH4 budgets, ponds have been generally understudied and thus, underrepresented in Arctic and global CH4 estimates and earth system models. Therefore, it is unknown how their evolution will impact future land-atmosphere carbon exchange and potential feedbacks to climate. This study will (1) establish a foundational understanding of surface-atmosphere carbon dynamics of polygonal ponds, (2) characterize the timing and pathways of CH4 emissions, and (3) unravel the evolution of ponds under climate change and its carbon implications. The use of cutting-edge technologies including eddy-covariance flux system, drone & airborne imaging spectroscopy, drone LIDAR, and deep-learning Artificial Intelligence will allow us to characterize bottom-up and top-down regional scale CH4 emissions from arctic ponds. In addition, this study will rescue historical records to better understand biogeochemical changes of ponds over the past 50 years to answer where, when, and how the evolution of these aquatic systems has influenced surface-atmosphere carbon feedbacks to climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A psychologically safe environment is characterized by people who feel safe to voice ideas and concerns, willingly seek feedback, have positive intentions to one another, engage in constructive confrontation, and feel safe to take risks and experiment, all of which are inherently risky interpersonal behaviors. In academic research environments, faculty have a major leadership role in cultivating a psychologically safe environment within research groups. While engineering faculty possess strong research skills, they often receive minimal to no training on how to effectively provide psychosocial support to graduate students and how to create a positive team climate. The literature suggests women and other underrepresented groups still frequently encounter ?chilly? academic climates in STEM, or experience a lack of sense of belonging, leading to negative outcomes such as increased psychological distress and/or a fear of intellectual risk-taking that is essential to learning, creativity, and innovation. These outcomes hamper graduate students? ability to fulfill their academic responsibilities, may dissuade them from continuing with their degree program, and contribute to a growing mental health crisis that is already plaguing graduate education. This study will further our understanding of psychological safety in academic research settings and inform the development of pragmatic strategies and interventions on how to cultivate inclusive, psychologically-safe research climates that support a wide-range of work outcomes. Identifying effective approaches to establishing psychological safety in graduate education contexts can lead to increased student learning and performance, which will support the professional formation of engineers and the production of innovative engineering research. Improved mentoring relationships and research climates will also support graduate student wellbeing, retention, and broadening participation. <br/><br/>The overarching purpose of this study is thus to further our understanding of psychological safety in engineering graduate research settings and develop proactive solutions that can further promote doctoral students? psychological safety in their research groups and mentoring relationship. Considerable research evidence in industry settings suggests psychological safety supports individual/group learning, performance, and innovation, and mitigates work-related stress. Yet there is no research that has been conducted to study the impact of psychological safety in research labs, nor how it is effectively developed by faculty. The proposed study leverages an explanatory mixed methods design coupled with longitudinal interviews. The explanatory mixed methods design will utilize surveys followed by two sets of interviews to examine the role of faculty mentorship in psychological safety of doctoral students in research groups and associated work outcomes such as learning and mental health. The survey will first characterize relationships between faculty advisor mentoring, doctoral student psychological safety, and subsequent positive and negative work-related outcomes and how these differ for students from different demographic backgrounds. The first set of interviews will  explore the relationships identified by the surveys (explanatory design). The longitudinal interviews will document the experience of incoming doctoral students who join a research group and how faculty advisors communicate policies, norms, and values that impact the psychological safety of research group members. The results of this research will be leveraged to develop educational resources, including scenario-based training workshops for faculty advisors to support research group psychological safety and an educational module for graduate students to learn about psychological safety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This issue has been exacerbated in decision making processes where a machine learning software learns from potentially unfair human decisions and makes potentially unfair predictions to guide future human decisions. One such example is the talent hiring process where a human resource person screens a list of candidate resumes ranked by a machine learning software to decide who deserves an interview. Human decision fairness is especially important in this scenario since (1) the machine learning software will inherit the bias when trained on unfair human decisions; (2) even with unbiased machine learning software, the final decisions can still be biased as long as the human resource person is biased. This project will approach this historically challenging issue from a different direction. It learns to model the human decisions with a machine learning software and utilizes the algorithmic bias of that software to detect bias in the human decisions. This work could potentially advance the equity process in many decision making activities such as talent hiring, credit card approval, and school admission.<br/> <br/>In contrast to most of the existing research focusing on improving algorithmic fairness, this work aims to isolate the algorithmic bias inherited from the training data (with human decisions as dependent variables) as an indicator for human decision unfairness. To do this, the project will use a novel technique to test fairness in human decisions. Specifically, machine learning models are trained on the human decisions under test with re-balanced class distribution in each demographic group, then tests the learned model with a regression test suite of comparative judgements. If the model fails the regression test, the human decisions it was trained on will be considered as unfair. While it is difficult to directly test whether a human has bias, it is easier to test whether a machine learning model makes biased predictions using comparative judgements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While superconducting quantum devices have reached a high level of maturity as a technology, coupling of qubits to one another to enable large-scale circuits for practical computation still remains a challenge. This project seeks to address this challenge by exploring a new approach for coupling superconducting circuits using a thin electromagnetic coupler interposed between qubit layers. The proposed work will be based on an innovative integration of quantum elements that are by themselves well-established in the PI?s and Co-PIs? labs. Successful performance of the proposed work will expand our knowledge of quantum states in superconducting devices and will result in the development of improved quantum manufacturing approaches of broad interest for practical quantum information processing technologies. The team is committed to mentoring graduate and undergraduate students and to broadening the participation of under-represented groups in quantum engineering. In addition, the PIs will be involved in outreach efforts aiming to raise awareness about physics, materials science, and mathematics to school students. A substantial part of this effort will reach out to school students from the local Native American community. <br/><br/>Developing new approaches to 3D integration of superconducting qubits is of crucial relevance for realizing high-depth circuits suitable for running practically relevant algorithms. Current coupling techniques for transmon qubits typically involve relatively large (millimeter-sized) coplanar resonators, while for phase qubits a variety of different capacitive or inductive coupling approaches are being investigated. No optimal solution has yet been identified for vertical expansion. Existing approaches are typically planar, due in part to limitations stemming from the technology used to create the qubit Josephson junctions (JJs) typically angle-deposition and controlled oxidation of the tunnel barrier. This results in low spatial densities for JJ circuits and coherence-limiting cross-talk. In order to address this challenge, the PIs will fabricate high-quality JJ array chips and link them vertically via waveguide arrays operating in the microwave frequencies. While each enabling component and manufacturing method has been demonstrated, their integration is a daunting task with high-risk and the co-PIs are uniquely positioned to tackle this challenge. Intellectual significance: the team?s vision of full-3D integration of JJs and cross-talk shielding is in its early stages and untested experimentally, yet presents a potentially transformative approach to solve, in a single stroke, the triple challenge of efficient superconducting circuit coupling, high-density 3D vertical integration, and cross-talk mitigation.  Additionally, the project will train graduate students in state-of-the art quantum device nanofabrication, advanced materials growth, and quantum transport. The PIs will also develop courses on quantum information sciences aimed at undergraduates and quantum engineering/manufacturing aimed at graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, it is common for RL algorithms to exhibit unstable and/or inefficient learning, which limits their applicability. Seeking to address this critical concern, this CAREER project leverages imitation learning (IL), or behavior copying, which is better understood and typically more stable. The project targets the unification of IL and RL into a holistic paradigm that can safely and effectively learn from, and outperform, existing solutions. This project will address outstanding knowledge gaps in both types of learning through a novel curriculum decomposition of the tasks, where simplified demonstrations are used to bootstrap the learner?s behavior. The project will also foster education and outreach activities. Specifically, it will enhance undergraduate STEM training by providing students with exposure to scientific research and knowledge discovery processes relating to safety-critical AI applications through an original multidisciplinary undergraduate engineering program. Moreover, it will facilitate a unique K12 outreach activity within a large minority (Hispanic/latino) community (Bryan, TX). The project will support and advance an existing research collaboration with an industrial partner in the context of defense technology. This collaboration, in turn, is expected to advance the US national defense.<br/><br/>This project will form the basis for a new research thrust in ML---one that combines IL and RL toward a holistic, robust, and safe learning framework. It will define and prove a no-regret bound on the training process within the Markov-Decision Process formalization. The approach is to reduce an IL problem to an RL one that includes a domain-independent curriculum-learning trajectory. The resulting algorithms and solutions are expected to achieve state-of-the-art performance in complex control domains as well as to deepen theoretical understanding of the potential and limitations of the resulting solutions. Specifically, the research seeks to prove conditions guaranteeing policy convergence and monotonic improvement during training. Moreover, the project will develop domain-specific adaptation to and analysis of real-world applications (autonomous driving and robotics testbeds) while providing stable and efficient RL from demonstrations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Constraining this critical climate metric, known as Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), is important for climate science and for robust decision making based on climate models. Past climate data and simulations are instrumental to estimating ECS. Yet, ECS likely changes with different climate background states. This state-dependency must be accounted for when deriving future-climate relevant ECS from past climate data and simulations. In addition to CO2 driver, climate is also altered by perturbations of the earth energy balance from changes in geography, topography, vegetation, and ice sheets, which modify climate background states, and consequently, ECS. This project aims to identify the physical mechanisms driving the state-dependency of ECS and quantify the role of non-CO2 drivers in altering climate and ECS. This will be achieved by combining existing model simulation, proxy data, new simulations, and statistical diagnostic tools for three past warm intervals (3.3 ? 3.0; ~16.9? 14.7 and ~50 million years) than can serve as analogous to future climate states. Concurrently, a series of education and outreach activities aimed at advancing climate education for students and the public are proposed. These activities include developing new teaching materials for a high school enrichment course on climate modeling, creating undergraduate and graduate research opportunities, and facilitating the sharing of knowledge within academia and between academia and the public through a workshop and a virtual seminar series.<br/><br/>By developing a non-linear framework to analyze paleoclimate model simulations of three well-studied Cenozoic warm intervals: the mid-Piacenzian (3.3 ? 3.0 Ma), mid-Miocene (~16.9? 14.7 Ma), and early-Eocene (~50 Ma) -- to 1), this project will transform our understanding of ECS by quantifying feedbacks that are responsible for the climate-state dependency of ECS and the roles of non-CO2 forcings in modulating ECS. The selected warm intervals bear many similarities to future climate, and therefore, are particularly useful for studying feedbacks that are relevant to climate projections. Furthermore, by combining multi-model simulations and proxy data within a state-of-the-art Bayesian framework, this project will develop proxy constraints for the state dependency of ECS and assess model skill. This line of inquiry is particularly timely as researchers strive to narrow the uncertainty of ECS of today?s climate. More generally, this research will provide new insights into the feedbacks that maintain greenhouse and icehouse climates. The proposed Bayesian method will also allow for the identification of regions where proxy data are particularly influential for constraining the ECS, which will help guide future data collection efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project develops new theoretical frameworks, analyses, and techniques for distributed computing and machine learning aiming to (i) accelerate the computation time by overcoming system bottlenecks, (ii) ensure accurate computation in the presence of hardware errors and faults, and (iii) enable data-processing approaches that adhere to data-privacy constraints. These attributes will be enabled by inducing a controlled amount of redundancy in computations based on coding theory - a field that has enabled modern data communication and storage technologies. To obtain a realistic understanding of what is possible in the long run, the developed techniques will be accompanied by fundamental bounds on the tradeoffs between computation accuracy, data privacy, error tolerance, and redundancy overheads. The project will disseminate outcomes and enable awareness of developed research to the broader scientific community through publications, tutorials, and curricular integration.<br/><br/>Coded computing is a sub-area of information and coding theory that induces redundancy into distributed computing. Coded computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to relieve straggler, communication, and data-privacy bottlenecks in large-scale distributed machine learning. Yet, state-of-the-art coded-computing techniques, mostly devised to enable exact reconstruction of the computation output, have fundamental efficiency limitations, particularly for nonlinear computation tasks. This project develops techniques for approximate coded computing, wherein the decoder aims to obtain the function output within a prescribed distortion limit, and data-privacy constraints are posed as limits on differential-privacy parameters. The research will be conducted in three closely connected thrusts: (i) coding schemes for fault-tolerant approximate matrix multiplication, (ii) coding schemes for fault-tolerant approximate nonlinear computations beyond matrix multiplications, and (iii) coding schemes for differentially private computations.

Often, they are found in binary systems (two stars orbiting each other). In such systems, the two stars can exchange matter as they age and change size. When white dwarfs gain material from a companion, they undergo explosions on their surfaces, known as novae, losing some or all of the gained matter to space. If such a white dwarf can grow in mass appreciably over many novae, it can be totally destroyed in a massive explosion known as a type Ia supernova. Type Ia supernovae produce roughly half of the iron in the universe and are used as distance measures in cosmology, but we do not fully understand what causes them. In this project, the investigator and a team of undergraduate researchers will use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software tool to study mass-gaining white dwarfs. They will clarify how nova explosions affect the long-term evolution of white dwarf masses. Additionally, they will investigate how X-ray emission from a nova may be used to measure the mass of the underlying white dwarf. Freely available educational activities utilizing MESA for use in undergraduate astrophysics courses will be developed.<br/><br/>This program will probe the effects of diffusion, rotation, and convective boundary mixing on the mass retention efficiency of novae. The group will investigate each mechanism individually before combining two and all three at a time. Since these mixing mechanisms can cause core material to be ejected in the nova event, they may lead to a net mass loss over a single nova cycle. This study will constrain what circumstances, if any, allow a white dwarf to grow to the Chandrasekhar mass from hydrogen accretion alone, shedding light on the Type Ia supernova progenitor problem. To aid in measuring white dwarf masses, the group and collaborators will analyse the MESA models with the open-source GYRE stellar oscillation software to determine if the dominant core oscillation modes in nova models match the observed oscillations in the post-outburst X-ray emission of novae. If such a link can be established, it would provide a robust measure of white dwarf mass and perhaps composition.

The first component of this project addresses data limitations which have thus far prevented wide-scale and systematic study of the political orientation of scientists by linking voter registration records with individual patent inventors and academic researchers. The second component of this project uses these data to (1) provide comprehensive descriptive statistics about variation in political orientation of scientists across knowledge domains, industries, firms, and geographic regions; (2) evaluate the impact of scientists? political orientation on mobility in knowledge space by evaluating changes in collaboration preferences driven by partisanship and its consequences for innovation outcomes; and (3) evaluate the impact of scientists? political orientation on mobility in physical space by evaluating changes across geographical regions driven by partisanship and the consequences of such changes for innovation outcomes.<br/><br/>To match voter registration records with individual patent inventors and academic researchers, we use data from multiple sources. We obtain voter registration records from L2, a commercial data provider who sources voter information directly from individual states. Data on patent inventors are collected from PatentsView, a USPTO database which disambiguates patent inventor names, and information on academic researchers are collected from Dimensions, a database containing information on more than 106 million academic publications and 1.2 billion citations. To address the primary matching challenge of limited overlapping information between these databases, we build on recent advancements in machine learning and statistical record-linking procedures that work by identifying matches and weighting these matches by the probability of observing such a match at random.

Current network infrastructure is showing signs that in the near future it won't be able to keep up with the growing demand or increased needs, such as having higher definition video calls with more participants and imperceptible delays in the communication.  While some solutions have been proposed to help solve this problem, they do so at the cost of compatibility, which would require rewriting a large body of software that has been developed and tested over the course of over a decade.  This proposal introduces a new way of thinking about the way network traffic is handled that will enable both forward and backwards compatibility with modern software while meeting the needs of applications.<br/><br/>In particular, this proposal introduces Transparent Network Acceleration (TNA), which is a novel architecture that decomposes Linux network functionality into fast-path and slow-path functions with explicitly optimized execution environments for each. TNA dynamically and automatically builds a minimal fast path that is instantiated and adjusted at run-time, leading to a transparently accelerated networking stack that fully retains the Linux networking interfaces. Two core mechanisms are introduced.  First, to create a highly efficient fast path, TNA automatically and dynamically instantiates only the part of the network stack that is used.  New techniques are introduced to introspect the Linux kernel, build a dependency graph of functions, and assemble and deploy an optimal fast path. Second, it targets two fast-path execution environments from a single source code description of modules: (i) the eXpress Data Path (XDP), for in-kernel processing, and (ii) a field programmable gate array (FPGA) based SmartNIC, for hardware accelerated processing. As part of these targets, the design of modules, the compilation to hardware or software, and synchronizing the state represent a novel and complete design flow. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of these two core mechanisms, we complete the project with a case study of automatically accelerating a selective forwarding unit (SFU) video conferencing network function deployed with considerations such as firewalling and container networking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enormous progress has been made through mathematical and algorithmic breakthroughs toward developing codes that approach capacity. Powerful channel codes are crucial in ensuring reliable communication for our connected society and its technological innovations. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the development of error-correcting codes: learn, using machine learning, the encoders or decoders in an end-to-end fashion. While it has not been easy to outperform decades of work in coding theory, some of these codes excel at practical blocklengths, some are able to achieve similar performance while offering robustness benefits, and some are able to dramatically outperform existing codes in channels with feedback. Such advances are part of a larger picture: machine learning is playing an increasingly important role in various pieces of the communication stack, particularly in the wireless domain. While deep-learned codes are explicitly given by the specific trained neural networks (often with a very large number of trained parameters), they have been met with skepticism, some of which at least stems from these deep-learned error-correcting codes being viewed as ""black boxes,"" with little so far beyond limited experiments to demonstrate when or why they perform well. Our research will help engineers understand, interpret, and trust the performance of deep-learned error-correcting codes. This project will ultimately help intelligently and carefully integrate them into the extensive body of theoretical research as well as practical systems. Further, it will advance the use of deep learning in other scientific fields by providing tools and algorithms that will enable the new machine-learned artifacts to be interpreted and related to existing formalisms. It is important to train our next generation of data-science engineers to critically interpret and understand what their systems learn: the proposed research will do so from a new, rigorous angle enabled by the quantitative nature of error-correcting codes, with precise metrics and accurate modeling of distributions and statistics. <br/><br/>We present a transformative research program that builds upon promising preliminary work that will lay the foundation for interpreting deep-learned error-correcting codes in a structured, formal manner. This interdisciplinary line of work merges aspects of coding and information theory, explainable artificial intelligence, deep learning, computational learning theory, optimization, system identification, and Boolean function analysis towards the following ambitious goals: 1) developing algorithmic tools for the interpretation of deep-learned error-correcting codes, 2) using these tools to understand deep-learned error-correcting codes, 3) providing a formal characterization of deep-learned error-correcting codes based on the experimental results, 4) using this to design improved deep-learned error-correcting codes, and 5) using the insights to improve traditional codes. Results obtained are expected to provide important new tools for explainable artificial intelligence in general and will allow us to broaden the research program to deep-learned codes for the network and joint source-channel coding settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the race to achieve autonomy can make autonomous vehicles increasingly susceptible to attacks on their sensors, communications, and control signals. This CAREER project will create an integrated research and education program focusing on the pressing need to make mobile dynamical systems (or agents) including autonomous vehicles resilient ? guaranteeing that they meet their intended objectives, even under sensing, communication, and control attacks. There are three core research objectives. The first involves designing a novel modeling and analysis framework based on game theory that factors in the inherent asymmetry when a single agent operates in adversarial environments. The second is to extend the framework to include cooperation and the use of learning between multiple agents to collectively minimize the impact of attacks. The third is to address the scalability challenge that arises in solving the resulting games with limited onboard computation. The proposed methodology will be evaluated through realistic emulations using a ground robotic testbed and scenarios with full-sized autonomous vehicles. The educational plan includes creating a pool of activities based on innovative games related to attack resilience that will combine engineering and the arts for effective student engagement and personnel training. Presentations to the public and law enforcement agencies will help shape future practices for root-cause analyses of security incidents and deter attacks.<br/><br/>This project will result in a holistic framework to study the mathematical underpinnings of security problems arising in multi-agent dynamical systems.

First, it will combine multi-agent security games and learning techniques to provide a novel solution to attacks that leverage environmental uncertainty. Second, this work will build on the progress in randomized algorithms to solve large optimization problems arising in multi-agent games. The approach will enable a new probabilistic paradigm for robust multi-criterion optimization and multi-agent learning. It will characterize the tradeoff between the system?s attack resilience and the computation involved.

Within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, watershed managers and landowners continue to struggle with reducing nutrient runoff, despite decades of initiatives to improve the health of the Bay. In recent years, as stakeholders have worked to implement better watershed management practices, there has been increased interest in wetland restoration as a tool to improve water quality, while also providing aquatic habitat and increasing biodiversity. Unfortunately, our understanding of how to optimize the placement and function of restored wetlands to improve water quality remains limited. In this project, the investigator will use a combination of intensive wetland monitoring and large-scale data analysis to better understand how to reduce agricultural nutrient runoff to downstream waterways under changing climate and land-use conditions. The project also has an outreach component that will involve development of a pilot Chesapeake Summer Water Institute program. The program will bring graduate student researchers together with Chesapeake Bay-focused agency staff and other stakeholders to facilitate exchange of information, the development of ?problem-focused? research teams, and the use of process-based and data-driven modeling approaches to answer questions regarding improvement of Chesapeake Bay water quality.<br/><br/>The primary objective of the proposed research is to better understand controls on fluxes of landscape nitrogen (N) to current and restorable wetland sites and, thus, to better predict the contributions of wetlands to water quality in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. To meet this objective, the PI will use MESA?a metabolite of the widely used herbicide metolachlor?as a novel tracer of agricultural nitrate to identify the extent to which wetlands across a range of land-use types and positions intersect N flux pathways, and to quantify the resulting magnitudes of wetland N removal. The PI will leverage hundreds of existing water-quality samples from the National Wetland Condition Assessment together with more intensive monitoring of MESA at individual wetland sites to better our understanding of the spatially varying connectivity of wetlands with both groundwater N fluxes, and thus to refine estimates of wetland N removal magnitudes and associated N2O fluxes. In addition, analysis of MESA chirality will be used to estimate fluxes of legacy N to existing wetlands, thus bettering our understanding of the contribution of legacy N to current water quality.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Division of Earth Science's Hydrologic Sciences program and the Division of Environmental Biology's Ecosystems Sciences program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Then, after advice is given, the advisee reports a new belief. Researchers can then study the effects of advice by looking at how the advisee?s belief changed. However, there is a potential problem with this setup. Making the advisee explicitly consider their expectation before receiving advice can change its effects, but there is no way to study how the advisee?s belief changes without knowing what they believed beforehand. This research uses cutting edge statistical methods to estimate advisees? prior beliefs based on other factors that are known about them, allowing researchers to understand the influence of advice under more realistic conditions, where advisees don?t have to directly think about what they believe before being advised. <br/><br/>The scientific term for situations where measurement affects subsequent behavioral processes is ?measurement reactivity?. This project?s approach to curing this measurement reactivity is to treat advisees? prior beliefs as missing data. Advances in statistical methods allow researchers to impute missing data with without bias under the right set of circumstances. These methods are typically utilized when data are missing incidentally, but this project will experimentally randomize when data are missing, ensuring the correct conditions for the imputation to work effectively. Because these advisees never directly report their prior beliefs, the researchers can study how advice utilization occurs in the absence of measurement reactivity. This work has important implications for how advisors can help advisees optimize their expertise in many real-life scenarios. The methodological innovation of using a planned missing data experimental design to cure measurement reactivity also has the potential to generalize to other scientific domains where it is a potential confound.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process can produce gases that damage the ozone layer. Halogenation in the ocean is not well understood because most halogen-containing molecules remain unknown. Understanding halogenation in seawater is key because: (1) it may control recovery of the ozone hole as the Montreal Protocol phases out the use of man-made ozone-depleting substances and (2) some halogen-containing molecules can contribute to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This CAREER research project will develop new analytical and data science tools that can be used to identify halogen-containing molecules in the marine environment. The research also contributes to public health because damage to the ozone layer in the stratosphere is known to increase risks for skin cancer and cataracts. This CAREER research project includes educational activities to improve scientific literacy and to train the next generation of scientists and policymakers. Project activities include: (1) cutting-edge research training for undergraduate and graduate students, (2) partnerships with high school teachers to develop teaching materials, and (3) building relationships with communities by working with established outreach programs led by the Texas Sea Grant Program.<br/><br/>The motivation for this NSF CAREER research project is that organic carbon (OC) halogenation simultaneously affects the carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry, contributing to stratospheric ozone depletion. The overarching research goal of this CAREER project is to identify the molecular-level chemical drivers of volatile and non-volatile halogenated organic carbon (VHOC and HOC) formation in the surface ocean. A series of laboratory experiments, student-led field observations, untargeted analyses using high-resolution mass spectrometry, and novel data pipelines will be used to achieve this goal through the pursuit of four specific research objectives: (1) identify OC moieties susceptible to halogenation, (2) identify VHOC precursor compounds in halogenation and assess production efficiency in single model compounds and complex mixtures, (3) identify HOC precursor compounds, trace HOC products, and predict their stabilities, and (4) determine the natural occurrence and chemical characteristics of HOC in the ocean. These research objectives are integral to the educational objectives. HOC characterization in the ocean will be achieved through annual undergraduate student-led cruises that will expose students to cutting-edge research. High school teachers will be funded in the summer to contribute to laboratory experiments alongside the Principal Investigator (PI) and graduate and undergraduate students. The collaboration between the PI and teachers will be used to develop high school instructional resources and classroom activities for a Marine Organic Biogeochemistry curriculum. Research results from this CAREER research will be synthesized and communicated via collaboration with the statewide network of the Texas Sea Grant agents, specialists, and communicators.

The proposal aims to study and address insufficiencies in current distributed storage system designs from several important aspects including their abstraction, performance, communication, and failure models. These insufficiencies typically arise from the conventional designs in distributed systems that were not prepared for today?s Internet scale. This research may produce a major impact on industry and society because distributed systems are the cornerstones of modern computing infrastructures such as cloud computing, serverless computing, and high-performance computing. In particular, this work will be done in collaboration with widely used distributed storage systems built in Microsoft, Google, MongoDB, and Cockroach. The PI is working with their department to broaden the course offerings with multidisciplinary courses in the general area of cloud computing, distributed systems, reliable systems, and software engineering. The PI will incorporate the topics in this proposal into the courses he is teaching.<br/><br/>Traditionally, systems often use a method called state machine replication (SMR) to achieve reliability. SMR is often treated as an independent module, with a clear boundary such as a key-value interface isolating it from the rest of the system. However, this creates problems in today?s systems. For example, using SMR as a blackbox in geo-replicated systems could incur a great performance penalty because each application request could translate into multiple SMR operations and each operation takes at least a wide-area round-trip to finish. This proposal summarizes four impediments of existing systems from different aspects in practice (abstraction, performance, communication model, and failure model), and proposes four research thrusts targeting these impediments: 1) use transactional data structures to enrich the abstraction layer between applications and the data store, 2) investigate leveraging multicore resources to improve performance for geo-replication, 3) study advanced SMR techniques under a more generalized communication model than the status quo, 4) study tolerating a new failure model, silent data corruption. The proposed work will develop a set of novel, transformative technologies, including a new replicated transactional data structure library that supports building general types of applications, other new system designs and implementations for providing fast and consistent replication that will be encapsulated in state-of-the-art research products and will dramatically improve the performance and fault-tolerance of modern distributed systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Workplace ostracism occurs when an organizational member is excluded or ignored by other people at work. Almost 70% of American employees have experienced workplace ostracism. The situation is worse among employees with a racial minority background, posing a tremendous challenge for organizational leaders who strive to promote an inclusive workplace in an increasingly diverse environment. This project investigates how employees respond emotionally and physiologically to workplace ostracism and the extent to which their racial background and cognitive attribution affect this process. Furthermore, the researchers determine the beneficial effects of relationship crafting, a proactive social behavior that helps ostracized employees to regain social connections, recover wellbeing, and restore performance. Findings of this project have important implications for policy and practice to improve diversity and inclusion in the workplace.<br/><br/>Using a multi-method approach, this project conducts three studies. First, using a vignette-based experimental study, the investigators examine the main and interaction effects of workplace ostracism and cognitive attributions on the victims? emotional strains. Second, employing a battery of laboratory tasks (Cyberball Game, Gift Card Task, and Trier Social Stress Test) and physiological measures (skin conductance level and heart rate variability), the investigators examine the distinct activities of sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system and the function of relationship crafting among ostracized individuals. Third, using the experience sampling method to collect multi-source data in a 10-week period, the investigators examine the fluctuations of workplace ostracism and employee responses that are otherwise missed by a between-subject design. Data is analyzed using multilevel modeling, Monte Carlo based confidence intervals, and multiple-group path analysis. Using a full-cycle design, the investigators ascertain the internal and external validities of the studies and develop a robust theory on workplace ostracism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From a health perspective, this is a missed opportunity; dietary self-monitoring is an effective way for people to reflect on and improve their eating habits, reducing the chance of developing costly diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity. This project addresses the weaknesses of existing dietary monitoring methods by advancing a new approach called Interactive Dietary Monitoring. The idea is to envision dietary tracking as a human-machine collaboration, combining the strengths of manual and automated food tracking. For example, people know what food they are eating, but can forget to make a note of it in the moment. Automated systems can detect when people are eating, but have limited insight into the identity of the foods. Thus, a collaborative approach can shore up the complementary weaknesses. To move this vision toward reality, the project team will prototype, evaluate, and refine novel wearable devices, algorithms, and visual interfaces for food tracking, with the goal of reducing the burden of dietary self-monitoring while keeping individuals aware of their eating behaviors. The devices and methods developed are likely to be useful for other pressing problems, including flagging behaviors associated with eating disorders and smoking events, measuring tremor in Parkinson?s disease patients, and helping nutritional epidemiologists understand the link between diet and disease.<br/><br/>This project will advance the fields of human-computer interaction and ubiquitous computing through (1) developing and evaluating algorithms to detect fine-grained finger motion and novel interaction techniques around diet tracking, (2) investigating sensing methods for alcohol drinking detection and food recognition from volatile organic compounds present in human breath, (3) producing new knowledge about developing wearable devices for dietary tracking, (4) exploring a new mobile food journal interface that leverages the relationship between color and nutrients to provide visual dietary insights, and (5) generating usability and algorithmic findings from the inclusion of older adults, seniors with chronic diseases, and under-represented individuals in studies. The outcomes of this proposal will be developed and assessed through a human-centered process consisting of formative studies, implementations, and evaluations in both controlled and naturalistic conditions. To enhance the impact and social reach of this research, the outcomes of the project will be embedded into graduate and undergraduate courses, the wearable platforms will be integrated into a science camp for economically disadvantaged students, and high school interns will play a role in the execution of the research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Artificial intelligence (AI) can and has already benefited tremendously from exploiting these symmetries. This project seeks to identify and exploit symmetries that are prevalent in cooperative AI tasks, where a group of multiple autonomous sequential decision makers, or agents, plan and learn to maximize their combined benefit. As an example, consider the application of adaptive traffic signal control, where each intersection can be modeled as an agent controlling its traffic signal in a way that adapts to real-time traffic conditions to reduce congestion. There exist certain symmetries when the topology of the road network is regular, e.g., as a 4-connected grid, and the road condition is uniform. When done properly, such multi-agent symmetries can be identified and exploited to greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the current solutions to cooperative AI. This project also integrates the proposed research into an array of education initiatives, playing key roles in the curriculum development and undergraduate research experiences at the PI's university, as well as outreach activities that bridge academia with industry practitioners and community stakeholders.<br/><br/>This research will establish a unified framework and develop a set of interdependent methods that formulate, identify, and exploit multi-agent symmetries for cooperative AI tasks. The research first adopts a mathematically rigorous language to formulate the notion of multi-agent symmetry into the framework of symmetric Markov game, revealing its core property which can be exploited by planning and learning methods. Then, the research plan concretizes how to exploit several most common types of multi-agent symmetries, including permutation symmetries, Euclidean symmetries, and hierarchies of multi-agent symmetries of mixed types. Next, the research plan discusses issues that are critical for practice, including identifying and exploiting approximate multi-agent symmetries and dealing with partial observability. Finally, the research features several real-world applications, including adaptive traffic signal control, automated circuit design, and material design, to evaluate and showcase the proposed methodology.

Examples include regular and electric bicycles, stand-up electric scooters, and 3-wheeled scooters equipped with seats.  Understanding how micromobility riders should behave to minimize conflicts with other constituents of urban traffic is essential. Using this understanding in the design of micromobility platforms and their interactions with the rider will improve safety and comfort in urban transportation and enhance public acceptance. Rider behavior is structured, consisting of maneuvers such as acceleration, turns, and dismounts and macroscopic behaviors such as the selection of locations to visit and paths to take.  Building structured models of rider behavior is necessary as the existing models are difficult to use for interpreting rider accountability, and whether behaviors are acceptable to the public. To address these challenges, this project proposes to design a novel Structural and Accountable micromobility Rider Behavior Understanding System (SARBUS). SARBUS will provide the micromobility rider behavior modeling through human-centered artificial intelligence. For concrete insights and prototype development, the project will focus on the increasingly popular stand-up electric scooters (e-scooters). The model development will use data from continuous multi-modal sensors collected during real-world riding scenarios. The principal investigator will recruit and train students from under-represented groups in research, and will use the project research to promote teaching and training through student mentoring, new course development, and outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project will be composed of two interleaved modeling thrusts. Thrust A will develop a reinforcement learning technique that interactively learns and captures the rider's macroscopic location visit and paths (through GPS logs) and microscopic maneuvering behaviors (through accelerometers and gyroscopes), as well as their structural inter-dependencies. This thrust will derive a graph representation that will be used by SARBUS to illuminate and explain the riders' decision-making process. Thrust B will build models from the motion sensor readings of the maneuver behaviors (accelerometers and gyroscopes), recorded (on-board) riding videos and the human textual annotations of those videos. These data will capture the interactions of the riders with other road users and the environment. This thrust will quantify the relationships across these modalities through graph learning, and the resulting models will reveal when rider behaviors create conflicts with other traffic elements, and identify rider accountability. The principal investigator will further conduct e-scooter rider case studies with SARBUS to understand how the structural rider behavior modeling and accountability interpretation can together benefit the riders in route selection and riding behavior with enhanced travel efficiency and fewer conflicts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ?carbon dots? are smaller than 10 nanometers in diameter and possess extraordinary properties that permit their use as light-emitting molecular ?beacons.? Carbon dots also possess an important, yet underutilized, characteristic that allows them to be detected using techniques that are analogous to medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The Whiting lab is leveraging these magnetic resonance properties to improve the synthesis and purification of carbon dots, as well as applying a specialized technique to temporarily boost their magnetic resonance (MR) signals by several orders of magnitude. These advances aim to diversify the types of systems that can be studied using carbon dots by enabling both fluorescence and magnetic resonance detection. In addition to increasing the recruitment and retention of female STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) majors from traditionally underrepresented populations, Dr. Whiting is also developing a new curriculum that provides hands-on learning about magnetic resonance techniques and guides students to effectively communicate science topics to the public.<br/><br/>While carbon dots possess many advantageous optical characteristics, the underdeveloped utilization of their inherent 13C MR properties limits their potentially broad applicability. The Whiting group is addressing this shortcoming by synthesizing 13C enriched carbon dots, using NMR for particle structure determination, devising and evaluating sample purification techniques. Furthermore, they are using dynamic nuclear polarization to enhance the 13C NMR signals of carbon dots by several orders of magnitude, enabling high-sensitivity MR-based chemical sensing in real time. These approaches can then directly translate to other MR-active nanomaterials to grow a versatile network of cross-disciplinary applications.

Good human-robot collaboration is key to realizing these promises. This project develops novel modeling techniques for analyzing and designing collaborative behavior in human-robot teams. Collaborative behavior requires adjusting to and communicating with each other.  Coordination and communication incur cognitive and temporal costs. In human-robot collaboration these costs can be high, as coordination with autonomous agents generally is more taxing and time-consuming than collaboration with other humans. The models developed in this project will identify the causes and effects of coordination costs in human-robot systems. Based on these models, the project develops techniques for managing coordination costs to avoid overloading human operators. Improved cost management will lead to more robust and resilient human-robot operations, broader adoption of smart robotic technologies, and realization of their promise. The project integrates the research with education and outreach activities to train the future workforce in systems thinking and interdisciplinary problem-solving skills. These skills will ready future engineers, researchers, and scientists to create integrated solutions to address complex challenges that span technological, human, ecological, economic, and policy dimensions.<br/><br/>This project develops a generalizable formalization for representing and analyzing joint activity in human-robot systems by combining theories from cognitive and social sciences with techniques from graph theory and agent-based modeling. This framework allows objective and dynamic analysis of the teamwork required to manage interdependencies between humans and robots. Based on the model, the research develops techniques for dynamically adapting and controlling coordination costs to improve collaboration and avoid lapses. The work will be validated in disaster response and space operations. The project addresses three fundamental research challenges: First, it determines the relation between a human-robot system organization, asymmetries in cooperative competencies, and cognitive and temporal costs of coordinating with robots. Second, it identifies control strategies for dynamically regulating coordination costs in human-robot systems. Third, it demonstrates the use of graph-theoretical metrics and algorithms to translate theoretical concepts of joint activity into actionable guidance for making robots more cooperative agents in dynamic environments. Findings will provide deep insight into what capabilities robots need to be endowed with to make them useful cooperative agents in context.

On the one hand, different devices are combined in one heterogeneous platform so that specialized applications (e.g., artificial intelligence) can execute more efficiently. On the other hand, the scale of devices and systems is getting much larger. The heterogeneity and the massive scale of computing systems make it challenging for researchers to understand, interpret, and explain the behavior of each hardware component that participates in application execution. The lack of explainability of existing computer architectures can potentially lead to functional bugs, performance drawbacks, security vulnerabilities, and reliability problems.

There are particularly high amounts of mercury in Arctic food webs due to the transport of mercury in the atmosphere to the Arctic, primarily from mining and industrial regions. The main source of mercury to the Arctic is thought to be human emissions to the atmosphere (for example, from processing of material in gold mining and fossil fuel burning), but there may also be large natural sources of mercury that could change with climate warming. Glaciers and ice sheets, large rivers of ice, have recently been identified in Greenland as possible sources of mercury to the Arctic through glacier physical grinding (as they bulldoze their way through the landscape) and melt, but data is still sparse and these existing datasets highlight significant uncertainty. In the MEGA project, the investigators will sample (i) a range of glacial meltwater rivers across Greenland, (ii) the oceans these meltwaters flow into, and (iii) the air next to the water sampling sites, to understand whether these natural mercury inputs are important and/or are likely to change with increased glacier melting in a warming climate. This new data will improve our knowledge of the importance of glaciers and ice sheets in the Earth System, and provide critical process information using modern measurement techniques. The MEGA project will ultimately help us understand how mercury moves and changes through Arctic systems. MEGA will support two PhD students, several undergraduates, and a number of early career scientific researchers. It will establish an international collaboration between US, Danish, German, Czech and Greenlandic researchers, and provide unique opportunities for teachers from under resourced high schools in West Philadelphia to participate in Arctic research. <br/><br/>Mercury is a toxic element that accumulates and magnifies in food webs, making it of particular concern to human populations. Concentrations of mercury in the Arctic region are of particular concern for policymakers because they are high in Arctic marine organisms. This is important for Arctic communities that rely on fishing and hunting for significant proportions of their diet. The major source of mercury to the Arctic is atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic mercury from lower latitudes (for example, from artisanal gold mining and fossil fuel burning), transported to the polar regions by prevailing atmospheric circulation. More recently, natural sources of mercury, such as from permafrost melting, have received attention as potentially important components of the Arctic mercury cycle that could change in a warming climate. However, large gaps in scientific knowledge surround these climatically sensitive but potentially significant natural sources of mercury, particularly glaciers and ice sheets. The Greenland Ice Sheet is by far the largest ice mass in the northern hemisphere, covering over 20% of the land surface in the Arctic. Recent research suggests the ice sheet may be an important source of mercury to surrounding ocean ecosystems, but the data is limited and additional research is needed. The MEGA project will produce the first complete model of mercury mobilization, movement and transformations from source (ice) to sink (ocean). The investigators will develop a robust numerical budget for mercury in Greenland by sampling (i) meltwater rivers flowing from the ice sheet, (ii) the coastal areas these rivers enter, and (iii) the atmosphere from where mercury can be deposited/transported. MEGA will use innovative methodological techniques like the chemical fingerprint of the mercury (e.g., mercury isotope ratios) to provide information that contextualizes the importance of the Greenland Ice Sheet processes in the Arctic mercury cycle. The MEGA project will support a diverse range of researchers, including undergraduate students, two graduate students, an early career postdoctoral researcher, and four early career faculty. The project will also develop collaborations, networking and capacity building between US researchers/institutions and researchers/institutions from Greenland, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Germany.

It will establish an international collaboration between US, Danish, German, Czech and Greenlandic researchers, and provide unique opportunities for teachers from under resourced high schools in West Philadelphia to participate in Arctic research.<br/><br/>Mercury is a toxic element that accumulates and magnifies in food webs, making it of particular concern to human populations. Concentrations of mercury in the Arctic region are of particular concern for policymakers because they are high in Arctic marine organisms. This is important for Arctic communities that rely on fishing and hunting for significant proportions of their diet. The major source of mercury to the Arctic is atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic mercury from lower latitudes (for example, from artisanal gold mining and fossil fuel burning), transported to the polar regions by prevailing atmospheric circulation. More recently, natural sources of mercury, such as from permafrost melting, have received attention as potentially important components of the Arctic mercury cycle that could change in a warming climate. However, large gaps in scientific knowledge surround these climatically sensitive but potentially significant natural sources of mercury, particularly glaciers and ice sheets. The Greenland Ice Sheet is by far the largest ice mass in the northern hemisphere, covering over 20% of the land surface in the Arctic. Recent research suggests the ice sheet may be an important source of mercury to surrounding ocean ecosystems, but the data is limited and additional research is needed. The MEGA project will produce the first complete model of mercury mobilization, movement and transformations from source (ice) to sink (ocean). The investigators will develop a robust numerical budget for mercury in Greenland by sampling (i) meltwater rivers flowing from the ice sheet, (ii) the coastal areas these rivers enter, and (iii) the atmosphere from where mercury can be deposited/transported. MEGA will use innovative methodological techniques like the chemical fingerprint of the mercury (e.g., mercury isotope ratios) to provide information that contextualizes the importance of the Greenland Ice Sheet processes in the Arctic mercury cycle. The MEGA project will support a diverse range of researchers, including undergraduate students, two graduate students, an early career postdoctoral researcher, and four early career faculty. The project will also develop collaborations, networking and capacity building between US researchers/institutions and researchers/institutions from Greenland, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Germany. MEGA will also embed two K-12 educators from Philadelphia in fieldwork to cultivate interests in STEM, Arctic research, and Earth systems science, helping inspire their teaching curriculum and their students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These forests are also the most impacted by changes to the climate, such as global warming. An increase in temperature may cause tropical soils to release more carbon dioxide, further contributing to warming of the atmosphere. This research evaluates how an increase in temperature can affect the release of carbon dioxide from soils, specifically carbon dioxide produced by soil microorganisms through a process called heterotrophic respiration. The research advances our understanding of the fundamental processes that regulate the functioning of soil microorganisms and their production of carbon dioxide, as well as the mechanisms that affect the ability of soils to store and stabilize carbon dioxide. The work has important implications for environmental scientists, engineers, and policy makers working to assess climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, such as reforestation and afforestation. The project supports the development of new interdisciplinary curricular material at the intersection of microbiology, hydrology, environmental science and engineering, engages middle and high school students around the impacts of climate change to tropical forests, and trains diverse students.<br/><br/>Iron is a relatively abundant mineral in humid tropical soils. This work evaluates how the interactions between iron cycles and soil carbon modulate the temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration over time. The research is guided by the hypothesis that short-term soil organic carbon decomposition through iron reduction increases the temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration. In the long-term, it is hypothesized that both microbial community adaptation and physicochemical protection of organic carbon by iron minerals reduce the temperature sensitivity. The project combines experiments and process-based modeling, leveraging the Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment (TRACE), a state-of-the-art field warming experiment in the Luquillo Rainforest in Puerto Rico. Comprehensive experiments with soils sampled from control and warmed plots at TRACE inform their biogeochemical response to temperature gradients and changing iron states. A process-based soil model is applied to analyze observations and mechanistically explain the response to changing temperatures. The project includes training at the undergraduate, graduate student and postdoctoral levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These enzymes work on cellular targets which are extremely small in size, oftentimes measured at the nanometer (one billionth of a meter) length scale. This CAREER project aims to understand the fundamental mechanisms of how enzyme-sensitive, nanoscale materials interact with an enzyme. This goal will be realized by developing nanoparticles, which respond to a particular class of enzymes by changing particle size and function. Further, these particles will mimic the function of a naturally occurring, enzyme-sensitive protein ? histone ? that is found in cells. The developed platform will therefore answer several fundamental questions related to enzyme actions at the nanoscale, such as (1) How nanoparticles selectively interact with a target enzyme and reject interactions with other macromolecules in the complex biological environment ? and (2) How to regulate the rate and extent of enzyme responsivity of nanoscale materials via engineering their size, shape, surface properties, and chemical composition? An in-depth understanding of the structure and function of enzyme-sensitive nanoparticles will open the gateway to designing smart nanomaterials capable of selectively recognizing a specific enzyme. These nano-platforms would then provide tools and techniques to prepare cancer drug delivery systems, diagnostic agents for neurodegenerative diseases, biosensing technologies, and mechanisms for pollution control. The educational goal of the CAREER project has three-pronged approaches centered on Tribal Colleges and Primary Undergraduate Institutes across North Dakota. The approach is aimed to increase inclusivity and minimize the loss of Native American students in higher education. The educational activity will include (1) peer-to-peer collaboration with at least eight Tribal College and Primarily Undergraduate Institution mentors over the project period to revitalize the learning resources of these institutes for STEM education, (2) curriculum development for the North Dakota State University engineering graduate program, and (3) increased research involvement of undergraduates from underprivileged areas across North Dakota. The research activity delineated in this project will thus expand the scope of training in nanoscale interactions and contribute to a robust supply of professionals needed in STEM research at the national level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to deconvolute and understand the events occurring when an enzyme interacts with an Enzyme-Responsive Polymersome. Polymersomes are nanoscale, membrane-bound vesicles formed via the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers that constitutes their membranes. Using a model enzyme with epigenetic activity, histone deacetylase,  the principal investigator aims to study the effect of chemical composition and nanoscale features of polymersomes that are capable of recognizing target enzymes and rejecting interactions with off-target biomacromolecules. Developing platforms to study enzyme interactions with dynamically-responsive nanosystems is challenging because (1) accessibility of an enzyme to its nanoparticle-bound substrates depends not only on the particle size and charge but also on molecular crowding and conformation; (2) the mechanism of enzyme interactions with substrates at the nanoscale is transient downstream of specific environmental cues, and (3) extracting molecular level structure/dynamics information at the nano-bio interface under the interference of surrounding molecules is non-trivial. Given the increasing need for biomolecular delivery platforms for therapeutics, agrochemicals, environmental remediation, and synthetic materials that mimic cellular organelles, there is a critical need to overcome these challenges. Three strategies will be realized to achieve the goal of this CAREER project: first, the PI will mimic the enzyme-responsivity pattern of a histone ? an acetylated lysine-bearing natural protein of well-defined size and structure, found in living cells that interacts with different epigenetic enzymes, such as histone deacetylase;  second, the mechanism of the enzyme interactions on this histone-mimetic nanoplatform, mediated by deacetylation reaction (removal of acetyl groups from primary amines of lysine residues) will be structurally followed and established. third, synthetic and experimental techniques capable of orthogonally detecting molecular-level interactions will be used to dissect the interactions of nanoparticles with enzymes in contact with each other. The central hypothesis of this research activity is that structural and functional changes of enzyme-responsive polymersomes in response to epigenetic enzymes are mediated mechanistically via the inversion of solubility of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic segment of the amphiphilic block copolymers in water and governed by the enzyme accessibility to its substrate located within the nanostructure. The main teaching philosophy of PI?s educational plan involves connecting with mentors serving tribal colleges and primary undergraduate institutes across the state of North Dakota via an immersive ?Mentor- to-Mentor? program for the continuation and reinforcement of STEM training in these institutes. Further, the research elements of nanoparticle-enzyme interactions will be bridged with engineering graduate curriculum development in the PI?s home institute that will be harnessed to improve enrollments of under-represented minorities in 4-year graduate schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students gain hands-on research experience using cyberinfrastructure and take brief focused classes in computer programming, 3D graphics, and human computer interaction. For the remaining time, students conduct interdisciplinary research projects in groups. The research projects are presented at an end-of-the summer campus-wide research symposium in the form of posters, demos, and a five-page research paper. SPIRE-EIT recruits with an emphasis on underrepresented groups, preparing students for graduate education in the interdisciplinary area of human computer interaction, an area of importance to the U.S. economy. By including instruction on ethics and on research-based evaluation techniques, the SPIRE gives students skills that are useful lifelong, independent of discipline, and which students might not otherwise encounter in a traditional engineering or computer science curriculum. <br/><br/>Two major trends are driving research in Emerging Interface Technologies: a dramatic increase in interface technologies themselves, and the ubiquitous permeation of technology into everyday lives. Correspondingly, research questions focus on four broad areas of emerging technologies: information visualization; mobile/ubiquitous interfaces; extended, virtual, and augmented reality; and intelligent software agents. These research questions will be explored through projects such as career pathways through immersive storytelling in XR, multiagent trajectory representation in XR, testbed for human-agent teaming behavior understanding, and adaptations to cybersickness. Research projects are designed so that undergraduates (in teams of three) can make a meaningful contribution. Faculty in Iowa State University's Human Computer Interaction graduate program compete to participate in the SPIRE and cite strong benefits from participation afterwards.

These forests are also the most impacted by changes to the climate, such as global warming. An increase in temperature may cause tropical soils to release more carbon dioxide, further contributing to warming of the atmosphere. This research evaluates how an increase in temperature can affect the release of carbon dioxide from soils, specifically carbon dioxide produced by soil microorganisms through a process called heterotrophic respiration. The research advances our understanding of the fundamental processes that regulate the functioning of soil microorganisms and their production of carbon dioxide, as well as the mechanisms that affect the ability of soils to store and stabilize carbon dioxide. The work has important implications for environmental scientists, engineers, and policy makers working to assess climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, such as reforestation and afforestation. The project supports the development of new interdisciplinary curricular material at the intersection of microbiology, hydrology, environmental science and engineering, engages middle and high school students around the impacts of climate change to tropical forests, and trains diverse students.<br/><br/>Iron is a relatively abundant mineral in humid tropical soils. This work evaluates how the interactions between iron cycles and soil carbon modulate the temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration over time. The research is guided by the hypothesis that short-term soil organic carbon decomposition through iron reduction increases the temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration. In the long-term, it is hypothesized that both microbial community adaptation and physicochemical protection of organic carbon by iron minerals reduce the temperature sensitivity. The project combines experiments and process-based modeling, leveraging the Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment (TRACE), a state-of-the-art field warming experiment in the Luquillo Rainforest in Puerto Rico. Comprehensive experiments with soils sampled from control and warmed plots at TRACE inform their biogeochemical response to temperature gradients and changing iron states. A process-based soil model is applied to analyze observations and mechanistically explain the response to changing temperatures.

The project is developing workshop materials for practitioners, as well as novel undergraduate and K12 experiences to link the fields of environmental science and policy.<br/><br/>The project?s overall objective is to build a quantitative meta-model that can predict future states of a scientific model. The project is identifying the parameters, conditions, and processes that how actors and governance structures shape model development. The overall objective is supported by three interconnected activities: (1) systems dynamics modeling, (2) comparative case study, and (3) education, outreach, and engagement that will inform future iterations of the meta-model. The project is solidifying an integrative theory of model governance, comprising both a qualitative framework and quantitative operationalization. Improved computer model governance will transform understanding of science-based environmental policy, including building public trust in computer models and reducing uncertainty that is created by social and political factors embedded in models. The quantitative meta-model will create a key link for modular social-ecological systems modeling: that of how the knowledge embedded in the computer models that organizations use for decision-making is updated in an iterative and adaptive way.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project develops a computational model for turbulent solar convection by advancing the Compressible High-Order Unstructured Spectral difference (CHORUS) code. This interdisciplinary project will support two graduate students including a female Ph.D. student as well as an undergraduate research assistant. The PI will collaborate with NOAA?s Space Weather Prediction Center as well as NCAR?s High Altitude Observatory for broader dissemination of CHORUS++ as open-source code. <br/><br/>This project accelerates the computational efficiency of CHORUS code and improves its accuracy for studying solar convection with an unprecedented capability to capture its hierarchical and inhomogeneous nature, and further exploits the capabilities of CHORUS to shed new light on multi-scale solar convection, and by extension, the fundamental physics of turbulent thermal convection under the influence of density stratification and rotation. The excellent parallel efficiency of CHORUS allows it to achieve the high computational resolution necessary to capture the intensely turbulent nature of the Sun?s convection zone (SCZ). In this project, CHORUS will be improved in three aspects: 1) a boundary- conforming transfinite mapping will be designed to completely remove numerical errors induced by iso-parametric mapping; 2) the order of accuracy in space will be improved from third-order (p2 elements) to sixth-order (p5 elements); and 3) p-refinements and local time stepping capabilities will be equipped for higher resolution in both space and time. The resultant CHORUS++ code will be over 100 times faster than CHORUS. Turbulence in the solar atmosphere is driven by thermal convection which transports heat from the deep solar interior to the surface layers where it is radiated into space. Turbulent convection in turn establishes mean flows and hydrodynamic dynamo action that regulates solar variability. An essential factor in establishing inhomogeneity is the extreme variation in gas density of order 1 million across the convection zone, which produces a commensurate disparity in the dynamical length and time scales. Small thermal plumes driven by radiative cooling in the upper boundary layer merge into larger-scale coherent structures deeper down. This vast dynamical range poses formidable modeling challenges that push the limits of computational fluid dynamics that require local mesh refinements and local time stepping for parallel computations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

EMC talks, a majority of which are given by students, present cutting-edge research in a wide range of fields, including solar energy materials, metamaterials and plasmonics, quantum structures, electrical and optical characterization techniques, wide bandgap and narrow bandgap materials, nanocomposites, 2D materials, and many others. The design, growth and synthesis, development, and characterization of electronic materials are central to a wide range of scientific fields, from quantum sensing, communication, and computation to renewable energy, optical communication and sensing, data storage, power systems, and nano-electronics.  EMC provides a unique opportunity for researchers from academia, government labs, and industry to meet and share the latest cutting-edge results across these broad range of fields.  While currently drawing from a broad range of disciplines and institutions, EMC is looking to broaden participation of scientists and engineers from minority serving institutions (MSIs), including historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).  This proposal aims to broaden participation in the Electronic Materials Conference by forging close, sustainable ties with MSIs, through the NSF Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program, in order to build a more diverse EMC.<br/><br/>The project is designed to broaden participation in EMC by building a sustainable relationship between EMC and PREM, as well as electronic materials research groups at MSIs. The proposed effort will: (i) increase the breadth of research presented at EMC, providing opportunities for dissemination of research results from MSIs at an impactful forum for electronic materials research; (ii) offer opportunities for networking and the building of collaborative research efforts between MSI researchers and EMC attendees, fostering new research efforts and directions; and (iii) strengthen the EMC by broadening participation in the elected EMC organizing committee and pool of invited organizers. The proposed effort will focus on bringing researchers from MSIs into the EMC fold, both as attendees and presenters, but also as invited organizers and members of the organizing committee.  There will also be a focus on reaching out to undergraduate researchers at MSIs, in order to expose these students to a broad range of cutting-edge materials research, inspire these students to continue their education at the graduate level, and thus strengthen the STEM pipeline for under-represented populations.  The program will reimburse EMC registration fees for attendees and participants from MSIs and PREM institutions and will look to support travel and lodging expenses for ?teams? of EMC attendees from these institutions.  Success will be measured by tracking attendance and participation by MSI and PREM attendees, as well as with a post-conference survey to determine adjustments to EMC that will further help to broaden participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bloomington (IUB). NMR is an essential method used by researchers to investigate the structure and motion of a wide range of molecules. Liquid helium is used to maintain superconductivity of magnets essential to NMR spectrometers. As helium slowly evaporates, periodic refills with liquid helium are needed. About 4,200 liters of liquid helium are annually used by the IUB NMR facility. Helium is a precious non-renewable natural resource critical to the aerospace, medical, and scientific research communities.  Current supplies are not sufficient to meet all needs. IUB will build a system to capture helium gas as it evaporates from NMR magnets and then liquefy that helium for reuse. This helium recovery system will reduce the IUB NMR facility?s liquid helium purchases substantially, generating significant helium and cost savings. <br/><br/>The IUB NMR facility provides access to state-of-the-art instrumentation and expertise in solution NMR spectroscopy to more than 160 researchers, supporting research into organic, organometallic, materials, carbohydrate, supramolecular, protein, peptide, and medicinal chemistry while also providing high resolution NMR instrumentation for upper-division laboratory courses for undergraduates. Training the next generation of chemists and biochemists is a core mission of the IUB Chemistry Department. Undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral trainees need access to high resolution NMR spectrometers to learn modern techniques and complete their research.  This helium recovery and liquefaction system will  insulate IU Bloomington researchers from future helium supply shortages and ensures that the NMR facility will remain a viable research resource and a critical asset to the university's teaching mission. Sustainable and affordable research infrastructure significantly will enhance IUB Chemistry?s ability to recruit a diverse cohort of faculty and students for both the research and teaching missions of the department.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is a significant threat to humanity and the natural world. The objective for the Computing for an Equitable Energy Transition (CEET) REU site is to expose undergraduate students to the important and significant role that computing will play in the transition to sustainable energy, both as an increasingly significant energy consumer and in optimizing society?s energy- and carbon-efficiency. The project will emphasize the importance of ensuring an equitable energy transition that does not unfairly impact marginalized groups. CEET's activities will focus on three distinct computing sub-disciplines that are important for enabling an equitable energy transition, including i) designing energy-efficient, reliable, and low-cost sensors, i.e., sensing, ii) designing energy- and carbon-efficient cloud platforms and applications, i.e., computing, and iii) analyzing collected data to identify and exploit opportunities for improving society?s sustainability that are equitable, i.e., analysis. CEET will emphasize the recruitment of groups traditionally under-represented in computing. The intended impact is to train students to work at the intersection of computing, sustainability, and equity.<br/><br/>CEET's scope is broad, as its methods and approaches draw from multiple inter-related sub-disciplines of computing that are critical to achieving an equitable energy transition. Sensing-centric projects will focus on inferring useful information from coarse, indirect, and unreliable sensors that enable environmental monitoring without expensive large-scale sensor deployments. Computing-centric projects will focus on optimizing energy- and carbon-efficiency to reduce the environmental impact of large-scale cloud platforms and applications. Data-centric projects will develop methods for analyzing collected sensor data to automatically identify and exploit real-world opportunities for energy and carbon savings. In each case, projects will consider problems through an equity lens to better understand the reasons and consequences of inefficiency. Ultimately, CEET's goal is to provide students a broad background in the many areas of computing research that intersect the energy transition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inoculation is a long-standing persuasion theory that describes framing and responses to risk issues. Prior research suggests that inoculation messages can confer resistance to persuasion by another competing message. This study expands inoculation theory by testing people?s tendency to approach or avoid competing messages after being inoculated. If an inoculation message makes people more likely to proactively seek out competing information, they might be susceptible to persuasion from competing information compared to other messaging strategies that do not encourage people to explore competing information. This research tests and extends inoculation theory with the goal of helping risk communicators and policymakers to better understand how people process messages characterized by competition and controversy. <br/><br/>In examining inoculation theory, the researchers are studying two issues that are characterized by competition and controversy ? gun violence and nuclear energy. This research (N = 1,500) features a 2 (persuasive strategy ? inoculation vs. one-sided) by 2 (issue direction ? pro or con) by 2 (preexisting attitude direction ? pro or con) between-subject experimental design, plus an offset control condition. It tests how people who read an inoculation message differ from other people in their selective exposure to counter messages or attack messages and subsequent persuasive outcomes. It further explores how these effects may differ among people whose initial attitudinal position is either consistent or inconsistent with the inoculation message advocated position. This research offers risk communicators theory-informed guidance on how to better employ an inoculation strategy to communicate with audiences in today?s high-choice media environment. Findings also shed light on the effects of risk messages among members of the public who hold a wide range of preexisting issue positions for controversial risk issues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will develop a new instrument to measure quantities such as root length and growth dynamics. The education plan integrates undergraduate and high school students into the research activities where they will learn a broad set of skills at the interface of engineering, optics, and plant biology. The project will support student career development through international conference participation and individual mentorship. A 3d-printed, low-cost computational microscopy platform built around a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera will be developed as a pedagogical tool to teach optics concepts through microscopy. The project will also support the development of a curriculum of hands-on experiments to accompany the hardware platform and guide students as they explore light-matter interactions and computational microscopy techniques. Annual workshops will be offered at HMC for undergraduate and local high school students to attract students to STEM fields and offer experiential learning opportunities in engineering.<br/><br/>The scientific research goal of the project is to exploit the light-piping property of plant stems and roots to develop the next generation of optical tools to investigate plant roots and their surrounding environments. Roots and their local underground environment play a critical role in plant health and growth. In addition to physically anchoring and stabilizing the plant, the roots provide a pathway to acquire resources from the soil and establish a chemical and biological link between the plant and the below-ground environment. This means that information about the root system is critical for plant biology and agricultural studies both in the laboratory and the field, providing quantitative metrics for monitoring and improving plant growth, productivity, and sustainability. Unfortunately, soil is not transparent at optical wavelengths and stymies direct imaging of the root systems. Current strategies to overcome this challenge include using a transparent growth medium, glass-walled imaging systems called rhizotrons, or alternative imaging methodologies such as X-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography. However, these solutions are expensive and offer the ability to probe only a small fraction of the overall root system. The goal of this project is to develop a minimally-invasive instrument that will inject light into the stem and root system, capturing and analyzing the backscattered light to map out the root structure. The project will explore two main instrument architectures for achieving this goal: time-of-flight detection and low-coherence interferometry. In the development process, the instruments will also be used to explore the optical properties of plant stems and roots. In addition to the publication of results from this project in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific conferences, instructions on how to build and operate the instruments will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although they are intended to provide much needed support in these areas, social robots remain inaccessible to individuals (e.g., healthcare professionals, educators, and service industry workers) who could best use the technology to produce the greatest impact to our society. This is because social robots still require significant technical expertise to be deployed and there is currently no clear pathway for laypeople to utilize social robots for their desired applications. This research will bridge the gap between social robots and individuals with no robotics/programming experience so that social robots can be made accessible to everyone. This will be accomplished by developing approaches and technologies that empower laypeople to teach and customize social robots for their desired applications, thereby transforming our emerging healthcare and education workforce by increasing their capacity for delivering services previously not possible. Project outcomes will also broadly impact education by supporting interdisciplinary workforce development and broadening participation in STEM for individuals from diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>To address these goals, this project will investigate fundamental approaches and techniques that enable a layperson to teach a social robot via demonstration. Teaching is often an iterative process that requires a teacher and learner to coordinate their efforts towards the mutual goal of knowledge transfer but there currently is minimal effort in engaging a layperson during the robot teaching process beyond providing data or examples the robot can learn from. This research will keep teachers-in-the-loop throughout the entire robot learning process by: 1) developing interfaces that enable a teacher to prepare high-quality demonstrations, 2) developing approaches that improve a teacher's understanding of models learned by a robot, and 3) developing approaches that enable teachers to integrate domain knowledge while they teach a robot. Project outcomes will both advance knowledge on enabling laypeople to independently teach a social robot and our fundamental understanding on how humans transfer social knowledge to machines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, small perturbations invisible to humans can be purposely added to inputs to cause NNs to make incorrect predictions. What is more, attackers can even customize different perturbation strategies to bypass existing NNs' learning methods and defenses. Thus, one open question is how to make NNs more robust to multiple types of such adversarial perturbations. Humans have a highly evolved immune system that can defend against multiple threats, even those never encountered before. Inspired by the powerful immune system, this project aims to infuse key immune system principles into NNs to improve their general robustness, that is, their capability to defend against multiple types of perturbations. The research outcomes will benefit fields that demand robust NNs, such as public health and autonomous driving. Furthermore, this project is planned to support cross-disciplinary education and research projects (involving machine learning and biology) for both undergraduate and graduate students, with outreach activities to high schools and particularly students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>To reduce the substantial gap between existing machine-centric robust learning frameworks and robust immune models, this project focuses on incorporating into neural network design three robust immune-system components to help neural networks defend themselves against various attacks and continuously harden themselves. The proposed research consists of three aims. The first aim is to develop an immune-inspired population-point hybrid optimization that can effectively search for robust solutions and maintain the searching efficiency via a self-adversarial mode connectivity strategy. The developed technique will improve existing point-based learning approaches, which easily become trapped in bad local minima. The second aim considers neural network learning from a robust immune consensus perspective that incorporates stochasticity into learning, allowing NNs to capture global feature information. The third aim expands the first two aims by allowing NNs to adapt to unforeseen types of adversarial attacks with an immune-system-inspired lifelong learning regime consisting of a warm start defense strategy and knowledge distillation-based memory model update. This research effort will enable a new understanding of and a design framework for robust machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is controlled by complex neural circuits that are interconnected through long cable-like structures called axons. One important group of axons arises from serotonin-producing brain cells, which integrate with circuits throughout the nervous system to modulate behaviors such as mood, sleep, appetite, and cognition. Ultimately, these behavioral outputs are determined by the precise growth and wiring of axons. Recent work by the PI and others in the field has shown that serotonin-producing brain cells use serotonin itself to help shape its axons during early stages of development. This research will utilize cutting-edge genetic tools available in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, to understand how this molecular mechanism works inside the cells, how it shapes circuits in the brain, and how it impacts behavioral output. The fruit fly nervous system is built with the same basic components, which assemble and direct neural activities as they do in the human nervous system. The knowledge gained will therefore provide insight into how abnormal serotonin exposure during development can lead to behavioral disorders in humans. These studies will provide students with multidisciplinary research experiences in genetics, cellular biology, and neuroscience through paid research positions. By reducing financial barriers to undergraduate research at an institute serving large populations of low-income and first-generation college students, this project advances the NSF mission to grow a diverse STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Preliminary in vitro experiments indicate the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A initiates signaling events that autoregulate serotonergic axon outgrowth. The first objective of this project is to determine the intracellular mechanisms 5-HT1A engages using genetic and pharmacological manipulation of candidate serotonin signaling pathways in primary Drosophila serotonergic neurons paired with morphometric analysis of axon outgrowth and live cell imaging of actin dynamics. The second objective of this project is to determine how autoregulation shapes anatomical circuits using a single serotonergic neuron (SP2-1) as a model. This neuron innervates the larval visual system and can be labeled selectively using existing genetic tools, allowing 3D reconstructions of the SP2-1 neuron under various experimental conditions. A novel anterograde trans-synaptic Brainbow labeling approach will be used to ask how changes in serotonin signaling alter connectivity of the SP2-1 neuron. The third objective is to understand how defects in serotonin autoregulation can alter behavioral outputs by manipulating serotonin signaling and correlating changes in SP2-1 morphology to changes in vision-based behaviors. These studies will provide the first molecular mechanism of serotonin autoregulation and its impact on the morphological and functional development of the serotonergic system. This research pipeline will also serve as a foundation for future research including analysis of different cell types and/or circuits, behavioral paradigms, other signaling molecules, and developmental stages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Can consumers? emotions be manipulated through technological design? Can technologies themselves be biased? Making Friends: The Historical Construction of Emotions in Technology engages these questions by examining the history of robotics engineering. The project shows that emotions inflected decision-making at every stage of robot production: planning, securing funding, object design, marketing, and the end uses of robots. It also reveals that the seemingly subjective and individual emotions of key players in the development of robotics technologies were shaped by long historical processes and social dynamics. These conclusions demonstrate that historical literacy is crucial for designing technologies that better address consumers? needs, for identifying sources of technological bias, and for spotting intentional emotional manipulation embedded in technological design. The results of the study will be summarized in a crossover book for academic and non-academic readers, academic articles and newspaper op-eds, and public talks. Factual findings, data-sets, and theoretical conclusions will be used to develop undergraduate courses and to train graduate students. Project findings will also provide an evidential basis for public discussions of ethics in technology. <br/><br/>Making Friends centers on three research questions: What roles do linguistic, material, and visual environments play in shaping emotional attitudes towards robots? What emotional needs are addressed by technology policies that encourage the development of robotics technologies? And, how do engineers? design choices ?whether conscious or unconscious?shape users? emotional responses to robotic technologies? Combining archival research, oral history, and computational methods, the project shows how engineers brought their own life experiences and associations into the design process, how they capitalized on social dynamics to appeal to funding agencies and policy makers, and how they shaped consumers? experience of robots by physically modifying design to eliminate or to elicit certain emotional triggers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional two-dimensional (2D) materials like graphene are made of atomic layers weakly bound to each other. The materials to be studied here have extra atoms that are covalently bonded to the individual layers, acting like a glue to hold the atomic layers together and change the way they behave. The exotic properties of these 2D magnets make them particularly interesting for fundamental scientific research and practical applications. The ultimate goal is to control their properties through material design, electric fields, and physical strain. This project will help to pave the way for novel memory and logic devices operating at ultrafast speed with low power consumption. Such devices could impact applications such as sensing and quantum information processing. The investigators will strive to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups by mentoring and targeted recruiting. The partnership between the University at Buffalo and Bryn Mawr College will enable the participation of female undergraduate students through summer exchange and research experiences at national facilities.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This research program symbiotically combines the expertise of the investigators to synthesize new self-intercalated covalent 2D magnets and magnet/semiconductor heterostructures, and to explore and tune emergent spin-based topological and magnetotransport phenomena. The project objectives are (1) to grow high-quality, large area covalent 2D magnets and related heterostructures by chemical vapor deposition and dative epitaxy; (2) understand the mechanisms of real space spin textures and momentum space Berry curvature, their correlation with self-intercalated cation concentration, and the effects of their intertwining on electrical carrier transport; and (3) achieve active control of spin-based topological phenomena in real and momentum space by electric gating, strain, and foreign ion intercalation. The rich phases achievable by varying the concentration of self-intercalated cations in these covalent 2D magnets and their interactions with different vdW templates provide broad material design parameter space that could bestow new spin properties unattainable in existing magnetic materials. This project will advance the fundamental understanding of these materials, decipher the effects of intertwined spin structures and Berry curvature on magnetotransport, and expand the library of materials to chemically stable covalent 2D magnets with a high Curie temperature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This methodology will contribute to answering two questions: (1) In what ways is productivity enacted? Agricultural extension science has transformed both what farmers grow and how they grow it, and it aims to keep farming viable by introducing novel crops and tools. What requires further investigation is the active role small farmers have played in successive scientific efforts to craft productive landscapes, and how the promotion of particular crops is enmeshed in the larger project of securing control over challenging terrain, particularly mountain landscapes. (2) What are the effects of agricultural extension on everyday life for farmers?

Research on and incorporating Traditional Ecological Knowledge has become increasingly popular among conservation biologists who collaborate with and work within the traditional homelands of many Indigenous groups. However, these successes have largely occurred without a complete understanding of how these different forms of knowledge can work synergistically. Furthermore, most conservation initiatives are developed by non-Indigenous groups and institutions. This project uses research methods developed by Indigenous scholars to understand how Indigenous institutions develop and implement their own conservation goals and policies.  An equally important outcome will be understanding how conservation policies interface with traditional Indigenous lifeways, specifically those based in animal agriculture.<br/> <br/>To this end, the project will use a combination of interviews and surveys developed in collaboration with Indigenous scholars to gauge how different groups leverage their knowledges and experiences to achieve conservation and agricultural goals. Data collection will focus on Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife and Navajo Nation Department of Agriculture, which are ideal institutions for modeling how this kind of knowledge exchange and translation occurs. These institutions have more than 100 years of combined experience using both traditional Navajo knowledge and scientific knowledge to develop and achieve conservation and management outcomes that are important to the members of the Nation. Responses will be analyzed by appealing explicitly to categories and types of knowledge that are exclusive to Navajo worldviews. By modeling the synergies of scientific and Indigenous knowledge through perspectives specific to individual Indigenous groups, future collaborations in these areas will be more equitable, just, and preserve the autonomy and agency of Indigenous groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These mandates include assessing regulatory actions in terms of environmental justice, prompting experts to invite historically disadvantaged groups to participate in modeling environmental scenarios. Modeling practices are thus mediating whether and how environmental justice concerns are represented and enacted in environmental governance programs. However, social scientific research demonstrates that such mediation practices can obscure, rather than reveal, social and cultural differences, undermining the potential for transformative change. There is thus a need to evaluate whether and how model-mediated participation can lead to the robust implementation of state-driven, justice-oriented environmental governance programs. This project evaluates the case of California?s model-driven decarbonization plan. It examines why technocrats use environmental modeling tools for mediation and attends to how participating marginalized groups assert their desires for better political representation and social recognition. This project will contribute to the public understanding of technoscientific modes of environmental governance, shedding light on how community and activist participation can reshape the tools of the state.

Blue light is employed to activate so-called 'electron-donor-acceptor complexes' enabling them to either mediate the assembly of carbon-carbon bonds or else to break carbon-oxygen bonds. Processes belonging to the first class are useful for the generation of pharmaceutical agents, agrochemicals, and other societally important products, and the approach being pursued may provide an alternative to current technologies reliant on the use of rare and/or toxic metal species. The second type of processes will be deployed to break down biomass-derived molecules, such as lignin, to turn what are typically regarded as agricultural waste streams into renewable and valuable sources of carbon, thereby potentially reducing dependence on fossil-based carbon sources. The broader impacts of the award extend to the benefits accrued to society as Dr.  Laulh and his team of coworkers pursue a range of activities, including the provision of stimulating and educational research experiences, to better prepare undergraduate students for careers in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce.

The research being pursued under this project will address this problem by utilizing aryl radical species capable of effecting hydrogen-atom transfer that are released upon visible light-mediated excitation of electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complexes of readily generated carbanions (e.g., aminoacetate enolates) and haloarenes. A major goal of the research is to apply this principle to access non-canonical amino acid derivatives via site-selective direct C-H functionalization and to render such transformations diastereoselective by manipulation of the transition state for the radical-radical coupling step using specific counter ions and/or the use of chiral organocatalysts. The second part of the funded project will exploit EDA complexes of solvent anions (e.g., dimsyl anion) and arene-containing ethers to promote selective C?O bond cleavages upon irradiation with visible light. In this case, it is expected that tuning of the electronic parameters between electron-donors and electron-acceptors will enable selective debenzylation of complex protected alcohols and depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass. A number of significant (and heavy metal-free) new methods for both the functionalization of C?H bonds and the cleavage of C?O bonds, are likely emerge from this research program and the pursuit of the aims described will further fundamental knowledge of EDA complex photochemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project can alter the playing field between attackers and defenders, by expanding the defense toolset beyond attack prevention to include post-attack analysis.<br/><br/>The project will consider three main avenues of attacks on DNNs.  The first focuses on analyzing training time poisoning attacks, using clustering and machine unlearning-inspired methods to identify poisoned samples and developing model training methods that trace training provenance to support later forensics. The second focuses on inference time attacks while models are in use, through developing variations of target models that include additional data; the additional data is chosen to maintain accuracy while allowing defenders to make inferences about the models being used to generate attacks. The third focuses on identifying new vulnerabilities arising from neural synthesis models used to generate images, text, and other content, characterizing the space of possible goals attackers might have and methods they might use to poison these models. The project team will also work with industry partners to ground the work and increase the chance of it transferring into real systems, as well as with their department's efforts to increase the number and diversity of people doing research around cybersecurity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such data represents many unique perspectives originating from people from many different walks of life and belonging to different social groups. Accessing such data is relatively easy; however, extracting important and meaningful information to get a holistic view from such an overwhelming volume of unstructured, noisy, and redundant data remains extremely challenging. Automatic text summarization models are important computational tools that enable identification of salient pieces of text by condensing several documents into a short, concise summary, with most algorithms focusing on improving the quality of the summaries along dimensions of fluency, factuality, coherence and so on. However, when it comes to summarizing socially diverse data, an important yet overlooked dimension of quality is the breadth of diverse perspectives that a summary encapsulates. This research aims to improve text summarization algorithms for socially rich data and is specifically motivated by applications in natural language processing.<br/><br/>This project will leverage social diversity, a unique characteristic of social data, for improving the overall quality of multi-document summaries. The technical aims of the project are divided into two thrusts. The first thrust develops a suite of novel datasets of summaries corresponding to multiple documents from different socially salient groups that can serve as reliable benchmarks for model training and evaluation. The second thrust develops new unsupervised and few-shot learning algorithms for generating high quality extractive and abstractive summaries reflecting a broad spectrum of diverse perspectives. This thrust will develop new methods for integrating diversity constraints into summarization algorithms as well as jointly optimizing summary?s textual quality and social diversity. The novel methods will be complemented by a comprehensive evaluation plan including several summarization metrics of automatic and human evaluation. This research effort will create cross-disciplinary opportunities for bringing together researchers and students from language technology and fairness communities to develop new datasets and algorithms for generating socially diverse summaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graph structures often contain rich information and are large in scale. An important task is to synthesize new graphs that are similar to but different from existing ones. For example, a drug design task may require a model to generate new molecule graphs for screening; and a data-sharing task for a social network may need a model to synthesize and share a graph similar to the original network, without releasing sensitive link information. This project combines neural networks and probabilistic methods to develop tools for generating new graphs for a wide range of tasks.

Second, the project will overcome efficiency issues in model training and model predictions. Third, the project will compare newly developed models with traditional random graph models to deepen the understanding of network data.

The overarching theme of the research projects are nanomaterials growth, innovation, fabrication, and characterization. The projects are designed and chosen to build a sense of community among the students and the participating faculty and to expose the REU students broadly to research at the cutting edge of nanoscale science and engineering. The students are offered training opportunities in the integration of research with education and outreach through the Vanderbilt Summer Academy for high school students. Additionally, to facilitate the continued mentoring of the REU students after the research experience is completed and enhance the probability of the students continuing in STEM research, 'home mentors' are invited to visit Vanderbilt to participate in the capstone events and VINSE REU alumni will be invited to meet and talk with the students about their experiences and how this led to their careers in STEM fields. Historical data shows that students have a heightened desire for graduate studies, with 97% remaining in STEM and 72% entering graduate school at institutions beyond their undergraduate institution, ensuring students obtain the richest experience. Long term, the REU site contributes to building a workforce educated in and motivated towards STEM disciplines and specifically, interdisciplinary research in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The program places strong emphasis on recruiting students from underrepresented minority groups and schools with limited research opportunities; the REU program and the VINSE faculty have collaborators at several institutions, including nearby HBCU Fisk University that are committed to helping us identify potential REU students. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: <br/><br/>The promise of nanoscience and nanotechnology to revolutionize our lives in multiple ways has captured the imagination of scientists, the attention of the media, and the general public. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulate matter systematically and precisely at the nanoscale, creating uniquely functional materials that can be inorganic, organic or biological, or a hybrid of any two or more of these. Thus, nanoscience and nanotechnology pose formidable challenges that cut across traditionally distinct disciplines; to meet these challenges, interdisciplinary training of future scientists and engineers in the broad field of nanotechnology is of paramount importance. This is especially pertinent in light of the recent passage of the CHIPS and Science Act. To achieve this goal the VINSE summer REU site offers STEM undergraduates the opportunity to work closely with faculty on state-of-the-art research projects in the field of nanoscale science and engineering. VINSE faculty provide REU students with a true interdisciplinary research experience in an environment where physicists, chemists, biologists, and engineers of all disciplines collaboratively solve problems and create new scientific understanding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each year, a diverse group of students including women and underrepresented minorities in the STEM fields are targeted for recruiting by using the resources of the UA minority recruitment program and a network of faculty and alumni contacts at HBCU and institutions with significant Native American and Hispanic populations as well as students who may have not performed well in courses but show indication of originality and creativity. The selected students participate in experimental and theoretical research projects in nanoscale materials, condensed matter, soft matter, biophysics, photonics, lasers, and nonlinear and quantum optics. They acquire skills and practices essential to scientific problem solving by working in a collaborative environment through mentoring by experienced faculty, post-doctoral scholars, and senior graduate students. They visit high-tech industries, participate in professional development activities that include weekly seminars, workshops on laboratory safety, library database searches, graduate school applications, oral and written communications skills, a participatory scientific ethics course, and social/cultural activities with other REU groups. The program evaluation process uses both direct measures of student success and indirect measures (student, mentor, alumni surveys, publications, presentations) of learning and achievements to provide guidance to continually improve the REU program and broaden its impact. Many participants in the REU site continue with graduate studies or find employment directly after graduation in a STEM fields.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Each REU participant works on a carefully selected research project from topics of current interest such as properties of nanoscale materials, atomically thin material quantum devices, solid-state nanopore fabrication for detection of DNA, novel properties of two-dimensional atomic materials beyond graphene, structured light beams, quantum correlations in  nonlinear and quantum optics, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, and statistical and nonlinear physics of extremophiles and the brain. Through engagement with their research projects for ten weeks, the participants receive technical training in using the state-of-the art instruments, and computational and analytical research techniques. Some students work on stand-alone short term research projects while others help solve a small piece of a large ongoing research project. They all contribute significantly by building a device for data acquisition, writing software for data analysis, calibrating an instrument, carrying out a proof-of-principle experiment or an experiment verifying a theoretical prediction. They experience the creative process involved in scientific research starting from the formulation of a problem to its solution, the ups and downs, and the eventual thrill of a discovery. They participate in group seminars, reviews of research, planning, and discussions, and through this interaction develop a professional network of faculty and peers. At the end of the summer, students present their research at a REU research symposium and submit a final report in the format of a Physical Review paper. Many go on to present the results of their research at national/international scientific research conferences and publish papers based on their work in scientific research journals. Each REU participant leaves having acquired scientific and technical skills for advanced scientific research and softer skills to be a productive and thoughtful member of the nation?s scientific and technical workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rapid growth in demand for 3D models, however, has outpaced our ability to construct them. Employing current modeling tools to perform even the most basic of 3D operations, such as selecting a region on a shape, requires years of extensive training and experience. This project will develop new and accessible tools and techniques for creating and manipulating 3D objects, eliminating existing technical barriers of entry and thereby democratizing 3D content creation. Project outcomes will have broad impact by making 3D modeling more accessible, empowering both expert and lay users to create and transform objects for applications across a wide range of industries and professions.<br/> <br/>The project is centered around the development of 3DStylus, a suite of foundational tools that will enable users to edit and modify existing 3D shapes and create new ones from scratch, using simple text as input. 3D Stylus will encompass three central components: (i) 3D Editor, which will enhance existing 3D models by incorporating text-specified textures, materials, and localized modifications that preserve the underlying shape; (ii) 3D Morpher, which will transform existing 3D models into new text-specified geometry, while preserving the original texture details; and (iii) 3D Creator, which will allow users to intuitively create novel 3D geometries, and make desired edits and manipulations, using only a text description. The research will leverage deep learning techniques which have been used so successfully in 2D (as evidenced by the revolutionary impact of DALL-E), but which have generally been out-of-reach in 3D given the relatively small amount of available high-quality 3D data.  The novel approaches envisioned will instead use the abundantly available 2D datasets as a signal for editing 3D objects. Thus, the transformational potential of deep learning can be harnessed to achieve advanced 3D modeling capabilities, without the need for large 3D datasets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team utilizes experimental and computational approaches to predict, manufacture and test new ultrathin optical nanostructures which will be arranged in configurations that are expected to support next generation optical communications and sensing technologies. Thereby the study closes a gap in the manipulation of light by using specific geometrical arrangements of nanostructures. By that, the research benefits the economy and society of the United States.

However, current nanophotonic metamaterial designs that exhibit chiral light-matter interactions have an extremely weak and narrowband nature, are difficult to control and enhance, usually operate at infrared frequencies, and cannot be made tunable. In this project, the research team tackles these problems by designing new dielectric compact subwavelength helical metamaterials to strongly enhance and tune their chiroptical response at record-breaking levels and at the entire visible spectrum. The proposed new artificially engineered dielectric nanomaterials are expected to unlock novel ways for the efficient and coherent manipulation of the broadband chirality, spin angular momentum of photons, and transverse photon spin of incident electromagnetic waves. The new approach is anticipated to lead to directional spin-polarized radiation and unperturbed chiral edge modes along interfaces with different handedness. Low-loss all-dielectric helical metamaterials are investigated both theoretically and experimentally and applied to different exciting new applications, such as in the design of new chiral nanowaveguides and nanocavities. The structurally induced strong chiroptical response of the dielectric nanohelices is tuned to different frequencies at the visible by varying their geometry. The fundamental understanding and experimental realization of the proposed new nanomaterials is expected to be transformative to the emerging field of chiral quantum optics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the REU/RET site is to train the next generation of science and engineering professionals while increasing participation of traditionally under-represented groups. The MRSEC REU program expands its extensive network of four-year colleges, Tribal Colleges and Native American Serving Nontribal Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and Community Colleges to provide high-quality research experiences in MS&E, primarily to students from undergraduate institutions with limited research opportunities, and to high school teachers from the Twin Cities.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/><br/>The REU Site brings 10 talented undergraduates from a nationwide pool of applicants to the UMN campus for an intensive 10-week research experience that includes extensive training and development of career-building skills.  The UMN MRSEC REU Site enhances the overall awareness and self-expectation of the participants, while increasing their knowledge and appreciation of Materials Science and Engineering (MS&E). This is particularly important for undergraduates from two-year and four-year colleges and minority serving institutions (MSIs), who do not have extensive research experience, and who have little or no exposure to MS&E.  The UMN MRSEC comprises two Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs) addressing pressing problems over a wide range of hard to soft materials: IRG-1, Ionic Control of Materials and IRG-2, Mesoscale Network Materials.  Each IRG integrates the six basic elements of materials science and engineering ? synthesis, theory, structural characterization, property evaluation, processing, and applications ? required for effective innovation in materials research and development. MRSEC faculty and students are based in five different science and engineering departments, assuring a particularly broad and interdisciplinary experience for all participants.  The research advisors represent an appealing blend of junior, senior, and mid-career faculty; all are acknowledged leaders in their fields and have proven records of mentoring undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Machine learning has been deployed in many critical domains such as drug discovery, financial planning, autonomous driving, and malware detection. This makes it crucial for ML-based software solutions to function properly even when attacked by malicious actors, leading to a line of research focused on functional vulnerabilities, attacks that attempt to make ML systems produce incorrect results. Less studied, however, are other kinds of vulnerabilities that don't attack the core prediction functionality but still pose security risks. These ""non-functional"" vulnerabilities include denial of service attacks, which attempt to render the system unusable through overloading it; and side-channel attacks, which analyze features like response time to infer sensitive information about the models or data they are trained on. This project will develop methods for detecting and correcting these kinds of non-functional vulnerabilities and make those methods widely available, as well as disseminate educational materials to help security researchers and ML software developers be more aware of these risks. <br/><br/>Despite a growing number of reported denial-of-service (DoS) and side channel (SC) vulnerabilities in core ML libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow, a systematic approach to identifying and debugging them has not been explored due to multiple technical challenges: i) non-functional behaviors are not explicitly encoded in the syntax or semantics of ML code; ii) existing fault localization methods often fail to establish causal relationships; and iii) automatic DoS/SC mitigation is largely lacking for ML applications. This project will develop a novel methodology that combines evolutionary algorithms with a gradient-based guidance to detect DoS and quantify the strengths of SC vulnerabilities. For debugging, the project explores causally guided statistical methods to localize the root causes and guide an optimal mitigation policy. The project team will make a concerted effort to increase participation of women, Hispanic, and other underrepresented communities via special topic courses, research experiences for undergraduates, and summer camps for K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, label-free and tunable sensors for detecting multiple biomolecules (multiplexed detection) with high sensitivity and short measurement time are still beyond maturity. The goal of this program is to lay the foundations for engineering novel graphene-based biosensors to address these needs with biogenic amine neurotransmitters as testbed. The research component of this CAREER program will significantly advance the field of electrochemical sensing by 1) enhancing our understanding of fundamental questions involving convergence of material-device-readout knobs in design of electrochemical sensors, revealing the effect of interface engineering and electrical gating on tuning sensor response, and elucidating the impact of multimodal sensing and data fusion on enhancing accuracy, specificity, and reliability, and 2) utilizing this knowledge in innovating a new class of reliable, multiplexed, and tunable devices. The research outcomes will provide a foundation for educational activities focused on training graduate and undergraduate students. Multiple initiatives are integrated to increase public engagement in biosensing science and technology, including creating new laboratory modules for a biosensor-themed course, a summer workshop for teachers, and a summer camp for pre-college students.<br/><br/>This program aims at creating tunable and multiplexed electrochemical biosensors with high sensitivity, specificity and rapid response by developing new data-fused hybrid droplet-graphene microdevices. This CAREER program integrates both experimental and modeling investigations which include 1) elucidating the correlation between plasma-assisted functionalization of graphene and analyte-device interface engineering to enhance sensitivity and tune specificity of graphene microdevice array; 2) developing a learning-based multimodal electrochemical system for reliable classification of bioanalytes and multiplexing; 3) understanding the fundamental limits of sensitivity versus response time in a time-evolving system; 4) elucidating the fundamental mechanisms for electrical gating as an in-situ knob to tune the reaction kinetics at the graphene-analyte interface and hence the sensor response; and 5) demonstrating the application of this system with a well-studied drug screening neurosecretion cell model. This project is anticipated to have a long-term impact on biosensor engineering by elucidating how interface and device engineering influence detection limit and response time in time-evolving electrochemical systems and how convergence with multimodal readout can significantly enhance accuracy, specificity, and reliability of label-free diagnostics. In addition, the outcomes will advance utilization of the growing field of 2D material functionalization and devices in diagnostics, bioelectronics, and life science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Locally and regionally, society and infrastructure may be devastated. Globally, such eruptions can affect global climate. Historic examples include Tambora 1815 and Pinatubo 1991. These eruptions occur at subduction zones, where Earth?s tectonic plates converge. They also form calderas, where the ground above the magma chamber collapses to produce a big depression. Such eruptions have occurred at a frequency of several per century, so they are of concern to society. A key question in the efforts to understand the potential threat from such caldera volcanoes is ?how are eruptible bodies of magma assembled and for how long do they persist??. To answer this question, the project will focus on the currently active Cerro Blanco Volcanic Complex (CBVC) in Catamarca, Argentina. Here, three major explosive eruptions in the last ~30,000 years record the episodic development of an active caldera volcano. The project will reveal the growth, development, and persistence of magma at the CBVC using the chemistry and age of minerals that grew in the magma. The latest approaches to age dating and geochemistry of individual minerals from the eruptions will be used. New ways of analyzing and modeling these data will be developed. The project has many broader impacts that benefit the discipline and society. The senior science team is international and diverse. These senior scientists will mentor a junior scientist from Argentina. An undergraduate researcher will also be deeply involved in this project. The outcomes of this project will support the local tourism industry and be the focus of a future field workshop for volcano scientists.<br/><br/>This project will constrain the magmatic processes and fluxes that have assembled and sustained a >30,000-year locus of intense rhyolitic volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes. Two hypotheses relevant to subduction-related caldera volcanoes worldwide will be tested: 1) The magmatic flux that led to the development and evolution of the CBVC is typical of arc-related magmatic fluxes worldwide; and 2) The CBVC is the surface expression of an episodically built composite arc pluton. The first phase of the project will utilize coupled U-series and U-Th/He in zircon (Zircon Double Dating or ZDD) to refine the eruptive frequency and tempo of the CBVC and delineate the spatiotemporal development of the CBVC. This framework will then be used to probe the magmatic evolution, development, and current state of the magmatic complex, directly testing the two hypotheses. To do this, trace elements and O-isotopes in zircon will also be collected and integrated with melt chemistry, rhyolite-MELTS, and thermochemical modeling of zircon ages. The outcomes of the study will include new efforts in thermochemical modeling of these systems that will advance the understanding of how magma is stored pre-eruption in the shallow crust and builds up to catastrophic eruptions of a scale that have occurred in historic times and are therefore of immediate social relevance. This knowledge is also fundamental to how batholiths are constructed, the earth?s crust evolves, and how ore bodies form. The project features international collaborations that provide access to the newest approaches to link age dating and geochemistry of young volcanic systems. A diverse team of senior scientists will mentor an early career researcher from Argentina and undergraduate researchers to ensure that broader impacts of human capital development, knowledge transfer, and research experience for undergraduates are addressed. Outreach to local tourism efforts, and a future field workshop round out the broader impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geotextiles have been widely utilized in infrastructures including roads, railways, and airports to improve soil properties by serving functions of drainage, separation, filtration, and reinforcement. Recently, a wicking geotextile that possesses deep grooved fibers was demonstrated to be able to remove water from soils through evaporation at the edges exposed to air. However, its water removal capability becomes limited either by high humidity or by fine particles in the soil. To overcome these limitations, this project will apply a porous absorbent coating on a wicking geotextile that can generate higher suction of water, and attract, transport, and discharge water laterally to the edges. This project will provide a solution to difficult water-related infrastructure problems that may pose risks to the public and require significant funding for repair and maintenance. <br/><br/>The proposed project will advance the knowledge of water absorption and transport behavior on an absorbent with tailored wettability. Application of an absorbent to a wicking geotextile will enhance its effectiveness in removing water from soils with fine particles. The technical hurdles to be addressed include: effectiveness and durability of the porous absorbent, application of the coating on geotextiles, interfacial behavior between absorbent and soil, survivability of the absorbent coating during geotextile installation in soil, and lateral water transport and discharge in/from the geotextile buried in soils. The specific research objectives are to: (1) manufacture an absorbent-coated geotextile; (2) evaluate the water drainage performance of the geotextile in soils; (3) gain insights into the controlling factors for the effectiveness of the geotextile in soils through numerical modeling; and (4) develop design methods to account for the benefits of the geotextile in roads. The results and insights obtained from the proposed work will serve as a cornerstone for geosynthetic applications that will enhance the water removal from soils by incorporating an absorbent with tailored solid-liquid interfacial wettability. The research outcomes will also allow for rational design of geotextile surfaces enabling absorbing and transporting water even in unsaturated soils.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prior to undergoing rapid intensification, which is defined as a quick or sudden increase in the strength of the storm, hurricanes develop from weaker tropical cyclones that initially are more susceptible to detrimental influences from the surrounding environment. A significant environmental influence is vertical wind shear, which is a change in the direction or strength of the wind with increasing height, and can negatively impact the development of hurricanes. Vertical wind shear can cause a displacement of the mid?upper level storm circulation from the low-level circulation. This misalignment of centers allows more unfavorable, dry air in the surrounding environment to enter a storm?s inner core, a deterrent to further intensification. Therefore, previous work strongly supports the notion that a key step for tropical cyclone intensification is achieving an alignment of centers throughout the depth of the atmosphere. However, it is still not well understood how or why some initially misaligned storms transition toward a more vertically-aligned state and rapidly intensify. In some recent, notable U.S. landfalling hurricanes, uncertainty over the processes associated with this structural transition has caused considerable forecast challenges, particularly with intensity change. This project will use a comprehensive radar dataset to provide insights on the processes associated with the alignment of centers prior to and during rapid intensification.<br/><br/>Previous observational case studies and idealized modeling simulations have identified multiple pathways through which a misaligned tropical cyclone vortex can transition toward an aligned state. However, it is widely believed that convectively-driven diabatic processes are important in the alignment process, regardless of the pathway. Because all tropical cyclones feature convection to some degree, it is unclear how precisely precipitation structures associated with vortex alignment events differ from storms that remain misaligned. This uncertainty is a key motivator for this study. Furthermore, because these different alignment pathways have only been documented either in idealized modeling systems or in observational case studies of individual storms, robust conclusions as to how precipitation, particularly in weak tropical cyclones, interacts with the surrounding environment and affects the vortex alignment pathway in nature remains ambiguous. Therefore, this project aims to build on previous work by contextualizing the vortex, precipitation, and environmental characteristics associated with a given alignment pathway. The overall goal of this research is to investigate weak tropical cyclones using a novel airborne and ground-based Doppler radar database, which provides the most comprehensive observational database of tropical cyclone structure to date. This assessment of precipitation structure at high resolution will help reveal the three-dimensional structure, from which the physical processes responsible for vortex alignment can be determined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research indicates that when teachers and students have similar demographics, students' test scores, attendance, and suspension rates are positively affected. Marginalized social groups consistently bear differential impacts, and all fields of science and mathematics are called upon for commitments to improve STEM knowledge and to create solutions for equitable advancement of K-12 students with STEM literacies. To foster these improvements, a focus of the project will be to provide teacher preparation for undergraduate STEM majors or STEM degree holders to become educators with strong content knowledge and pedagogical expertise that target social and environmental justice initiatives. Teacher preparation and induction will emphasize empowerment, transformative leadership, equitable and inclusive educational practices, and research-informed instruction through planned curricular and induction-period activities, as well as participation in a professional learning community. This will enable high-need schools in California's Central Valley and other areas nationwide to provide their students a strong and inclusive science and mathematics education. This, in turn, will help prepare many of these same students for the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This project at California State University-Stanislaus (CSU-Stanislaus), an Hispanic serving institution (HSI), includes partnerships with Turlock Unified School District (USD), Stockton USD, and Modesto City Schools. The project will be guided by several goals. First, over five years, the project will recruit and prepare a diverse set of twenty-five (25) high-quality students, who are undergraduate majors or who have a degree, in biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geoscience, mathematics, or physics, to become K-12 STEM teachers in high-needs schools. A special focus will be on recruiting students of color and other minorities who are traditionally underrepresented in the STEM arena. The Scholars, who would be supported for up to three years if a current undergraduate student, and for one credentialing year if already holding a STEM degree, would represent an increase of twenty-five STEM teachers beyond current numbers. Second, project activities and CSU-Stanislaus curricula will provide these prospective STEM teachers with high-level STEM content knowledge and culturally sustaining pedagogies as well as leadership, socio-emotional learning, and active learning skills and expertise to prepare them for their future classrooms in high-needs schools. This process will also feature preparation with respect to national narratives, frameworks, and standards concerning teaching and student learning. A third goal is to decrease teacher burnout and attrition rates by creating an induction process that includes a professional learning community and networking opportunities aimed at connecting practicing STEM teachers with one another. A fourth goal is to create, implement, study, sustain, and disseminate a model that (1) involves research-based best practices to prepare and retain prospective STEM teachers, especially from traditionally marginalized groups, and (2) emphasizes pedagogies that attend to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Comprehensive mixed-methods project evaluation will provide formative and summative assessment and feedback. Through publications, conferences presentations, and workshops, investigators will proactively disseminate project findings and outcomes to other CSU campuses and nationwide. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-needs school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These beetles are unique in that they also harbor fungi that act as their food source which grows on the tree tissues. Some of these fungi can then infect the tree and in several cases can result in the death of host trees within months of infection. These beetles and their pathogenic fungi occur worldwide and pose a significant threat to forestry and natural ecosystems. However, no genetic models for the study of any ambrosia beetle-fungal partner pairings are available. This proposal will use the Xyloborus beetle-laurel wilt pathogenic fungus (Harringtonia lauricola) as a model. Both the original beetle and the fungus are invasive to the United States and are rapidly spreading throughout the Southeastern part of the country. The beetle carries the fungus to trees, where the fungus is capable of killing otherwise healthy trees. There are over 500 different species of trees that the beetle uses as a host including swampbay, redbay, sassafras, and the agriculturally important crop of avocado, where the only treatment is to cut and burn the trees. In this project, we will study the dynamics and genetics of how the beetle harbors its fungal partner, including how the beetle chooses, promotes the growth of, and carries the fungus from host tree to host tree. These data can provide foundational information that can ultimately be used to help stop the spread of these tree pathogens. In addition, the project will provide opportunities for training and outreach to high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students on fungal biology, disease, symbioses and evolutionary processes. In partnership with programs at University of Florida, the investigator will develop educational material for the high school teachers and the general public on fungal-insect symbioses.  <br/><br/>Insect-fungal mutualisms are widespread in nature and ambrosia beetle-fungal interactions represent some of the oldest and most successful symbioses known. The fungus serves as the sole source of nutrition for the beetles that burrow into trees to form galleries where they grow and ?farm? the fungus for food. These beetles have evolved specialized structures (mycangia) that house, transport and disseminate the fungus. These fungi and beetles have co-adapted to symbiotic lifestyles throughout evolutionary history and include independent evolutions of different types of mycangia that house different fungal symbionts. The fungus, Harringtonia lauricola is a highly destructive tree pathogen affecting avocado and other members of the Lauraceae family and has killed >300 million trees in the US alone. H. lauricola is the mutualistic partner to its original invasive (to the US) beetle carrier (Xyleborus glabratus) and may have now spread to indigenous beetle species. We will investigate the developmental and genetic mechanisms which underlie the relationship between H. lauricola and Xyleborus beetles. The project will use cellular and genetic approaches to test specific hypotheses concerning symbiotic association. We will: (1) probe the cellular dynamics of mycangial colonization, including investigating selection, persistence/maintenance, turnover, and competition in the mycangia using microbiological and cellular (e.g., microscopic) methods, (2) identify genetic mechanisms that mediate fungal symbioses, e.g., what fungal genes/network are important for colonization and fitness within the mycangia, and (3) construct gene expression profiles (i.e., transcriptomics) of the fungus during mycangial colonization to help define the evolutionary processes that has led to fungal-mycangial symbioses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An improved understanding of Southern Ocean clouds relies on better measurements of aerosols, which are small particles that cloud droplets and ice crystals form on.  This project will deploy a suite of instrumentation on a series of research vessel cruises conducted by Australian collaborators, and at a location in Antarctica, to measure these aerosols.  The impact of the project will be to improve representation of aerosol-cloud interactions and cloud-climate feedbacks over the Southern Ocean, with a view towards improved climate projections.  There is a significant outreach component to the work, where the researchers will interact with K-12 classrooms globally through on-line and in person activities.  The project also represents strong international collaboration.<br/><br/>The research team will conduct an observational and modeling study of the role of natural aerosols in modulating the properties of clouds and precipitation in the Southern Ocean region.  The Southern Ocean is one of the least polluted places on Earth and the distance from dust sources means that aerosols are dominated by biogenically derived sulfates, including impacts from marine primary productivity.  The sources and abundances of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) remain poorly quantified over the Southern Ocean and Antarctica.  This project will take advantage of four upcoming voyages on Australian research vessels, and a deployment at Davis Station, Antarctica, to double the volume of existing surface-based measurements to constrain Southern Ocean aerosol and cloud properties.  The research team will contribute to the pre-existing observational campaigns by providing additional radiosonde measurements and collecting aerosol, seawater, sea ice, snow, and soil for offline INP and DNA analyses.  The researchers will then co-develop process-oriented aerosol and cloud model diagnostics for parameterization testing and development in the Community Earth System Model (CESM).  The project will result in the following deliverables:  1) Documentation of the latitudinal gradients in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) over the pristine oceans during three seasons derived from ship-based sources, 2) Quantification of the susceptibility of Nd to sources of aerosol types and processes to provide important constraints on the observed Nd, and 3) Documentation of latitudinal and season variability in INPs and precipitation occurrence and phase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project analyses universalist accounts of cattle-led environmental degradation by highlighting how different actors?scientific experts and lay breeders, dairy farmers and milk traders, colonial bureaucrats and postcolonial politicians - conceptualized and connected dairy development with economic and political projects in colonial and post-colonial contexts between 1880-1970. These years constituted the peak of the British colonial military?s experiments with organizing the milk supply, and they also mark the beginning of the world?s largest dairy development program. By investigating knowledge production about cattle, fodder, and milk, this project asks three broad questions: 1) what values, politics and concerns drove scientific experiments and public anxiety with purity, productivity, and the health of milk and the livestock 2) what role did the politics of race and caste play in the material organization of dairy infrastructures? and finally, 3) how did dairy development projects affect the cattle, cattle herders and pastoralists, and urban and rural environments?<br/><br/>This project applies historical and qualitative methods to archival material. Sources include popular and scientific journals and outlets that focused on animal husbandry, dairying, and agriculture as well as archival sources that focus on policies related to dairying and dairy development in the twentieth century.

Leading companies such as Walmart are embracing event streaming and cloud-centric web applications to rapidly reshape their business models. However, unexpected performance variances in these web-facing applications could significantly and adversely affect consumers and, ultimately, online businesses. The project addresses this challenge with an experimental infrastructure and research aimed at relieving potential performance concerns from service providers to achieve good performance and high resource efficiency for web-facing applications.<br/><br/>Consistent low latency has become essential for user-facing, latency-sensitive web applications such as e-commerce and real-time stream processing due to its business impact. For example, the Bing search engine team reported that a 500-millisecond delay could lead to a decrease in revenue by 1.2%. Despite continuous efforts made by practitioners, the latency long-tail problem still consistently occurs, where a small number of requests take a long response time (e.g., multiple seconds) to return. Existing (and state-of-the-art) infrastructures mainly focus on the correlation between execution time variance localized in the critical paths (i.e., the longest path in time for a request from start to finish) and latency long-tail in web-facing applications. However, our preliminary experimental results suggest that asynchronous, very short but intense resource demands (milliseconds level, referred to as the ?millibottlenecks?) outside of critical paths can also cause signi?cant latency long-tail, causing serious end-user dissatisfaction and leading to significant revenues loss. This project targets the unique challenges of millibottlenecks outside of critical paths by designing a fine-grained monitoring toolkit and developing sophisticated quantitative analyses for millibottlenecks as well as effective cures for latency long-tail problems to achieve the goals of reducing latency long-tail in emerging real-time processing applications.<br/><br/>This project responds to this research challenge with an experimental infrastructure, to reduce latency long-tail caused by millibottlenecks in real-time stream processing. The project will proceed along with three tasks. First, the experimental infrastructure starts with the initial results of the observed latency long-tail in emerging real-time stream processing through ?ne-grained performance monitoring (e.g., both system- and application-level metrics). Second, the team will propose to methodically evaluate and validate millibottlenecks (including that outside of the critical path) and to determine their causal relationship to the latency long-tail. Third, effective cures will be proposed to reduce latency long-tail by disrupting the causality from millibottlenecks to the latency long-tail problem with negligible overhead. Furthermore, the knowledge gained on the latency long-tail problem caused by various millibottlenecks will enable more reliable performance studies and long-term advances in the design and implementation of mission-critical web applications in clouds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both areas address critical national security issues. The cybersecurity job market is currently experiencing a shortage of qualified personal, especially in the fields of cryptography and coding theory, which require significant technical training. Meanwhile, cryptography and coding theory are also active areas of research at the interface of computer science, mathematics, and physics. The breadth of skills required to perform successful independent research on these topics makes some of the most promising research angles very challenging to approach for new graduate students. For each of three summers, this REU Site offers 10 undergraduate students the opportunity to perform research for 10 weeks in cryptography and coding theory under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary team of senior personal with expertise in mathematics, quantum computing, applied cryptography and hardware security.  Additionally, this REU aims to mitigate the gender gap and the diversity gap in cybersecurity by focusing its recruitment effort on women and under-represented communities. <br/> <br/>This REU Site focuses on some of the most active and interdisciplinary areas of research in cryptography and coding theory. In particular, students are given the opportunity to explore different angles of post-quantum cryptography, which consists in the design of cryptosystems that will resist attacks from future quantum computers. Research projects available to the students include the design and analysis of cryptosystems based on Euclidean lattices, on error-correcting codes, as well as the technical aspects pertaining to their practical deployment. Students are also given the opportunity to explore the mathematical aspects of block cipher design through projects on Almost Perfect non-Linear (APN) functions, as well as the design of error correcting codes that optimize the redundancy effort to mitigate the impact of the unavailability of servers. This REU Site also offers participants opportunities for personal development such as training in cryptography and coding theory by an interdisciplinary team of senior personnel, and professional workshops on intellectual property and graduate school applications.

Despite increasing computing power over the years, fundamental numerical challenges still await solutions.  This project addresses two such challenges: (A) Simulating vortex-dominated fluids; (B) Solving partial differential equations on infinite domains.  These computational problems frequently occur when one computes physical systems in large environments.  The research aims to exploit geometry to tackle these problems at a fundamental level.  A mathematical focus on geometry affords nuanced formulations for fluid dynamics systems that can be more resilient to numerical error.  It also offers systematic approaches for identifying the invariants under transformation.  Project outcomes are expected to simulate turbulent flows at microscopic scales and remove infinite-domain challenges through suitable transformations, while bringing mathematical ideas in geometry to a larger audience.  A diversity-supporting education and outreach plan will likely result in closer communication between different fluid dynamics communities such as computer graphics and the climate sciences.<br/><br/>Many physical simulations take place in a flat Euclidean space.  Therefore, a deeper set of geometric tools, usually motivated by non-Euclidean geometry, has yet to draw much attention in developing numerical solvers.  This project explores geometric ideas expected to solve fundamental challenges in simulation.  One challenge is to simulate fluids at a high Reynolds number, which is central to computer animation, aerodynamics, climate science, etc.  The dominating phenomena are intricate vortex dynamics and turbulence often lost during simulation.  One thrust of the project aims to develop an implicit flow representation that faithfully encodes the vorticity, in contrast to the traditional formulation using a velocity field.  Such an implicit representation can resolve Kolmogorov microscales at low cost.  The other thrust, an Erlangen program for simulation, explores transformations of the domains and the variables such that a partial differential equation (PDE) is left invariant.  When a transformation can turn an infinite domain into a finite domain, finite-domain PDE solvers are automatically infinite-domain PDE solvers after being wrapped by the transformation.  This method would fundamentally solve numerical challenges involving infinite domains.  Preliminary results suggest that many important PDE systems, including wave equations, signed distance fields, optimal transport problems, and minimal surface problems admit such a hidden symmetry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meanwhile, solid-state batteries, which employ nonflammable solid electrolytes to replace the flammable liquid ones, offer a revolutionary solution to mitigate fire hazards that have hobbled the advances of battery technology. One of the major challenges in the development of high-performance solid-state sodium batteries lies in the large interfacial resistance between the sodium ceramic solid electrolyte and the electrode material. This CAREER award project, jointly supported by the Ceramics program in the Division of Materials Research, and the the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), addresses the critical interfacial challenges facing between a sodium metal electrode and the sodium ceramic solid electrolyte through regulating the electrolyte surface properties. The PI and her research group seek fundamental understanding on the interfacial structure-composition-property relationship of the sodium ceramic solid electrolyte. The advancement of scientific knowledge enabled by this research will stimulate the development of solid-state sodium batteries with superior thermal and chemical stability. Such batteries can serve as new alterative low-cost power sources for diverse energy storage applications. Through this project the PI will promote engagement between local elementary, middle and high school students, undergraduate and graduate students in scientific discourse, particularly in the field of energy materials. The PI will integrate this research into high school AP curriculum and will develop a battery-themed summer workshop to get hands-on experience for science and engineering projects. The scientific and educational merits of this project will advance the frontiers of energy storage technologies and promote science and engineering research.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Among the known solid electrolytes for sodium battery systems, sodium-ion superionic conductor, namely NASICON, is one of the most promising sodium-ion conducting ceramic solid electrolytes owing to its high sodium-ion conductivity and excellent electrochemical and thermal stabilities. Meanwhile, sodium metal is considered as the ?holy grail? anode material for sodium batteries because of its low electrochemical potential and high theoretical specific capacity. However, the pairing of NASICON electrolyte with metallic sodium anode for solid-state sodium batteries gives large NASICON/sodium interfacial resistance and nonuniform dendritic sodium deposition over electrochemical cycling. In this CAREER project, the interface chemistry of NASICON will be regulated by a variety of ultrathin metal oxide coatings via atomic layer deposition. This research will investigate the hypothesis that the composition, crystallinity, morphology, and microstructure of the oxide coating on NASICON play critical roles in the early-stage electrochemical wettability of sodium metal and the sodium-ion transport across the interface, which affect the interfacial impedance, the sodium nucleation/growth process, and the electrochemical characteristics. This research can take a leap beyond the lithium technology by utilizing the much more sustainable, natural abundant and low-cost sodium resources. The reduced cost of sodium batteries compared to the lithium systems will make them highly desirable for large-scale energy storage application. The PI will integrate this research program into a variety of educational and outreach activities to broadly disseminate the knowledge/research findings, and to promote STEM fields. The education components mainly include the following aspects: (1) incorporating this research into teaching by developing new course curriculums and research projects for undergraduate and graduate students; (2) integrating this research into local high school AP curriculum; (3) developing summer workshop ?Battery Wonderland? for elementary and middle school students to get hands-on experience for science and engineering projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project combines archival and ethnographic research in order to answer the following research questions: What articulations of racial and environmental justice emerge from people?s different modes of relation to Hevea Brasiliensis from colonialism until present day? What socio-environmental considerations underpin colonial and postcolonial science? How are postcolonial power hierarchies, such as indigeneity, citizenship and class, re-negotiated through the cultivation of rubber by different social groups? <br/><br/>Undertaking a qualitative analysis, this study explores the ways in which colonial officials, smallholders, biotechnology scientists, indigenous communities and artists in colonial and postcolonial contexts have cultivated Hevea Brasiliensis in different ways and with different socio-environmental implications. The project critically analyses how cultivating rubber through science, ancestral knowledge and aesthetics can enable the articulation of multiple forms of social and environmental justice from within monocrop plantations. Moreover, given the growing challenges posed by the interdependencies between climate variability and industrial agriculture, it also speaks to questions of environmental sustainability and social justice. Findings from this project will provide insights and recommendations for governmental and nongovernmental actors interested in aspects of environmental and social sustainability in the context of industrial agriculture. Also, findings will benefit scholars and the public through the dissemination of publications and pedagogical materials through free-of-charge online platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to understand ""tech-for-good"" as an endeavor by empirically engaging with the ethical imaginaries and practices of the people developing and deploying such technologies in the context of transnational migration. In the wake of scandals and lawsuits against big tech companies, there is a broad recognition that high tech does not necessarily equal progress and positive change thus it is imperative to understand alternative technical imaginaries and ethical practices explored in this study. This project's results will provide valuable insights into different technical imaginaries for future technologists. Data will be made publicly available through the Platform for Experimental and Collaborative Ethnography, an online data-sharing platform.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project focuses on the following research questions: What different ethical imaginaries undergird ""tech-for-good"" initiatives in the context of migration and displacement? How are ethical relations practiced by different actors in the development, launch, rollout, and continued deployment of ""tech-for-good"" initiatives? The researchers will address these questions by analyzing the media and promotional materials, as well as the digital artifacts themselves, alongside an ethnography that observes the practices as well as interviews that probe the ethical imaginaries that underlie actors? ""tech-for-good"" initiatives. By attending to such initiatives in precarious and transnational spaces (rather than Silicon Valley companies or similarly elite tech spaces), the project will explore different ways ""tech-for-good"" practitioners develop and critically evaluate technical possibilities and hereby contribute to our understanding of the ethics of technology in practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One exciting promise of MPC is the ability to write such functions as general programs and then evaluate them securely. This would enable even non-crypto-specialists to automatically augment ordinary software with powerful security properties. Tools for achieving this goal have proven elusive, due to barriers to efficiently executing ordinary programs inside MPC. The critical barrier is in efficiently handling random access memory (RAM). RAM is ubiquitous in computing, but efficient MPC handling of RAM is well known as a stubborn challenge.  This project will significantly improve MPC handling of RAM, thus enabling far more efficient general-purpose MPC tools.<br/><br/>Garbled RAM (GRAM) is a powerful MPC primitive that removes interactivity (and hence costly latency) from MPC of programs with RAM accesses.  Recent GRAM techniques overcame several long-standing obstacles to GRAM efficiency and restored hope for significant further improvement. The investigators will seize the opportunity, and will explore and implement novel GRAM techniques. The project?s scope is broad, and includes improving GRAM efficiency, bringing GRAM to richer settings, understanding GRAM?s theoretical and practical limitations, improving the cryptographic assumptions needed to construct efficient GRAM, and implementing software prototypes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archival research of satellite television for distance learning reveals how technological change and usage are intertwined with social and economic geographies in different national contexts. Supposedly obsolete systems like satellite television not only have a significant role to play in some areas but also continues to be adjusted and developed.

Understanding material properties at small length scales is critical for correlating how structural variations influence chemical reactions and specificity as well as energy transfer locally. Dr. Lomsadze and his group are developing a new tool that provides spatially and spectrally resolved chemical and physical information about the two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. Their discoveries could lead to better understanding of the chemical and physical properties of materials on a single particle level, aid efforts to develop quantum devices, and find use outside the laboratory for applications such as chemical sensing or biomedical imaging. Dr. Lomsadze is also developing classroom activities for non-science majors to help students understand and appreciate basic science and technology that is impacting society today.<br/><br/>The Lomsadze lab will combine a near-field optical microscope with frequency comb multidimensional coherent spectroscopy with an eye toward improving the spectral and spatial resolution for super resolution imaging of two dimensional materials in the infrared spectral region. While current methods can successfully evaluate the chemical and physical properties of two dimensional materials routinely, most methods are limited by large signal backgrounds, slow acquisition times, spatial resolution, or spectral resolution. The Lomsadze group is developing methods that have the potential to result in two-dimensional coherent spectra per pixel, that are collected in seconds, with high (i.e., tens of nm) spatial resolution, and with comb spectral resolution. These improvements in spatial and spectral resolution could lead to new information about the chemical, physical, and optical properties of materials with implications in many fields ranging from forensics to biomedical imaging and field analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Movement impairments following a stroke are a major cause of adult disability in this country. The routine treatment is not yet optimal for every individual due to a lack of sufficient understanding of brain functional changes to inform clinical practice. This project seeks to combine different imaging methods to guide electrical stimulation to the brain that improves the recovery of movement. The outcomes of this project have the potential to advance stroke or brain injury research broadly to help over half a million people who undergo rehabilitation each year. This will reduce the healthcare and nursing costs for long-term disability caused by stroke and other similar brain injuries. Through education activities in this project, a multi-disciplinary research-education ?eco-system? will be built to connect engineering students, clinician trainees, and STEM educators to promote the education of next-generation rehabilitation pioneers.<br/> <br/>Despite numerous efforts to develop new technologies for movement rehabilitation post-brain injuries, from brain imaging to neuromodulation approaches, optimal recovery is still limited due to a lack of imaging guidance and real-time neurofeedback to tailor rehabilitation strategies for each individual. This project will address this limitation and establish a unique rehabilitation engineering research paradigm based on a novel multi-modal brain imaging approach and a closed-loop high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) platform. This new approach will precisely assess the changes to motor control in an injured brain and identify the key network to target for more precise HD-tDCS stimulation. The investigator will take integrated experimental and computational approaches to: 1) Identify and characterize individualized brain networks for movement control in injured brains; 2) Model and evaluate the dynamic effect of HD-tDCS on a ?live? brain to enable targeted, precision stimulation of brain networks; and 3) Develop closed-loop imaging and neurofeedback guided HD-tDCS to improve brain function and behavior outcomes. This interdisciplinary project will be integrated with education and outreach activities to promote awareness of interdependencies between engineering and rehabilitation sciences and promote interdisciplinary education and training for next-generation rehabilitation engineers, with three educational objectives: 1) Promote the engagement of engineering and physical therapy students via summer research training, 2) Translate rehabilitation engineering knowledge to grade-appropriate STEM education via training high school teachers, and 3) Increase public awareness of engineering?s contributions to rehabilitation via museum events.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Less studied, however, are other kinds of vulnerabilities that don?t attack the core prediction functionality but still pose security risks. These ?non-functional? vulnerabilities include denial of service attacks, which attempt to render the system unusable through overloading it; and side-channel attacks, which analyze features like response time to infer sensitive information about the models or data they are trained on. This project will develop methods for detecting and correcting these kinds of non-functional vulnerabilities and make those methods widely available, as well as disseminate educational materials to help security researchers and ML software developers be more aware of these risks. <br/><br/>Despite a growing number of reported denial-of-service (DoS) and side channel (SC) vulnerabilities in core ML libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow, a systematic approach to identifying and debugging them has not been explored due to multiple technical challenges: i) non-functional behaviors are not explicitly encoded in the syntax or semantics of ML code; ii) existing fault localization methods often fail to establish causal relationships; and iii) automatic DoS/SC mitigation is largely lacking for ML applications. This project will develop a novel methodology that combines evolutionary algorithms with a gradient-based guidance to detect DoS and quantify the strengths of SC vulnerabilities. For debugging, the project explores causally guided statistical methods to localize the root causes and guide an optimal mitigation policy.

Numerous news reports, best-selling books, television series, and scientific journal articles have increasingly begun to suggest that plant-based healing from Indigenous and folk practices offers a glimpse of hope for those whose suffering has been unaddressed or neglected by biomedicine. Such portraits often reinforce two conventional historical narratives: first, that these plant-based therapies were heralded as medical miracles from the late 1950s to the late 1960s before several scientific and cultural controversies transformed them into social pariahs, effectively ending scientific studies of psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and ayahuasca; and second, that these Indigenous and folk traditions are static, remaining unchanged over time and space. This doctoral dissertation project, however, shows that these historical narratives are incomplete. By focusing on ayahuasca, a plant-based concoction from the northwestern Amazon, this research offers an important corrective to these historical narratives and joins a growing body of research that emphasizes the dynamic relationship between folk and Indigenous knowledge and biomedicine.<br/><br/>This project reconstructs the relationship between scientists, local knowledge practitioners and healers, and ayahuasca from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth century. Drawing on qualitative data gathered from archival research, oral histories and interviews, museum collections, and published sources, this historical project responds to two main research questions: 1) Why has ayahuasca sustained the attention of generations of multidisciplinary and transnational scientists? Preliminary archival research for this project suggests that scientists leveraged ayahuasca to professionalize their disciplines and develop bioprospecting opportunities with limited success. Folk and Indigenous perspectives are, however, often absent from these sources leading to this project?s second major research question: 2) What were the consequences of ayahuasca research, including humans and non-humans? Findings from this project will contextualize the influence of Indigenous and folk knowledge on modern science as well as the role of non-human actors in knowledge production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manufacturing of complex ceramic components, however, has always been problematic and can be costly and laborious due largely to their unique properties, e.g., high melting points and excessive hardness. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers an alternative to produce parts with complex geometries that are challenging to make using traditional manufacturing processes. While of a great potential, current ceramic AM technologies still have limitations in making complex structures with thick walls (e.g., thicker than 10 mm), because of the use of an organic binder and the difficulty in its complete removal during de-binding. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to investigate and mature a new ceramic powder-bed AM process that is assisted with water-based inks, so to eliminate the need of binder removing, followed by compression and mild heating to achieve particle fusion. If successful, this process will enable complex thick-walled ceramic component manufacture in a commercial scale and help accelerate wider adoption of ceramic AM in many industries, including healthcare, energy and defense. This project will also pique the interest of students at different grades in ceramic AM through ceramic-printing programs, including ?Print-in-the-Dark-Side? for students with vision impairment, ?Ceramic Art 3D Printing? for K-12 students, and cross-discipline ceramic printing initiatives for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This CAREER research aims to understand the processing mechanism of a new ceramic AM in making complex thick-walled ceramic parts through employing a selectively deposited water-based ink, followed by uniaxial compression layer by layer. Once the print is completed, mild heating is applied (50 to 200 Celsius) to the built powder bed, in which upon evaporation of the ink due to heating, particles in the ink-wetted region will be fused together. The project will study ceramic particles made of lithium molybdate, calcium phosphate and barium titanate, and employ instrumented compression tests (up to 100 megapascals), multi-scale experimental characterizations, and pore-scale numerical simulations to elucidate the effects of different processing conditions and material properties on the fusion mechanism and degree of ceramic particles, including the ink chemistry and saturation level, the compression magnitude, duration and cycles, as well as the heating temperature and time. The research findings are expected to uncover the mechanism that governs the neck formation and growth between ceramic particles in the studied ceramic AM process, identify the key factors that determine the particle fusion density and strength, and ultimately, enable making complex thick-walled ceramic components with minimum defects, full density and enhanced properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will also advance STEM education by providing cross-disciplinary, mentored training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and a postdoctoral associate, and by offering science laboratory workshops (for children aged 6-10) and career discussion panels (for high school students).<br/><br/>Skeletal muscle development is driven by both molecular programs and mechanical forces. How mechanical stimuli control transcriptional programs and RNA processing mechanisms is a fundamental question in muscle biology. This project addresses the overarching hypothesis that mechanical forces activate specific pathways that turn on/off certain transcription factors and RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that ultimately control the expression of mechanosensitive genes and splice isoforms in muscle cells. The research will first define in an unbiased manner the signaling pathways that respond to mechanical stretching (Aim 1), then take a candidate approach to elucidate how a mechanosensitive transcription factor regulates gene expression programs (Aim 2), and finally examine how the circuit controlled by  arginine-rich (SR) proteins and the CLK1 kinase senses mechanical forces in muscle cells (Aim 3). The outcomes are expected to advance understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying muscle response to physical forces, with implications for human and non-human health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding what kinds of dynamics can lead to effective decision-making ? and which lead to dysfunctional groups ? is increasingly important as our society faces major, large-scale challenges in the near future. One area that is particularly understudied, but ecologically and evolutionary important, is how groups making decisions about timing, such as when to begin a migration or when to flee from an approaching predator. In this project, a series of laboratory experiments will be conducted to study collective timing decisions in a species of schooling fish by leveraging existing technologies to automatically detect and track moving animals. Guided by predictions from mathematical models, the project will ask how groups respond to a variety of timing stimuli; how leadership emerges within the group; and the rules that the animals follow to reach a consensus. The project will provide valuable training and mentorship for one Ph.D. student and three undergraduate students within a transdisciplinary research lab situated in one of the most diverse universities in the U.S. The results of the project will provide important information about how vulnerable social animals may respond to predicted effects of climate change and may inform strategies to protect these species. <br/> <br/>Collective decision-making is a ubiquitous strategy that biological systems at all scales exploit to improve their fitness. Most of the research to date has focused on groups deciding amongst options that are simultaneously available in the environment, such as discrete food patches or migration directions. However, equally important to an animal?s fitness are decisions about timing, such as when to initiate a migration or when to begin to flee from an approaching predator. Timing decisions are fundamentally different from spatial decisions; for example, the ?options? (moments in time) present themselves sequentially and cannot be selected once that moment has passed. Because of this and other differences, mathematical models predict markedly different strategies and outcomes compared to spatial decision-making. To build research capacity in the lab, this project will develop two general-purpose tracking kits: one that is simple, fast, and cheap, and which can be further developed into an educational kit for use in undergraduate and high school classes; and one that uses peer-reviewed software packages that allow for markerless tracking of individuals over long time scales. These two kits will be deployed to understand how social animals learn about one or more relevant times; how they respond to uncertainty in the timing of events; how leadership and collective memory forms; and what signaling mechanisms fish use to build consensus about a timing event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An improved understanding of Southern Ocean clouds relies on better measurements of aerosols, which are small particles that cloud droplets and ice crystals form on.  This project will deploy a suite of instrumentation on a series of research vessel cruises conducted by Australian collaborators, and at a location in Antarctica, to measure these aerosols.  The impact of the project will be to improve representation of aerosol-cloud interactions and cloud-climate feedbacks over the Southern Ocean, with a view towards improved climate projections.  There is a significant outreach component to the work, where the researchers will interact with K-12 classrooms globally through on-line and in person activities.  The project also represents strong international collaboration.<br/><br/>The research team will conduct an observational and modeling study of the role of natural aerosols in modulating the properties of clouds and precipitation in the Southern Ocean region.  The Southern Ocean is one of the least polluted places on Earth and the distance from dust sources means that aerosols are dominated by biogenically derived sulfates, including impacts from marine primary productivity.  The sources and abundances of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) remain poorly quantified over the Southern Ocean and Antarctica.  This project will take advantage of four upcoming voyages on Australian research vessels, and a deployment at Davis Station, Antarctica, to double the volume of existing surface-based measurements to constrain Southern Ocean aerosol and cloud properties.  The research team will contribute to the pre-existing observational campaigns by providing additional radiosonde measurements and collecting aerosol, seawater, sea ice, snow, and soil for offline INP and DNA analyses.  The researchers will then co-develop process-oriented aerosol and cloud model diagnostics for parameterization testing and development in the Community Earth System Model (CESM).  The project will result in the following deliverables:  1) Documentation of the latitudinal gradients in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) over the pristine oceans during three seasons derived from ship-based sources, 2) Quantification of the susceptibility of Nd to sources of aerosol types and processes to provide important constraints on the observed Nd, and 3) Documentation of latitudinal and season variability in INPs and precipitation occurrence and phase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By modeling, characterizing, and engineering the novel physics, this research aims to understand the materials properties and achieve their control. These materials can establish a new platform for energy-efficient and high-speed memory and logic devices, and compact and programmable quantum simulators to address the growing information and energy demands. Integrated with the research, the project aims to promote participation in STEM, focusing on undergraduates and K-12 teachers from groups historically underrepresented in STEM and from rural areas in Wisconsin. The PI partners with the Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSEC) education group and Engineering EXPO at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to organize ?2D ferroelectrics for energy-efficient future? education and outreach program including nanomaterials research, STEM education activities development for high school classrooms, and professional development seminars.<br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials are promising quantum material platforms with many important electronic properties, such as magnetism, strong electron correlation, superconductivity, and ferroelectricity. However, the interplay of ferroelectricity and other quantum properties is significantly unexplored because most current 2D quantum materials are nonpolar. Such scarcity hinders many exciting research subjects such as 2D multiferroics, dipolar Hubbard model, reconfigurable charge orderings, and superconducting diode effects. Recent discoveries of ?sliding ferroelectricity? from polar stacking of nonpolar layers indicate it is possible to design ferroelectrics out of the vast majority of 2D materials with parent nonpolar compounds. The ferroelectricity can be switched via interlayer sliding, where the ultralow van der Waals sliding barrier is much smaller than that of any other ferroelectrics. The PI?s approach is to design and assemble various nonpolar 2D magnetic monolayers into polar stacking structures, where spin and charge orderings are hypothesized to be sensitive to ferroelectricity-driven stacking evolution. To fully understand the new quantum orderings and coupling physics, the research team use an in-house multimodal optical, electrical, and magnetic characterization platform to enable simultaneous access to ferroelectricity, magnetism, and electron correlation at various spatial, temporal, and energy scales. Furthermore, the PI will quantify and dynamic control of coupling strength by electrostatic doping and ultrafast light engineering. The research will advance the understanding of many-body interplay in two-dimensional quantum materials and pave the way for device applications using developed polar and Moir 2D magnets in low-power electronics, ultrahigh-speed spintronics, and reconfigurable quantum simulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, solar cells use semiconductors to absorb light and generate electricity.  Scientists and engineers are continuously working to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of solar cells to help decrease global dependence on non-renewable energy sources.  Many promising new semiconductor materials have been proposed based on computations.  Some of the materials that have been predicted to have excellent properties have been, so far, difficult to synthesize under the mild conditions that would make it possible to incorporate them into devices.  This includes a class of materials known as chalcogenide perovskites, and certain other materials which contain mixtures of halide and chalcogenide ions. Through this award, jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) at NSF, Prof. Sidney Creutz is developing new methods to make some of these materials on the nanoscale under relatively mild conditions and is studying their electronic and optical properties to better understand their potential applicability in solar cells and other devices.  Undergraduate and graduate students are trained in materials chemistry and gain exposure to alternative energy concepts, contributing to the development of a green energy workforce.  This includes the development of a materials chemistry bootcamp to introduce new undergraduate students to research in this area.  Additionally, outreach is carried out to high school students in the state of Mississippi to increase awareness about and interest in chemistry and its relationship to energy.   <br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>There is a critical need for the development of new potential photovoltaic materials that may help spur the widespread global adoption of solar energy.  With this CAREER project, Prof. Creutz will develop new synthetic approaches to emerging semiconductor nanomaterials, and to probe the properties of the resulting materials using a range of spectroscopic and chemical approaches. This work focuses on two general classes of materials: chalcogenide perovskites and chalcohalides, including split-anion perovskites. The first major objective is to study in detail the structure and optoelectronic properties (including luminescence and tunable absorbance) of nanocrystals of the chalcogenide perovskite barium zirconium sulfide and the related material barium titanium sulfide.  The second major objective is to extend these synthetic methods to several classes of closely related materials that have been proposed to have promising optoelectronic properties, including alloys, layered phases, rare earth chalcogenide perovskites, and doped materials.  The third major objective is to develop new synthetic approaches to mixed-anion chalcohalide materials, focused on a detailed fundamental understanding of heterovalent anion exchange between chalcogenides and halides. Integrated with these research objectives is an educational program targeted at K-12 students and early undergraduates, focused on increasing interest and achievement in materials science and chemistry, especially related to applications in energy and sustainability, through activities and outreach programs at local high schools and an intensive materials chemistry bootcamp to prepare new undergraduates for research positions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computing educators are obliged to instill in the next generation of scientists and engineers -- today?s undergraduates -- an understanding of principled methods that enhance software system reliability, trustworthiness, and reproducibility.  A typical undergraduate student is not sufficiently exposed to these concerns nor the aforesaid supportive methods, and yet they will be the ones building future intelligent systems. Thus, this REU site will address these issues, as well as emerging dangers such as introducing bias into AI-based applications or leaking personal data demand instruction in ethical considerations of software systems, another aspect of trustworthiness.<br/>                                <br/>Student participants will learn the state-of-the-art methods typically used in trustworthy and reproducible science and engineering.

These activities are deployed on one-of-a-kind, translational research platforms operated by the University of Utah, namely the NSF-funded Cloudlab and the POWDER project.  Additional activities through the university?s Office of Undergraduate Research and the Utah Center for Inclusive Computing allow the researchers to offer workshops on research best practices, ethics, and inclusion.  With a focus on applications that incorporate machine learning, achieve high efficiency, and the systems that support the applications, each undergraduate participant will work with a faculty mentor and their research group to complete a research project, producing both a written research report and a well-packaged artifact that, together, enable another person to understand the research, repeat the experiments, and reproduce the results.  Students are selected to the program with the dual goals of broadening participation in computing and offering research experiences to students with severely limited opportunities at their home institutions.  The program is assessed at the beginning and end, with an evaluation of how students applied their new understandings to their research projects, with follow-ups conducted as students apply to graduate school. The project plans to share these assessments and the curricular material with other institutions to propagate education in trustworthy and reproducible software to galvanize the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This shift has been driven by a high expectation for ?team science,? that scientists in teams will achieve breakthroughs otherwise difficult to attain through individual or additive efforts. Yet, two problems at the foundation of team science call for a thorough investigation lest this high expectation devolves into underdelivered promise. First, the advance of basic, core scientific knowledge on fundamental questions can be stifled or slowed despite the increased use of this knowledge in responding to urgent questions raised by societal needs. For example, the fast and successful development of the COVID-19 vaccine is conditional on decades of basic research on mRNA mechanisms, but it is unclear how a flood of pandemic funding has helped mRNA studies or other research of fundamental importance in biology. The slow development of the knowledge core may restrain the expansion of the research frontier that builds upon it and affect downstream educational initiatives in the long run. Second, the roles and careers of young scientists in the era of team science have become an overlooked topic against the rise of large teams and a temporary scientific workforce. Indeed, while previous studies emphasized the benefits of teams, recent studies have revealed the cost of teams in constraining creative thinking, curtailing due credit, and undermining career progression. Taken together, the increasing dominance of teams in knowledge production presents an urgent need to understand how individual scientists can learn, progress, and effectively innovate in teams.<br/><br/>This project has three primary objectives. First, I propose understanding the evolution of core scientific knowledge over the past century by analyzing the displacement between highly cited papers on the same topic, using newly available datasets of 46 million papers and 7 million syllabi. Second, I will investigate the psychological, communication, and financial conditions of team innovation at the knowledge core, by analyzing the impact of age composition, collaboration distance, and funding support on the innovative performance of 2 million name-disambiguated scientists collaborating across 3,500 cities around the globe. Finally, I will investigate the career outcomes of team members who contributed to core knowledge innovation, focusing on early-career women and researchers from minoritized groups. Using machine learning models, I will identify the distinct roles of authors across 16 million papers and associate these roles with job outcomes revealed by millions of CVs. This research program will contribute to several fields, including the science of science, science communication, and public policy. The produced literature, metrics, databases, and code will benefit practicing scientists, research and funding managers, and policymakers on how to design, support, and evaluate research teams for innovation at the foundations of sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study is using Zooglider, an autonomous ocean sampler equipped with a range of sensors and capitalizing on a unique opportunity to investigate frontal gradients and plankton communities in the western Mediterranean Sea. It is timed to coincide with a rapid crossover phase of a new NASA satellite mission. The combination of satellite and field-collected data will provide high resolution of the bio-physical consequences of oceanic frontal processes. The project incorporates training for graduate and undergraduate students as well as public outreach. Results are broadly communicated by partnering with a major public aquarium that serves 450,000 visitors per year, including by exhibiting novel porcelain ?Zooware? meant to convey the sensory experience of exploring the ocean?s planktonic fauna.<br/><br/>This project focuses on advancing understanding of frontal processes in the western Mediterranean Sea, at a ?crossover? site where NASA?s new Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite is making high-frequency sea surface height measurements using a high-resolution sensor. Measurements from the SWOT satellite are resolving small changes in sea-surface height, making it possible to follow the development and temporal progression of ocean frontal systems. The investigator is assessing the consequences of these frontal systems by testing the hypotheses that 1) zooplankton, marine snow particles, and predators are altered in these ocean frontal regions with a size-dependent or trait-dependent response; 2) particle-grazing zooplankton are more closely associated with layers of marine snow than with layers of living phytoplankton; 3) vertical thin layers of zooplankton are more likely to form in frontal than non-frontal regions; and 4) higher predators such as zooplanktivorous fish and marine mammals are more detectable in frontal regions  The project makes use of an autonomous ocean instrument, the Zooglider. It includes a shadowgraph imaging Zoocam for resolving zooplankton and marine snow; a dual frequency Zonar to resolve mesozooplankton and larger sources of acoustic backscatter; and a sensitive hydrophone for recording ambient sounds, especially from marine mammals and fishes.

This project will focus on the measurement of dissolved gallium, barium, and vanadium to infer several processes such as the distribution of different water types ? like glacial meltwater or warm ocean water ? sediment supply of trace elements, and the effects of biological productivity on metal cycling in this under-sampled region. The project will support an early career investigator and an undergraduate student researcher and results will be shared with the public through several planned outreach activities.<br/><br/>Utilizing filtered seawater and sea ice samples, this study will use isotope-dilution and ICP-MS methodology to determine concentrations of dissolved gallium, barium, and vanadium. Leveraging distributions of dissolved gallium, barium, and vanadium in their relative ratios with other parameters of interest (e.g., iron and aluminum) this study will investigate: (1) how sea ice processes intersect with water column trace element cycling through material supply, uptake, and remineralization; (2) how local sedimentary processes (reductive versus non-reductive sediments) influence the regional distribution of trace elements; and (3) if a linear-mixing approach, with dissolved gallium in addition to historically used tracers, can be used to constrain circulation of different water types in this region. This study will thus assess the connectivity of Amundsen Sea waters to the off-shelf region, the influence of polynyas on geochemical cycles, and the relative supply of trace elements from terrestrial, cryosphere, sedimentary, and oceanic inputs. These points are particularly pertinent in the Amundsen Sea as a locus of rapid, climate-induced destabilization of the region?s ice sheets and since the Amundsen Sea has connectivity with the Ross Sea, where deep waters are formed, and the circumpolar current, a productive region that influences the chemistry of global water masses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional interests in provision of wood products and clean water have expanded to include climate mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and ecological and social resilience. Forests are complex ecosystems, dominated by long-lived organisms, and are highly connected to adjacent ecosystems at many scales. Long-term research at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest has focused on the ecology and management of hardwood forests, with a focus on understanding the role of disturbance in how forest ecosystems work. The research has continually evolved as unexpected observations emerge from long-term studies, raising questions that can only be addressed with continued long-term research. Recent surprises that will be explored in this latest phase of research are: 1) unexpected changes in the elevational distribution of some tree species that have surprisingly migrated downward instead of up-slope as would be expected in response to warming temperatures; (2) abrupt increases in water use by plants over the past 10 years, and (3) significant declines since the 1970s in some species of birds, salamanders, caterpillars, and beetles. The long-term nature of studies at Hubbard Brook has allowed researchers to build deep relationships with stakeholders. These relationships continue to grow, and researchers will increase participation of new participants to make the site's interaction with the community stronger. <br/><br/>The overarching research theme of this project is the long-term response of ecosystem structure, composition, and function to disturbance. The conceptual model underpinning the project envisions three principal types of disturbance acting as drivers of change in the ecosystem: changing atmospheric chemistry, changing climate, and changing biota. The effects of these drivers play out on a biogeophysical template that includes variation across the landscape in topography, geology, soils, vegetation, and history of past disturbance. Within the ecosystem, the disturbances affect the interacting processes of hydrology, biogeochemistry, vegetation, and food web dynamics. The conceptual model is evolving to focus on ?control points of change? in the landscape - specific places and times where significant changes will begin or accelerate. The research is integrated with broader impacts activities driven by four goals: (1) establish long-term, trusting relationships with community members and environmental decision-makers across the northern forest ecoregion; (2) recruit and train the next generation of ecosystem scientists and environmental leaders; and (3) drive innovations in research, education, and outreach. To achieve these goals, four approaches are planned: public and policy engagement programs, science education and training programs, an art-science program, development and maintenance of infrastructure for interactions with the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cases are emerging where deliberately fabricated disinformation is weaponized to divide people and create detrimental societal effects. Therefore, it is imperative to understand disinformation and systematically investigate how to improve resistance against it, considering the tension between the need for information and security and protection from disinformation.

The Thwaites Glacier system dominates the contribution to sea-level rise from Antarctica. Predicting how this system will evolve in coming decades, and thereby its likely contribution to sea level, requires detailed understanding of how it has responded to changes in climate and oceanographic conditions in the past. This project will provide a record of regional sea-level change by establishing chronologies for raised marine beaches as well as the timing and duration of periods of retreat of Thwaites Glacier during the past 10,000 years by sampling and dating bedrock presently covered by Thwaites Glacier via subglacial drilling. Together with climatic and oceanographic conditions from other records, these will provide boundary conditions for past-to-present model simulations as well as those used to predict future glacier changes under a range of climate scenarios. Specifically, the project will test the hypothesis--implied by existing geological evidence from the region--that present rapid retreat of the Thwaites Glacier system is reversible. <br/><br/>The team aims to utilize two approaches: 1. To reconstruct relative sea level during the Holocene, it will map and date raised marine and shoreline deposits throughout Pine Island Bay. Chronological constraints on sea-level change will be provided by radiocarbon dating of organic material in landforms and sediments that are genetically related to past sea level, such as shell fragments, bones of marine fauna, and penguin guano. 2. To obtain geological evidence for past episodes of grounding-line retreat, the team will apply cosmogenic-nuclide exposure-dating of subglacial bedrock. Using drill systems recently developed for subglacial bedrock recovery, the team will obtain subglacial bedrock from sites where ice thickness is dynamically linked to grounding-line position in the Thwaites system (specifically in the Hudson Mountains, and near Mount Murphy). Observation of significant cosmogenic-nuclide concentrations--the team will primarily measure Beryllium-10 and in situ Carbon-14--in these samples would provide direct, unambiguous evidence for past episodes of thinning linked to grounding-line retreat as well as constraints on their timing and duration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many scientists study the movement, diet, and ecology of today?s sharks, but how does this compare to ancient sharks? Fortunately, shark teeth are one of the most abundant fossils and biological details are encoded within their chemistry and shape. This project seeks to bridge our understanding of modern and ancient shark ecology using techniques from geochemistry, paleontology, and modeling. This project focuses on the Eocene Epoch (56 - 34My) with its warm temperatures and high carbon dioxide levels, which is often invoked as a deep-time analogue for future climate change. Some shark samples will be collected by undergraduate students from the University of California, Merced during a hands-on course at Field School based in Miami, Florida. These students will also learn laboratory skills and build a research community with the Summer Undergraduate Research Institute. This interdisciplinary approach will also be part of ?Shark Survivor!? a one-week summer workshop of middle school students as part of CalTeach?s Bobcat STEM Academy.<br/><br/>This proposal seeks to delve into shark macroecology and bridge concepts between modern and ancient marine ecosystems by integrating geochemical and modeling approaches within paleobiology. The regions of interest are the Arctic Ocean/North Sea, Antarctic Southern Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico; these regions have multiple Eocene localities and together span a latitudinal range, which allows for ecological comparisons across environmental gradients. Objectives for this project include: 1) a comparison of temperature and salinity gradients within a region using stable isotope analysis and global climate outputs; 2) advancement of zinc and enameloid bound nitrogen isotopes as trophic level indicators for fossil sharks; 3) exploration of marine food web structure while considering demography dynamics and community diversity.

Understanding which lightning strikes are capable of igniting wildfires is critical as in the Western U.S. lightning-initiated wildfires are responsible for over 70% of the area burned in these environmental catastrophes. Globally, wildfires are responsible for 6.45 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions annually (18% of total emissions). Detecting high risk lightning strikes (those capable of igniting wildfires) may also significantly reduce losses of life, wildlife, habitats, property, and forests as currently lightning-initiated wildfires in the US devastate 4-6 million acres per year. The reduction of wildfires can reduce large evacuations and smoke-related health conditions, thereby improving the health and welfare of the American public. Both people and businesses would benefit from lower insurance rates due to the decreased risk of wildfire damage. Large wildfires are a constant concern to more than half of the mission assurance priority military installations due to routine testing and training activities that are significant ignition sources.

LCCs are those that last for 40 ms or longer and are essentially responsible for excessive heating. The transformative aspect of this research lies in the ground-based characterization of Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) lightning emissions to identify LCC strikes, with a 95% target detection efficiency and with 40 m accuracy. While for most lightning strikes the current ceases to flow after tens of microseconds, a small portion of lightning strikes (less than 10%) contain a continuing current that lasts thousands of times longer, from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. This can be viewed as a quasi-stationary arc between the cloud charge source and the ground and is detectable through electrostatic field changes and ELF emissions.  A secondary innovative feature lies in the use of machine learning algorithms to pinpoint high risk lightning ignitions by analyzing the environmental conditions at the LCC strike location. This technology can identify a fire in seconds, unlike the present heat or smoke identification systems that can take hours or days to identify a fire.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computer simulations to predict the position and shape of the moving plume of fluid are challenging because the fluid inside the fractures moves faster than the fluid outside. The fracture properties that control this behavior change with the fluid pressure and mechanical stress in the aquifer. In groundwater systems, the viscosity and density of the contaminant fluid often differ from that of the water saturating the aquifer, which causes the fluid to channel through the aquifer in the form of fingers. Although these fingering processes are known, the effects of their interaction on the spreading and mixing of a contaminant plume in a fractured aquifer are unknown. This project will use laboratory experiments and computer simulation modeling to study the interaction between fluid flow, rock deformation, and fracture processes that affect the spreading and dilution of aquifer plumes for radioactive waste disposal and carbon sequestration applications. Increasing our knowledge will lead to better selection of the waste disposal site and minimize errors in the forecast of plume position and plume size at a selected site, and help decrease the aquifer remediation cost and time. The project will generate publicly available datasets and modeling tools which will be shared with groundwater engineers, hydrogeologists, and environmental engineers through an industry-academia partnership. A Masters-to-PhD Bridge program with summer research experience will be created for students.<br/><br/>The spreading and mixing of groundwater solutes in fractured rocks are multiphysics problems in hydrogeology due to the coupling between fluid flow, solute transport, and geomechanical processes. This project will improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms stemming from the two-way coupling between solute transport and geomechanical processes in stress-sensitive aquifers in the presence of fingering and convective mixing. How the coupling activates certain fracture and fingering directions while suppressing others and how the hydromechanical properties affect the spreading and mixing metrics are questions that will be addressed through high-resolution numerical simulations, fracture mechanics and hydrodynamic instability theory, and experiments of solute transport in rocks. A novel spectrofluorimetric tracer quantification method coupled with distributed strain sensing will be developed. Experimental and simulation results will be synthesized to define a transport-geomechanics coupling strength parameter based on the hydromechanical properties of the aquifer and the physical properties of the solute.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While actions of individual components of a system may be difficult to chart (due to chaotic classical motion or inherent quantum uncertainty), the collective behavior of a large number can be easier to predict, for example the dispersion of sound waves despite random movements of gas molecules. This is made possible by the tools of statistical physics that enable systematic averaging over stochastic motions of molecules, to describe effective field theories for evolution of relevant densities. The extensive utility of this approach, averaging from uncertain motions of particles to near deterministic collective behavior, in describing physical systems in equilibrium, suggests its applicability to broader class of entities. Some examples of collective behaviors of complex entities, especially in systems out of equilibrium, are explored in this research. <br/><br/>(i) The emerging field of active matter is concerned with collective motions of entities, such as bacteria, artificial self-powered nanobots, of even flocks of birds or school of fish, that individually consume and dissipate energy. Despite stochasticity at the individual level, interactions lead to fascinating coordinated motions of the collective. We have found that such long-range coordination can be disrupted by obstacles within the medium, or even disorder at its edges. The research team will explore the roles of disorder and boundaries on phases of active matter. Phenomena to be studied include the long-reach of disruptions caused by impurities, and the wanderings of passive bystanders caught in the flow of active matter.<br/><br/>(ii) At a basic level, a key difference between elements of active matter and atoms in ?equilibrium matter,? is that consumption of energy sets up a natural arrow of time. In contrast, one cannot distinguish between movies of equilibrium gas particles running forward or backward. Interestingly, insights gained from behavior of ?active matter? can be explored in other domains of physics, such as in the context of photons and radiation, for example, heat transfer. The team is investigating the feasibility of heat engines based on radiation, with similarity to non-equilibrium forces exerted in active matter through the ratchet effect arising from asymmetric boundaries.<br/><br/>(iii) Living systems, the epitome of non-equilibrium, consume energy not only to move, but to grow and reproduce, presenting other phenomena to explore. For example, as a bacterial film, or a tumor expands into new space, its composition is dominated by successful ancestors at the expansion front. This sets up a connection between the shape of the front, and the competing bacterial variants. The research team will classify possible shapes of films that may appear during growth and expansion of competing variants. <br/><br/>This research activity is closely incorporated in seminars and courses of the PI which through his published textbooks and web-pages reach a broad scientific community. This research crosses disciplinary boundaries and has potential impact in diverse areas from applied mathematics to immunology.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Fluctuations, whether of quantum, thermal, or non-equilibrium origin, are cause or signature of various physical phenomena. Generalizing concepts and mathematical tools characterizing equilibrium fluctuations to the realm of non-equilibrium phenomena has been a long-running endeavor. This research aims at quantifying out of equilibrium fluctuations in diverse contexts. Specific goals include:<br/><br/>(i) The emerging field of active matter is concerned with collective behaviors of entities that consume energy to move. The current of energy through the system yields novel collective phases and fluctuations, not always describable with field theories of equilibrium matter. The research projects will explore the roles of disorder and boundaries (static or mobile) on active matter. Phenomena to be explored include long-ranged correlations and force, and anomalous dynamics of inclusions.<br/><br/>(ii) Quantum electrodynamic phenomena in setups without time reversal symmetry share common features with active matter. In particular, we shall explore the feasibility of a radiative heat engine that utilizes a ratchet effect to generate force, and forces that violate Newton?s third law in setups that break electromagnetic reciprocity.<br/><br/>(iii) Growing populations provide yet another venue for exploration of emergent phenomena. One set of research projects pertain to classifying morphologies of films arising during growth and expansion of competing species. Another set deals with dynamics of populations with time-varying reproduction rate due to mutations or external conditions.<br/><br/>The projects in this research will be studied through a combination of numerical and analytical methods. The typical starting point would be a simplified model of elements following simplified but refine-able rules. On the analytic front, the goal would be to coarse-grain the model to the level of a continuum description, and to then apply methods of field theory to characterize phases and fluctuations. The numerical task would be to implement the simplified rules and characterize the emergent behaviors, in contrast or support to the theory.<br/><br/>Characterizing probability distributions underlying fluctuations in nonequilibrium settings has been a long-standing quest in statistical physics, with notable recent progress on several fronts. Yet, puzzles of force in active matter, and fixation in growing bacterial fronts are but two examples amongst several projects pointing to complexity of the underlying phenomena, which this research aims to unravel.<br/><br/>Education and development of human resources are an essential broader impact: The research activity is closely incorporated in seminars and courses of the PI which through textbooks and web-pages reach a broad scientific community. Past students and postdocs of the group are productive members of academic and research communities. This research crosses disciplinary boundaries and has potential impact in diverse areas from applied mathematics to immunology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators will search for these radio waves and measure their properties. The team will also make computer models to explain the brightness of the radio waves using the magnetic properties of star and planet. This research will train future astronomers and engage undergraduate students in scientific careers. The team will share this research with a broad audience with a planetarium program, available in both English and Spanish. They will also create high-school-level educational materials based on the research results.<br/><br/>This project will examine magnetic star-planet interactions from low-mass stars through interconnected observational and theoretical investigations. The investigators will follow-up newly discovered planetary systems from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. TESS has multiplied the population of known planetary systems predicted to have a detectable signature of radio star-planet interaction. These planets have orbital periods of less than 1 one day, making it feasible to observe complete orbital cycles using ground-based telescopes. Telescopes will be employed to search for periodic radio emission induced by magnetic interactions between low-mass stars and their innermost planets. The team will close knowledge gaps by characterizing the target stars? magnetic fields via Zeeman broadening and improving planetary radii via transit photometry. To interpret the radio observations and better understand the ability of close-in exoplanets to power radio interactions, the investigators will carry out 3D modeling of the circumplanetary magnetic/plasma environment for magnetically active and inactive stellar hosts.

The theoretical underpinning of any computational imaging technique is its model for light propagation. Vision and graphics research generally adopts a geometric optics approximation of light transport, where light travels along straight lines until it undergoes a scattering event or gets absorbed. At small scales, the wave-like properties of light become far more noticeable and require modeling light as a wave at the cost of additional computational overhead. In practice, imaging systems are neither perfectly incoherent (as in geometric optics) nor completely coherent (as in wave optics). Light is more aptly modeled as a state mixture: a statistical ensemble of coherent waves. This project develops a comprehensive theory and corresponding imaging techniques to leverage state mixtures for a wide variety of imaging applications, including the development of new computational microscopes, 3D sensors, and optical vibration sensors. Moreover, this project connects techniques used in both the incoherent and coherent settings, drawing upon imaging research developed across multiple different research communities. In addition, the project will develop a low-cost, open-source projector-camera platform to easily implement a collection of important computational imaging techniques. This platform will be used to educate students at all levels (graduate, undergraduate, and K-12).<br/><br/>This project tackles three independent, but tightly coupled, research thrusts focused on (1) mixed-state sensing, (2) mixed-state illumination, and (3) mixed-state scene analysis. The first thrust explores state mixtures observed at the sensor. Many imaging techniques depend on the incident light being coherent (such as in coherent diffraction imaging), and do not account for the incident light having multiple wavelengths or polarization states. This thrust develops flexible imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms that can uniquely recover complex fields from incoherent mixtures of multiple coherent fields. The second thrust investigates a new form of transport probing based on programming mixed-state illumination. Transport probing provides a camera the ability to enhance or attenuate specific light paths. This thrust develops a fundamentally different approach to probing that involves selectively interfering pairs of light paths, which has applications in 3D sensing and the separation of direct and global light paths. The third thrust uses mixed-state scene analysis techniques to infer scene dynamics, which includes optically amplifying and measuring the imperceptible vibrations of objects. A focus of this thrust is to capture vibration measurements at higher spatial resolutions, in a more light-efficient fashion, and across up to six dimensions of motion, providing more and better information about visual scenes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than a quarter of people living in the United States in 2014 had a disability, and 24.2 million people aged 18 or older required assistance with activities of daily living such as feeding, bathing, transferring, dressing, toileting, and ambulating. Caregiving robots have the potential to help increase or prolong user independence while reducing caregiver burden. However, there are hardly any caregiving robots that provide long-term care for performing activities of daily living, currently. One of the primary reasons is the fundamental limitation to which robots can reason about physical contact which is essential to perform these activities. Therefore, our key insight is to leverage this physical contact instead of avoiding them and to learn safe and efficient physical interactions while empowering the users. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project focuses on learning robot control policies that leverage physical contact during the activities of robot-assisted feeding and bed-bathing while empowering the users themselves with decision-making capabilities for assisting care recipients with Spinal Cord Injury.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop fundamental capabilities towards reshaping the field of robotic physical caregiving by designing control policies that leverage varied multimodal physical interactions to perform activities of daily living (ADL) safely and efficiently. This also entails addressing perception and action uncertainty in unstructured environments by empowering the users to make critical decisions without completely relying on full but fragile autonomy. The fields of assistive robotics and physical human-robot interaction have primarily focused on deliberate contact at the end-effector using carefully controlled actions that are optimized for sensing. This does not capture the realistic scenarios of physical caregiving that may require reasoning about incidental and/or distributed contacts. This project aims to cover this gap and takes the first steps towards translating laboratory research in robotic physical caregiving to real-world deployment. The research plan is organized into three thrusts where the first thrust focuses on designing autonomous control policies that use multimodal sensory inputs for safe and efficient robotic physical caregiving. The second thrust brings users in the loop to augment autonomous control policies and empowers the users by including them in the critical decision-making process. Finally, the third thrust focuses on designing control policies for robotic caregiving that can adapt to a user's changing cognitive workload. This project focuses on the activities of robot-assisted feeding and bed-bathing and aims to evaluate these methods with individuals with C1-C4 Spinal Cord Injury in their real homes towards long-term assistance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These two effects are related, because a warmer ocean can melt sea ice faster, and when sea ice melts, more sunlight gets into the ocean, making it even warmer. Melted sea ice may also result in more ocean turbulence as it allows for bigger waves on the ocean surface. We do not fully understand how melting sea ice and a warming ocean influence each other, and it is difficult to make ocean measurements in the Arctic Ocean. Here we propose to use an existing dataset of turbulence observations to understand whether warming of Arctic waters is associated with ocean mixing, to identify regional patterns in mixing, and to quantify changes in recent years. These observations were made with a highly specialized instrument that can directly measure ocean turbulence, which has been infrequently used in the Arctic Ocean. Part of the proposed work is to develop new methods to interpret the data in this unique environment. Once these methods are developed, they may make long term monitoring of changes in Arctic turbulence possible. The motivation driving this work is to improve understanding of how Arctic climate change will affect interactions between the ocean and sea ice. This is an important goal both for Arctic coastal communities, who face a loss of sea ice and increasing coastal erosion, and for improving predictions of global climate.

Understanding potential feedbacks between sea ice loss and the warming Arctic Ocean is of critical importance to predicting and mitigating future climate change. Here we propose to use an existing dataset of 264 profiles of shipboard turbulence observations collected on two Arctic Observing Network cruises to <br/>assess the strength of vertical mixing in boundary current regions of the Arctic Ocean, and quantify any correlation between the strength of mixing and temperature of boundary currents (which have warmed in recent years); and <br/>identify regional patterns in mixing along the Arctic shelves and quantify any changes in mixing rates relative to prior studies. <br/>We aim to use the results to both improve our understanding of Arctic ocean mixing in a warming climate and inform future efforts to monitor changes in the Arctic mixing environment. These deployments represent some of the first uses of turbulence instruments in the Arctic ocean which can be routinely deployed on hydrography cruises, and processing and interpreting the resulting data will require new methods due to differences between the Arctic ocean and the lower latitude oceans where these instruments are usually deployed. Once completed, this analysis will provide information about changes in Arctic oceanic vertical mixing and how the vertical transport of heat and nutrients will evolve in a changing climate. The underlying objective of this work is to improve understanding of the Arctic climate and its likely trajectory in terms of vertical mixing rates along the margins. This aim is important regionally, as Arctic coastal communities face a loss of sea ice and coastal erosion, and globally for improving predictions of the future climate. Additionally, this proposal is structured to support the early careers of two female scientists, and will also support a collaboration with the Birch Aquarium to develop an exhibit to explain Arctic climate change to a broad audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The newer 2022 list includes 50 critical minerals and the U.S. remains import reliant for most of these commodities. Removing materials from the critical minerals list requires a multi-disciplinary approach that encompasses mineral exploration, material flow analysis, sustainability, mining methods, public policy, mineral economics, extractive metallurgy, and production process. To provide a platform for stakeholders from academia, the private sector, and government agencies that represent these disciplines, Missouri S&T University will convene an in-person workshop on ?Resilient Supply of Critical Minerals? on the university's campus in Rolla, MO, on August 9-10, 2023. Themed topical sessions will discuss the resilient supply of critical minerals from cross-disciplinary, convergent perspectives, including mineral exploration and source diversification, mineral processing and recycling, policy making, and resource sustainability. National leaders in their respective fields will give keynote presentations, followed by TED-style talks, panel discussions, and breakout sessions. The breakout sessions will be structured for interdisciplinary engagement, to provide a convergent perspective that includes economic, technical, social, and policy aspects. Research road maps will examine and evaluate the concept of criticality and recognize the cross-disciplinary nature of techniques required to enhance supply resilience. The workshop findings will be summarized and disseminated in a workshop report. <br/><br/>The in-person format of this workshop will help to develop and nurture personal relationships between participants from academia, government agencies, and the private sector ? thereby facilitating multi-disciplinary collaborations in critical minerals research. Increasing critical mineral supply chain resiliency remains important to the U.S. economy and defense. Existing research has yet to span fully the multi-disciplinary nature of approaches available to enhance supply chain resilience. Geologic, mining engineering, metallurgic, economic, environmental, and social components associated with critical minerals are usually discussed separately with little convergence among the different fields. This in-person workshop will address this gap by providing a platform for engineers, geoscientists, economists, and political scientists from industry, academia, and the government that rarely meet otherwise. The workshop organizers will prepare a comprehensive report that can be used to inform decision-making in pursuit of increasing supply chain resilience, ranging from mineral exploration, separation, and recovery to environmental and social impacts, as well as political processes. The workshop will help nurture an emerging national community with a wide range of expertise in critical mineral supply resilience, spanning academic, industry, and government entities. Travel grants, particularly for students and early-career researchers, will help build a community that spans generations and ensure the meeting's lasting impact. The development of a healthy and active critical mineral community is pivotal to national security and the economy because the U.S. is currently import-reliant for most of the commodities on the critical minerals list. This workshop will develop and publish roadmaps for guiding efforts to gradually decrease import reliance for individual critical minerals, thereby strengthening the economic competitiveness of the U.S. Further, this workshop will generate insights into how U.S. universities can meet the projected future demands for the nation's critical minerals workforce, particularly in rural areas which are most likely to contain undiscovered resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Atmospheric release of carbon has been well-documented for decades; however, water is more difficult to monitor and its role in the Arctic carbon cycle has often been overlooked. This research will explore the environmental drivers that Arctic groundwater and headwater streams play in long-term permafrost carbon release. Better understanding the emerging role that water plays in the carbon cycle in a warming Arctic will help improve regional carbon budgets, quantifying the amount of carbon lost from the land that is exported via rivers in a watershed underlain by permafrost. The research will also aid in monitoring the impacts that climate change and resulting permafrost thaw have on ancient permafrost carbon release by carbon dating the dissolved carbon carried away in rivers to identify ancient permafrost signatures.  <br/><br/>At a long-term experimental study site in interior Alaska, 50% of the soil carbon lost from soils annually was unaccounted for in atmospheric carbon flux measurements. The missing 50% of carbon lost is hypothesized to be exported in dissolved organic carbon fluxes and that an increasing amount of ancient, permafrost carbon is released each year with increasing permafrost thaw. This research will (1) help to resolve the Arctic net ecosystem carbon budget and help to parameterize future Earth System Models; (2) identify the proportion of dissolved organic carbon that is ancient permafrost carbon, using radiocarbon dating; and (3) identify how environmental drivers, such as thaw, impact dissolved organic carbon concentration and age in order to help constrain future predictions of dissolved organic carbon export. Further, the project team will facilitate various outreach activities in Arizona and within the local community surrounding the field site in interior Alaska, to include the broader public as well as a future cohort of young scientists in this work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have proliferated America?s college campuses, with initial creation costs in the thousands to millions of dollars. While emerging data demonstrate the tremendous impact makerspaces may create in the engineering learning experience especially for learning engineering-relevant skills, data also demonstrate that makerspaces fail to meet aspirations of being open and welcoming spaces for all. Currently, it is difficult to determine the learning impact of a makerspace and to compare different makerspaces structures or makerspaces at different institutions with different populations of students. Drawing upon qualitative research that identified the modes and contents of learning in university makerspaces, this project will create and validate an instrument that measures student learning in makerspaces: the Learning through Making survey Instrument. The Learning through Making Instrument will provide a tool for researchers and educators to assess the educational value of makerspaces, compare across different environments, experiment with different approaches, document the learning impacts, and ultimately facilitate understanding how makerspaces can enhance engineering education. This instrument will assist educators in understanding learning gaps that may be associated with obstacles for students providing educators with data critical for designing more makerspaces and associated curriculum that broaden participation and cultivate more accessible and welcoming learning communities. The Learning through Making Instrument will be developed and validated for collegiate students providing a springboard for quantitative research on learning in makerspaces and will facilitate future development of similar instruments applicable for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The research objective is to develop a survey for measuring learning in university makerspaces and similar environments. The proposal team?s prior work, The Learning through Making Typology will be a partial basis for development of the Learning through Making Instrument. Data for instrument development and validations with diverse engineering students will occur at very different universities, including San Jose State, Texas State, Texas A&M, Purdue University, Georgia Tech, and James Madison University.

These universities also provide a contrasting set of makerspaces. An initial pool of items will be generated, experts will evaluate the pool of items, and evidence of reliability along with structural validity will be sought by exploratory factor analysis and then confirmatory factor analysis. Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing indicate that fairness of assessments is just as crucial as validity and reliability, and fairness will be evaluated as a key part of this research. We seek to answer the following Research Questions: To what extent are measurement construct specifications and actual assessment questions aligned? To what extent are there measurement invariances between different groups of students? Are there significant differences in the mean scores between groups that indicate certain groups are learning differently in makerspaces?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One research literature suggests that people's pre-educational intuitions about mechanical physics are largely veridical, another literature suggests that these intuitions are largely incorrect, and yet another suggests that they are incorrect in infancy but become veridical even before significant physics education. These seemingly contradictory findings complicate the development of educational interventions, since interventions suggested by one line of research are contraindicated by others. The overarching goal of this project is to start synthesizing and reconciling these different lines of work. The project is inherently interdisciplinary and will depend on new and emerging methods for robust and reproducible research such as automated online testing, citizen science, and advanced analytics. Such tools are increasingly important in human research but relatively little training in them for students is available. Thus, the educational component of this CAREER project will focus on enhancing such training and includes updating an innovative, interactive textbook on computational modeling and analysis, developing and running an intensive summer training program for citizen science; and providing undergraduates with direct, hands-on education. The project is funded as a CAREER award by the EDU Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literatures on STEM learning, broadening participation, and workforce development. <br/><br/>Multiple research literatures have engaged questions about the nature of intuitive understandings of mechanical physics, but they have often supported discrepant conclusions, thereby making ambiguous what their implications are for the characterization of fundamental cognitive architecture as well as for the design of educational interventions. Moreover, because these conclusions arise from different disciplinary communities studying different populations using different methods, it is not clear whether these discrepancies reflect real differences in how people think about different physical processes in different situations or whether they are simply artifactual. Objective 1 of this project will apply the tools of psychophysics in order to test the reliability of a range of tasks developed in these literatures in an attempt to determine whether differential performance (if any) suggests multiple underlying cognitive systems. Objective 2 will use the tools of developmental psychology to study age-related differences in children on tasks adapted from the range of literatures to see whether the developmental patterns observed by developmental scientists are specific to their methods. Objective 3 will investigate whether the measures developed in these disciplines differentially predict student success in introductory university physics. Thus, the three objectives will systematically assess and compare the stimuli, tasks, and research methods common to the currently-disjoint literatures, allowing for direct comparison and synthesis, with subjects ranging in age from 6 months to adults. All three objectives will involve unusually large and diverse samples --- often by utilizing automated online testing and citizen science -- and advanced analytics. By attempting to reconcile these relatively disjoint literatures, the project will have the potential to contribute to the development of educational interventions in physics at a variety of ages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacteria are ?immunized? during viral infection when a fragment of invader DNA (called a spacer) is captured and used as a sequence-specific immunological memory to recognize and destroy matching sequences. This project will investigate the mechanisms by which diverse CRISPR systems acquire immunological memory, and to discover factors that bacteria use to control this process. The programmable sequence-specific nucleic acid recognition and biochemical activities of CRISPR-Cas nucleases have been exploited for a wide range of biotechnologies. Understanding how these systems are programmed by their natural hosts will better enable researchers to generate diverse CRISPR libraries in vivo, and will benefit CRISPR-based technologies aimed at molecular recording of cellular histories. This education plan of this project is comprised of a course-based research experience in which undergraduate participants will systematically measure interference by diverse CRISPR types targeting different viruses. This course will give students hands-on experience with the concepts of molecular biology and viral infection, and also represents a defined framework for students to rapidly generate and publish novel data.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand how diverse CRISPR types acquire new spacers from foreign genetic elements. Listeria seeligeri and its phages is a tractable model for studying four distinct CRISPR types, including the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 system.

However, the processes underlying the initial spacer acquisition events that establish immunity remain unclear. This proposal will employ next generation sequencing to detect rare acquisition events with high sensitivity. CRISPR-associated genes will be systematically mutagenized to assess their contributions to immunization. The CRISPR-Cas13 system uniquely targets RNA rather than DNA, and the acquired spacers will be examined to understand whether and how this system specifies the capture of transcribed target sequences.

Only 3% of BLV individuals have been employed in a STEM field. The lack of accessible accommodations creates roadblocks for these students in STEM education throughout their academic journey, leading many students to give up, even though they have as much potential for academic success as the general population. All web-based, non-decorative diagrams are required to include alternative (alt) text descriptions for use with screen readers. Current methods for making STEM visualizations accessible through alt text are not scalable or amenable for use with dynamic digital media, nor is alt text standardized or proven usable by learners, resulting in lost learning opportunities for BLV students. The absence of reliable auto alt text generation is a roadblock for educational institutions and academic publishers to adopt new instructional technologies, as digital content and learning systems must include accommodations for accessibility. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will create a first-of-its kind system that generates descriptions of STEM diagrams as the educational resources are constructed.

The technical objectives are to: 1) create a system that produces machine-readable configurations for the components of a diagram and spatial relationships between the components, and then generates a text-based description of the diagram and 2) devise a non-linear method for representing STEM content through a standardized system of representational layers within the description.

Unprecedented policy and funding initiatives at state and federal levels are underway to expand access to preschool. These efforts are driven by considerable evidence that high quality early learning opportunities have far-reaching academic, social, and economic effects. Research has shown early mathematics learning, in particular, to be predictive of later life and learning outcomes. However, classroom studies suggest some children?s early schooling experiences are characterized by exclusion from opportunities to learn, invisibility in the classroom community, and negative relational interactions with peers or teachers (Battey, 2013; Parks, 2020; Shalaby, 2017; Wood et al., 2018). Realizing the potential of preschool expansion demands a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the varied ways opportunities to learn play out for individual children within and across classrooms.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to illuminate the variability in opportunities for mathematics learning in early childhood through capturing the experiences of individual children over time. A qualitative, longitudinal investigation will follow 15 young children (from preschool to kindergarten), from three different school sites across three years of early schooling. The goal is to understand how these children navigate opportunities to participate in mathematical activity, their perspectives of what knowing and doing mathematics entails, and the resources they draw upon to engage in mathematical practices. Data collected will include video recordings of children?s participation in specific instructional activities (e.g., Counting Collections), field notes from classroom observations, artifacts such as mathematical tasks and children?s written representations, and interviews with children and their classroom teachers. Findings from the project will (1) advance the field?s understanding of the nuances of and conditions under which particular approaches to mathematics teaching and learning may (or may not) promote learning, (2) provide insights into relationships between in-the-moment interactions with teachers and peers, and children?s long-term experiences in school, and (3) document young children?s emerging participation in mathematical practices such as communicating about their mathematical ideas, using tools and representations, and engaging with one another?s contributions. The project will provide case studies, depictions of instructional practice, and longitudinal records of learning over time to inform policy and practice in the teaching and learning of early math. Such insights are a critical step if education is to fulfill its promise as a vehicle for the betterment of society.<br/><br/>The award is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These patterns also affect upward motions (upwelling) in the deep branches of the deep-ocean motions. Seamounts can be sites of prominent mixing of waters with distinct buoyancy and of energy dissipation in the global ocean, but recent results suggest that the amount of energy that goes to mixing and dissipation depends heavily on processes that develop at scales between hundreds and thousands of meters (submesoscale instabilities). These processes may be critical in constraining the role of seamounts in ocean energetics and motion. The proposed research will investigate the dynamics of flows past seamounts with high-resolution mathematical simulations, to examine the role seamounts play in the global vertical motions, that is, the overturning circulation. General circulation models currently approximate only a limited subset of these processes and do not correctly represent the effects of the transfer of energy from thousands of meters to meters. This project will investigate the problem in a wide range of realistic configurations to examine how the patterns of mixing and energy dissipation change, depending on environmental and seamount characteristics. This knowledge will inform future approximations that can eventually include these small-scale impacts in global and climate simulations. The numerical tools will be readily available in the open-source community package 'Oceananigans,' which promotes reproducibility of results and provides these tools to other projects and other researchers. The project supports the postdoctoral work of an early career researcher.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Submesoscale instabilities extract energy from the balanced flow field and generate a forward cascade to turbulent mixing. The energy pathways for this forward cascade in turbulent wakes are not currently known, nor is the parameter dependence of the energy flux and the nature of the secondary instabilities that mediate the transition to turbulence. The work proposed here will address three potentially transformative questions: Q1: What processes control the forward energy cascade in submesoscale wakes? Q2: How do submesoscale instabilities impact the integrated (along topography and in the wake) dissipation and mixing for flow encountering seamounts? Q3: How well are the energetics of the submesoscale-mediated energy cascade around seamounts represented in General Circulation Models? These questions will be addressed in an idealized numerical domain with turbulence-resolving nonhydrostatic Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) using Oceananigans, which is an open-source, flexible fluid dynamics solver that uses a finite volume discretization based on that of MITgcm. Two options for LES turbulence closures are available, with which the project PIs will investigate the subgrid-scale model dependence. The LES approach differs from Reynolds-Averaged approaches (RANS - which most other recent work on related topics has used) in that LES allows the relevant scales of the energy to be resolved, including the vital role of centimeter-scale turbulence in the forward energy cascade. A small number of complementary RANS simulations will also be performed to evaluate how accurately turbulence closures represent topographic wake turbulence using the GCM CROCO, which is based on a formulation of the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS). CROCO uses a topography-following sigma- coordinate with a higher order pressure gradient force scheme to minimize errors at steep topographic features and has a variety of available BBL turbulence closures, making it well-suited for investigations of flow-topography interaction problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While any property, in principle, can be computed with the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics, such computations quickly become too complex to be practical. The new method, adaptive force matching (AFM), maps such first principles calculations to simple mathematical expressions and thus allow macroscopic properties of materials to be computed with a tractable computational cost. Specfic systems to be studied by the Wang research team will involve predictions of solubility, of minerology processes under cryogenic conditions, and of properties of microporous crystals.  The research is expected to have long range scientific broader impacts in functional materials, and even potentially drug design and planetary science. Dr. Feng Wang will also train next generation scientists with a collaboration between the departments of chemistry and theatre, where students in chemistry will be mentored by master of fine arts students for engaging presentations of chemistry concepts.  Educational videos will be produced as part of this collaboration.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Feng Wang and his research group are developing methods that will extend the time and length scale of electronic structure calculations to enable predictive simulations of ensemble properties and  of slow dynamics. The adaptive force matching method maps potential energy surfaces of electronic structure methods computed in the condensed phase to simple molecular mechanics energy expressions.  The advantage of this technique is to enable molecular dynamics simulations at larger length and time scales on a potential energy surface that remains accurate to the reference electronic structure. In the proposed work, further development of AFM will incorporate better regularization of parameters through cross validations and Baysesian inference. A new method to treat polarization is also being developed.

Over its five-year duration, the project will provide scholarships to twenty-two (22) aspiring STEM teachers majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, or mathematics with a double major in education. This project at Webster University (WU) includes partnerships with the Ritenour School District, Ritenour High School, and St. Louis Community College (STLCC). To support student professional and educational experiences to lead to well-prepared STEM educators, the project also includes community partnerships with the Academy of Science St. Louis, the Urban League of St. Louis, and the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. A fundamental impetus of the project is to strengthen the pathways and pipelines for the combination of STEM and STEM teacher preparation programs through specialized curricula and specially designed project activities. This will enable high-need schools in the St. Louis area and beyond to provide their students a strong and inclusive STEM education, which, in turn, will help prepare many of these students for success in a future STEM education and the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This project at Webster University in St. Louis will be guided by four main goals. First is to recruit more students beyond current numbers to pursue both a STEM degree and teaching certification through purposeful pathways. The project will follow a ""grow your own"" approach by recruiting prospective teachers and, later, placing them as certified teachers in high-need schools in their home community. Second, project initiatives will strengthen the pathways and pipelines to STEM teaching through specialized curricula, culturally relevant pedagogical methodologies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, enhanced advising, collaborative faculty-student research projects in STEM, field experiences in high-need schools, and STEM outreach programs with community partners. A third goal is to enact collaborative partnerships with academic and community organizations that provide relevant professional and educational experiences leading to better-prepared STEM educators. A fourth goal is to promote success for STEM teachers working in high-need schools through supportive mentorship and intentional induction opportunities to strengthen students? mastery of STEM concepts and skills and improve teacher retention. Qualitative and quantitative project evaluation will provide formative and summative feedback and assessment. Project data collected regarding how demand is met for high-quality STEM teachers in St. Louis will be compared to results in the literature to add to the knowledge base on filling gaps in teacher shortages, especially in urban areas. This project will also add to the ""grow your own"" literature on meeting teacher capacity needs through the three Ps (pathways, pipelines, and partnerships). The project will distinguish itself in that the three Ps leverage not only a high-need school district, but also local community colleges and community partners engaged in STEM activities. Through publications and presentations at several different venues, investigators will proactively disseminate project findings and outcomes to other institutions regionally and nationwide. This Track 1 Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school district.

While the general conditions responsible for the process are understood, recent observations have demonstrated that blowing snow and blizzard conditions can vary significantly in time and space.  Forecasting these events is difficult; weather models do not include the process, meaning that forecasters are reliant on imperfect techniques to predict the hazard.  Further, it is believed that blowing snow can modify the lower atmosphere suggesting that additional downstream errors in forecasts are possible. Besides these immediate impacts on society, blowing snow is a critical process in open, cold regions of the globe by impacting the distribution of water and energy at the Earth?s surface. Innovative observations are needed to better understand blowing snow and provide the ground truth needed to advance efforts to model the process.  <br/><br/>This collaborative project seeks to understand the physical mechanisms and impacts of blowing snow in the Northern Great Plains. The project will investigate the microphysical structure of blowing snow layers and the roles that terrain, atmospheric state, and sublimation have on the evolution of these events. Innovative observations will be made in and around eastern North Dakota/northwestern Minnesota, a region prone to blizzards and blowing snow events. The project will continue development of affordable, ground-based and balloon-borne microphysical imagers. Collectively with traditional radiosondes and vertically pointing lidars, observations will be used to evaluate and improve a fully coupled blowing snow parameterization within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and the improved model will be applied to identify the key aspects determining blowing snow behavior. Multiple graduate students and numerous undergraduate students will be impacted through field work, analysis of data, numerical modeling, and deployment of hydrometeor imagers to other academic institutions.

With the advances in computing resources, sensing capabilities, and wireless technologies, traditional networks in different sectors in smart cities, e.g., energy and transportation, are being evolved into emerging networks to make smart cities a reality. Emerging networks will allow real-time flow of enormous amounts of data, and thus, these networks have the potential to open various vulnerabilities and threats that include unauthorized device/network access, location tracking, false data injection, impersonation, data modification, sensor attacks, jamming, spoofing, etc. Furthermore, although there is a need for a growing, qualified, and dedicated cybersecurity workforce to ensure the secure, privacy-protected, reliable, and effective operation of these emerging networks, higher education is not keeping up with the increasing demand for future cybersecurity workforce.

To give an example in English, speakers sometimes pronounce words ending in -ing with -in? (e.g., working vs. workin?) depending on language-internal factors (e.g., -in? is used more frequently in participles than in nouns like ?morning?) as well as external (e.g., -in? is used more frequently in casual conversational context than formal). To learn such probabilistic patterns is a daunting challenge as children must figure out variants in alternation, factors relevant to the alternation, relative probabilistic rates associated with each variant and more. Accounting for this process is crucial to any account of language acquisition, yet only a handful of studies have directly investigated children?s acquisition of variation. <br/><br/>While emergent evidence suggests that children do acquire variation, we also know they tend to change their language input and make it more regular ? a process often referred to as regularization. Taken together, a paradox arises: children apparently learn and match probabilistic linguistic variation under some circumstances but regularize such variation under others. When would children match variation and when would they regularize? While previous research identified the presence of a conditioning factor, quantity of input and frequency of alternating context as important factors, this question remains largely under-explored. This dissertation investigates the effects of reliability of language input and whether variability is shared across speakers on learners' matching of probabilistic variation. Specifically, child learners are exposed to miniature languages designed to contain variation, and factors are manipulated one at a time to determine whether they provide learners with important cues with respect to whether to regularize or learn the variation. This research contributes to a further understanding of how children balance two important learning mechanisms to find regularity despite noisy signals while preserving meaningful probabilistic aspects of the language, thus yielding insight into cognitive mechanisms underlying language acquisition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tectonic deformation and erosion that shape landscapes cause temperature changes that are recorded in rocks. Ore deposit formation and the creation of hydrocarbon accumulations are in part temperature-driven. Over the past 50 years, geologists have developed ways use radioactive decay products found in minerals to decode temperature histories. While decay products accumulate at a well-known regular rate, they can also be lost from minerals at elevated temperatures. Over the life span of a mineral grain, the net remaining decay product and thus the measured mineral age represents the outcome of these competing processes of steady gain and temperature-dependent loss. Studying different minerals with different responses to temperature can be powerful. Researchers need a broader range of alteration-resistant minerals to use for as wide a range of temperatures as possible. This team will determine whether the common white mica can be used for temperature-history studies. This mineral is easily dated by the potassium-argon method, is resistant to weathering, and shows promise in being able to work over the 300 ?C to 400?C temperature range, an interval not well covered by other minerals.  In addition to presentations and publications, this team will develop outreach videos for students and the general public about mineral dating and how it supports basic research about the Earth.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a new means of determining the temperature histories of crustal rocks across the range 275?C to 425?C. Several published reports suggest that 40Ar/39Ar analyses of the mineral muscovite can address this range. To test how useful muscovite might be as not just a dating target but also as a means to measure temperatures during rock cooling, the researchers will carry out diffusion and dating experiments on a suite of well characterized muscovite samples that have known temperature histories that can be compared to predictions from their experiments. They will also choose samples for reheating experiments designed to examine the response of muscovite samples to shorter timescale, higher-temperature thermal pulses. What makes muscovite a particularly appealing target for study are suggestions that rather than behaving as a simple diffusing system, muscovite grains show multi-diffusion-domain behavior, such that each grain of muscovite is in effect a collection of subsamples having partially overlapping retentivities for argon. If so, an individual sample could record a continuous segment of a thermal history that extends over some 100?C or more. Moreover, it has been proposed that sample-specific information about muscovite diffusion properties can be obtained as a byproduct of 40Ar/39Ar laboratory step heating analysis, which would support the recovery of more accurate thermal histories than would be possible by applying generic kinetic data obtained from a limited number of published diffusion studies. The research will test both the proposal that muscovite analyses can reveal a range of thermal-history information and that these analyses can also yield accurate diffusion-kinetics data. The work involved will form part of a Ph.D. dissertation as well as an undergraduate project. To convey their work broadly, the team will develop instructional materials targeted at the undergraduate level on such geochronology topics as what sort of diverse people can do this kind of work, why they do it, and how. These materials will be integrated with a series of videos prepared in collaboration with animation professionals, and tested in classes before release.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the tectonic history of the region has generally been oversimplified. This research will reveal the crustal type (continental or oceanic) of different tectonic blocks, reconstruct their fit prior to the opening of the northern Atlantic Ocean, and provide a tectonic ?snapshot? for each geologic time period. The results can help pinpoint the timing and extent of critical geological processes that affect paleoclimate, biodiversity, and initiation of oceanic water circulation. The research will be integrated with education efforts, including mini research projects in advanced geophysical classes at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; a summer camp for high school students and underserved students from Girls Inc. of Lincoln and Omaha, NE; and five education modules that will be disseminated to educators across the nation via the Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College.

This project will examine crustal architecture and tectonic structures of individual regions via the integration of geophysical methods with geological constraints from scientific drilling. A set of robust and comprehensive geophysical models in three individual regions of the Northern Atlantic ? the Norwegian-Greenland conjugate margins, the Jan Mayen microcontinent, and the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge region ? will be developed to define subsurface structures that are in agreement with multiple geophysical methods. The identified tectonic features will be traced in-between the modeled lines in all three regions using spatial analysis of potential fields, building a framework for a consequent tectonic restoration, which will provide new fundamental knowledge of the pre-Atlantic continent. Integrated with these efforts, the education goal is to promote geophysics as a career of choice by engaging diverse undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in interactive learning experiences centered around an integrated geophysical approach.

The proposed system will be indexed to the water surface and will adapt to changes in water height but will necessarily be anchored to the bottom.  What is unknown in this project is how rigidly the system has to encounter oncoming waves in order to both survive extreme events and not absorb too much wave energy as to limit water flow.

This data infusion is opening up new opportunities to use data literacy instruction to augment instruction already required for compulsory humanities subjects, such as English language arts. Additionally, the potential for improving students? data literacy through the analysis of textual data is directly relevant to increasing future participation and success in STEM fields and professions. For example, word frequency visualizations and analyses are fundamental text analytics techniques that are at the core of many new language technologies, such as language model-based chatbots, and emerging STEM-related careers, such as data journalism. Text analytics techniques are also changing how language is understood and analyzed by digital humanists, who use such analytics to make patterns and tendencies in language use visible. The next generation workforce needs to be prepared to work with language and text as data. The goal of this project is to develop and research the potential of integrated data literacy and text analytics instruction in middle school English language arts. This integration may make fundamental data literacy practices more accessible for students who are not taking related STEM coursework, provide new resources to help students with reading comprehension, and create new pathways for greater participation in STEM fields and professions.<br/><br/>Through co-design, classroom research, and participatory professional development with practicing English Language Arts teachers, this project will be developing text analytics tools, visualizations, and techniques that are well-suited and tested for use in English Language Arts middle school classrooms. Changes in student understandings related to data literacy and textual literacy as a result of using these new resources will be documented through clinical interviews and analyzed across multiple years of the project. Changes in student awareness and perception of STEM skills and data-intensive careers will also be surveyed and studied across multiple years. In addition to creating new pathways for STEM skill development, a key hypothesis of this project is that the introduction of data literacy activities in English Language Arts can also make text comprehension more accessible for students who are still developing their English language fluency. These data literacy activities provide graphical and visualization resources for recognizing important features of text and language. A majority Hispanic/Latino public school district with almost a third of its student body classified as English Language Learners, is partnering with the university-based research team, will be participating in yearlong teacher professional development activities, and will be providing cycles of feedback and improvement throughout the project.  An estimated 3000 public middle school students will be using innovative data literacy integrations in their English language arts classes. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most work in concert with small molecules that contribute electronic functions or molecular pieces needed for the reaction. These small molecules, referred to as cofactors, often contain one or more metal atoms in their structure. These metals are most often iron, zinc, copper, magnesium, and manganese. An important class of cofactors are called porphyrins. The heme molecule, found in hemoglobin, is a porphyrin that contains an iron atom in its center. This project will involve the production of a cobalt analog of heme. This cobalt-protoporphyrin (CoPPIX) cofactor is expected to drive reactions that have not been previously observed to occur in biological systems.  The project will also support the development of a freshman undergraduate research experience course focused on experimental design and analysis.  The enzymatic breakdown of plastic will be the model system studied in the combined instruction/lab course. <br/> <br/>A grand challenge in biocatalysis is to merge traditional synthetic catalysts with biological scaffolds. The resulting enzymes could hypothetically accomplish highly selective versions of known reactions and even enable new transformations. Swapping the identity of a metal cofactor is a highly productive route to generating new reactivity. However, the process of generating artificial metalloenzymes is laborious. The central goal of this project is to expand the reaction scope of biochemistry using a new, fully genetically encoded metallo-cofactor. This effort will attempt to develop a robust, generalizable route to producing cobalt-substituted porphyrin (CoPPIX) in vivo. Once accomplished, one would explore how the chemistry of this cofactor can be controlled to facilitate new-to-nature hydrogen-atom transfer chemistry. This lab has already shown that E. coli BL21 can be coopted to biosynthesize CoPPIX and insert this cofactor into proteins. Three complementary tasks are proposed: improve CoPPIX production through ferrochetalase engineering, explore the reactivity of a putative cobalt-hydride (Co-H) intermediate, and tune the chemoselectivity of enzymes bearing the CoPPIX cofactor to perform new biocatalytic transformations using directed molecular evolution.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering (CBE) Program in ENG/CBET and by the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) and Chemical Catalysis (CAT) Programs in MPS/CHE.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Arctic sea ice has declined in area over recent decades. Ocean surface waves are becoming more common in the Arctic as sea ice loss exposes the ocean surface directly to wind producing waves. Sea ice floats on the ocean in pieces called floes that flex and fracture under the influence of waves. Although waves traveling into the sea ice lose amplitude, waves propagate deeper into sea ice as floes are fractured into smaller pieces and are more widely spaced. Sea ice that is highly fractured is more prone to side melt, therefore further enabling wave production and propagation, floe fracture, and sea ice retreat. <br/>The intellectual merit of this award is the furthering of wave-ice interaction theory and developments to an Earth system model that simulates sea ice floes, ocean surface waves and their interactions. Observations will inform the model developments. Climate simulations with these model advances will be the first ever to treat sea ice and wave interactions. Previous climate simulations have generally simulated too little Arctic sea ice decline compared to measurements over the last 45 years. Including wave-ice interactions in the model is expected to improve the simulation of the past, produce a better estimate of expected sea ice and climate change over the next century, and yield better forecasts of the sea ice response to storms.<br/>This work has broader impacts due to the importance of understanding past and future climate change. Future projections of Arctic sea ice cover, warming, snowfall, and sea level rise are necessary to inform policy decisions. Simulating Arctic waves in sea ice is also important for warning communities about coastal erosion and hazardous coastal conditions. The project results will be disseminated by publishing in standard scientific journals. The project findings will contribute to the content of courses the science team teaches on global warming, climate and climate change, ice and climate interactions, and climate modeling. The project team will give lectures on research findings to the public, to high-school students, and broadly to other scientists. <br/><br/>2. The decline of Arctic sea ice exposes larger open water areas in the Arctic Basin and subpolar seas, enabling greater production of local wind driven ocean surface waves in the Arctic. In addition, thinner, less concentrated, and more fractured sea ice floes permit waves to propagate deeper into the sea ice pack. Sea ice floe are heavily fractured near the sea ice edge due to wave-induced flexural motion. Floes are also fractured in the interior of the sea ice pack from sea ice deformation driven by wind and current stresses. Heavily fractured sea ice can enhance lateral melt, which further accelerates the rate of sea ice decline. Observations have shown that the width of the wave-induced fracture zone varies by region and seasonal and extends up to a few hundred kilometers into the sea ice. The evolution of the sea ice cover and the near surface heat exchange of atmosphere and ocean depend on the geometric distribution of floes and the open water surrounding them. The distribution of floes has the greatest impact on the sea ice state near the edge, where ocean heat content tends to be greatest. Observations suggest that a single large storm can cause severe floe fracture and mix ocean heat upward into leads, subsequently accelerating the loss of sea ice area. The intellectual merit of this award is the furthering of wave-ice interaction theory and developments to a prognostic floe-size distribution of sea ice in a widely-used sea ice model. Improvements to wave attenuation in sea ice will also be made to a wave model. Objective methods to estimate parameters dynamically while combining models and observations with data assimilation will be employed. Code improvements to the floe-size distribution in sea ice and wave components will be incorporated into the Community Earth System Model, in fully-coupled mode. Simulations with these model advances will be the first ever to quantify the role of dynamical sea ice fracture in the coupled climate system. The new dynamics are expected to increase Arctic climate feedbacks and improve the predictive capability of the model. Increased sea ice feedbacks are expected to strengthen sea ice loss during Arctic storms, where winds are southerly on the eastern flank of storms. The model will permit new fundamental research about how sea ice floes evolve in the climate system.<br/>This work has broader impacts due to the importance of understanding past and future climate change from rising greenhouse gas concentrations and other climate forcings. Future projections of Arctic temperature, precipitation, ice mass balance and sea level rise are necessary to inform policy decisions. Simulating Arctic waves in sea ice is also important for predicting coastal erosion and hazardous coastal conditions.

This type of computer-administered educational test identifies which skills students have successfully learned with a short, yet reliable, test that is individualized for each student. CD-MST with module preassembly allows test developers to review the quality of test forms before test administration and provides detailed diagnostic information about what topics students have mastered alongside an evaluation of their achievements. However, only a few methods have been proposed to preassemble tests in CD-MST. In addition, there are unique challenges when using CD-MSTs when other constraints need to be met, such as ensuring that the test provides an even balance of all content areas covered by the test. Current methods require strict assumptions and cannot accommodate multiple test constraints. The test development strategy to be developed in this project will advance classroom assessment systems in which tests can serve as a part of learning process rather than as a tool to rank students by learning outcomes. Providing accurate, specific, and real-time feedback on multiple criteria for each student is essential for effective learning and remedial instruction. Classroom assessment systems that adopt this new test mode will provide short adaptive tests throughout the year that instantly yield valid and reliable personalized competency diagnoses aligned with educational standards. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, support is provided to enable a promising student to establish a strong, independent research career.<br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation research project will develop a holistic Cognitive Diagnostic Multistage Adaptive Testing (CD-MST) preassembly method that will simultaneously consider numerous types of test constraints. To take full advantage of CD-MST, it is crucial to develop preassembly methods that incorporate not only statistical constraints (e.g., maximizing reliability), but also content constraints (e.g., ensuring all contents tested) without sacrificing estimation precision. Currently, most CD-MST applications have employed on-the-fly CD-MST that assembles modules during an in-progress test session. However, this approach may lead to difficulties in ensuring different versions of equivalent tests and satisfying the non-statistical constraints because the tests are assembled during the testing session. The holistic method to be developed in this project will adapt methods that have been previously proposed for somewhat different contexts:  item selection during an in-progress test session and preassembly for diagnostic adaptive assessment. Simulation studies will be conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the newly developed method. The following three questions will be addressed: 1) Is the holistic CD-MST preassembly method computationally feasible? 2) How well does the holistic CD-MST preassembly method perform across different cognitive diagnostic models and test lengths? 3) How does the performance of a holistic CD-MST preassembly method change with multiple content constraints? The feasibility and performance of the holistic method will be evaluated in terms of the number of constraints violated, examinee classification accuracy (i.e., whether examinees are found to have the skill set that they actually have), the proportion of the item pool used, and the distribution of examinees classifications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such problems have applications in traffic networks, power market pricing, signal processing, risk-averse/robust optimization, and adversarial learning. Many of these application problems impose complicated constraints that must be satisfied. These constraints can arise due to engineering, ethical or legal concerns for the context of the respective application, and often have a functional form. In some cases, the constraint function is data-driven with unknown data distribution - making it impractical to evaluate its value even at a single point. This project aims to develop novel first-order algorithms that can work for VI problems with complex constraints in functional form.<br/><br/>Existing algorithms for VI problems assume that one can efficiently project onto the constraint sets. This assumption is not satisfied when constraints have a general functional form, even more so when the function is data-driven. Hence, the projection requirement severely restricts the applicability of current algorithms to real-world problems of consequence. The algorithms developed as part of this project will solve VI problems without requiring any projection onto complex constraints in functional form. It includes (1) the deterministic problems algorithm evaluates the VI objective and constraint function exactly; (2) data-driven problems where an exact evaluation of the VI objective or the constraint function may not be possible due to large data/unknown underlying distribution; and (3) extending these methods for min-max saddle point problems - an important specific case of the VI problem. The successful completion of this project will yield state-of-the-art algorithms for the VI problem with these complex constraint satisfaction requirements. The proposed algorithms will be equipped with provable convergence guarantees for each of the three subcases above. The project will include a comprehensive numerical validation of the proposed schemes for an equilibrium problem arising from wireless communication. The intellectual property generated as a part of this project, e.g., computer codes, data sets, research articles, and conference proceedings, will be shared with the public through open-source online repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike in vitro diagnostics, in vivo imaging is non-destructive and repeatable, but typically provides information about one or two biological parameters at a given time. Study or detection of complex diseases in a living subject requires information about anatomical, functional (e.g., oxygen saturation), and molecular biomarkers. Therefore, multimodal imaging methods combining conventional imaging techniques - such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Position Emission Tomography and X-Ray Computer Tomography - have gained clinical importance. However, these multimodal technologies are expensive and not suitable for point-of-care (POC) imaging applications. This CAREER project will develop and integrate optical, ultrasound and photoacoustic technologies and demonstrate reliable multimodal POC imaging. The educational outreach activities will prepare female and underrepresented K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students for next generation biomedical imaging device innovation.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to build an integrated research, education and outreach program centered on the science and engineering of next generation smart, affordable, portable, and non-ionizing, multimodal imaging and sensing devices. The research objective is to develop a novel multimodal optical, photoacoustic, and ultrasound imaging platform built at the interface of transparent ultrasound transducer technology, model-based data science tools and artificial intelligence. The platform will be validated for studying neural activity in brain cancer models. The educational objective is to prepare STEM leaders (at K-12, undergraduate and graduate levels) for advancing innovations in smart biomedical imaging and sensing devices through focused seminars and workshops for teachers, live demo of portable ultrasound imaging and inexpensive ultrasound bioreactor for cell stimulation, and new teaching materials at the intersection of multimodal sensing and AI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This REU Site award establishes a new Critical Zone Network Research Experiences for Undergraduates (CZnet-REU) program to support research opportunities for undergraduate students at the many CZ Network research sites across the continental US. Students begin the program at a three-day Kick-off Meeting where they will learn about CZ research, explore connections between CZ science and society, and meet the team for cohort building activities. Each REU student will spend the remainder of the ten-week program at an institution in the CZ Network where they will work closely with a mentor to design and carry out a project focusing on one of many environmental problems important to society. During the summer, the cohort of students will meet virtually 2-3 times each week to stay connected to each other, participate in science communication and other types of training, work on collaborative team projects, and explore the connection between science and society. The summer program ends with a virtual Student Research Symposium and Final Celebration with all mentors, other CZ Net scientists and educators, friends, and family in attendance. CZNet-REU students will have the opportunity to present their research at a national conference, where they will reconnect with their cohort and network with scientists from CZNet and across the discipline. The combination of individual research projects and group collaborations, all carried out as part of a dynamic and supportive network, will prepare students for their careers and foster the creation of innovative solutions to CZ science problems. <br/><br/>Critical Zone (CZ) science is an emerging interdisciplinary endeavor to understand the Earth?s living skin, the layer of the planet from the top of the vegetation canopy to the groundwater depths. The outcomes of CZNet research will be crucial for informing future decisions about how humans interact with the environment. CZNet-REU is a ten-week program involving ten students each summer, recruited nationally and from schools associated with eight Clusters in the CZ Network (CZNet). The group starts with a 3-day Kickoff Meeting and ends with a two-day virtual Wrap-up Meeting, with the core nine weeks spent individually or in pairs at host institutions across the Network. Each mentor provides individual mentoring to the students and connects them to their research group, to other students at their institution, and to others in their Thematic Cluster. During the 9-week research period, twice-weekly virtual workshops, seminars, discussions, and check-ins provide professional development and enrichment, sustain group cohesion and address student concerns. Student research milestones include lightning presentations of research plans, a formal research proposal, updates during group meetings, a poster presentation, and a formal research talk at a final Research Symposium. Students will write a final report and work together on a communication product highlighting connections between CZ and society. Targeted student outcomes of the Critical Zone Collaborative Network Research Experiences for Undergraduates (CZNet-REU) program include: 1) developing research knowledge and skills, as well as interest and identity in Critical Zone (CZ) science; 2) learning to do interdisciplinary and collaborative science in a network; and 3) connecting CZ science to society. CZNet-REU will contribute to the field of CZ science through student research, by broadening participation to bring new faces and perspectives into the new discipline and by assessing the efficacy of this innovative distributed REU model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the world transitions from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles, the market for fuel cells is expected to increase substantially. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) have a number of advantages, such as high durability, long range, and fast refueling over battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Additionally, fuel cells are less susceptible to the supply chain issues that lithium-ion batteries are beginning to suffer from. However, FCEVs are currently at a significant disadvantage to BEVs in terms of cost. Reducing the cost of the fuel cell stack will help to make FCEVs cost competitive with BEVs and will accelerate their adoption into the marketplace.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to reduce the cost of PEM fuel cells by reducing the cost of the bipolar plate component. Bipolar plates currently account for approximately 30% of the full fuel cell stack cost. Current bipolar plates are made from either metal foils or molded carbon composites. Metal plates can be produced by high-speed, low-cost forming techniques, but must be made from expensive, corrosion resistant materials. Carbon bipolar plates are made from inexpensive precursors but are manufactured by processes which scale poorly. This project aims to demonstrate that a bipolar plate can be produced from a novel, low-cost, carbon-based sheet utilizing forming techniques analogous to those used for producing metallic bipolar plates. The effort focuses on optimizing the carbon sheet for low hydrogen permeability, demonstrating that flow channels can be stamped into the sheets, and quantifying functionality and durability by testing in small scale fuel cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet they also present significant safety, user privacy, infrastructure, and planning challenges that must be addressed. The research community ?including computer and data scientists, engineers, and urban planners? has started responding to these challenges, but the progress has been ad hoc and slow. This can be primarily attributed to a lack of micromobility infrastructure for collecting diverse rider, mobility, and contextual data in realistic settings and environments. There is a critical need for a large-scale and easily accessible research instrument to enable such data collection. To this end, this project will design, develop, deploy, and manage ScooterLab, a community research infrastructure comprising a highly customizable fleet of micromobility vehicles. These battery-operated vehicles will be retrofitted with heterogeneous sensing and remote communication and control capabilities to crowd-sense data related to riders? mobility, context, and environment, enabling research at the confluence of (1) multiple computing disciplines, including  machine learning, computer vision, image processing, high-performance computing, big data analytics, and privacy-enhancing technologies; and (2) (micro)mobility, urban planning, and transportation research. The project will provide community researchers with well-designed and usable web interfaces for requesting the deployment of customized sensing experiments and for accessing carefully curated datasets from past experiments and trials. The project will also conduct periodic community outreach and engagement activities, including workshops to promote the testbed?s use and share the outcomes of research activities enabled by the testbed data. <br/><br/>ScooterLab vehicles, besides providing a convenient, electric option to its participants, will serve as excellent instruments to crowd-sense fine-grained, multi-sensor scientific data, enabling new research breakthroughs in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and other interdisciplinary domains. By empowering NSF CISE and other research communities to openly access these scientific datasets, the ScooterLab testbed will engender transformative advancements. Successful development and deployment of ScooterLab will transform micromobility-related and micromobility-supported research at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), the University of Oklahoma (OU), and other collaborating organizations and institutes of higher education. ScooterLab will improve opportunities nationally for attracting and sustaining CISE, engineering, urban planning, and policy faculty and students working on emerging intelligent transportation and mobility solutions. The ScooterLab testbed will also serve as a foundational research instrument for UTSA?s recently launched School of Data Science located in downtown San Antonio, and contribute to the university?s initiatives to reduce its carbon emissions. As a Minority-Serving Institution (59% Hispanic and 53% Female), UTSA will provide extensive research and participation opportunities for people of color and women.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These geohazards can cause loss of human life and destroy infrastructure. Unfortunately, the scientific community has yet to devise a way to forecast these events. This work aims to determine whether measurements of the density of excited vibrational modes (DoM), a technique that has successfully provided a precursor signal to failure in the laboratory context, provide a route forward. To date, this technique has yet to be tested in natural samples. The researchers will develop the technique first in beach sands, then possibly in more complex near-surface environments, including for data already being collected and published by other groups. Professors on the team will lead a diverse group of STEM students across disciplinary boundaries, using best practices developed by experts that emphasize collaborations and mentorship.<br/> <br/>The ground beneath our feet shifts over time, sometimes slowly creeping, sometimes flowing like a fluid, and sometimes suddenly failing. These shifts cause landslides, submarine slides, ground fissures, and liquefaction. These geohazards' frequency and destructive capabilities have increased as global warming worsens, sea levels rise, and extreme weather events intensify. The current state-of-the-art lacks a reliable way to forecast these events, largely due to a lack of reliable methods for incorporating soil-scale information into failure models. This proposal hypothesizes that measurements of the density of excited vibrational modes (DoM), a statistical physics quantity that provides well-established failure precursors signals (broadening and increase in excess of low-frequency modes) within lab-reconstituted and numerically simulated granular materials, provides a route forward. The work seeks to answer the following questions: ?How do DoM measurements complement and correspond to bulk geophysical measurements?? and ?Does the DoM provide insight into the evolving state of naturally-deposited sediments??  These efforts would represent the first application of the DoM technique in the natural sediments; if successful, the translation of the technique to Earth settings would provide a new way to identify and monitor slope stability-related hazards within the near surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Noise makes speech and other sounds of interest harder to hear, but also conveys information about the world around us, telling us how hard it is raining, whether the room next to us is full of people, or how close a kettle may be to boiling. Humans excel both at separating other sounds from background noise and at recognizing the causes of the noise in the world. Understanding these abilities could enable more effective hearing aids, cochlear implants, and speech-based machine systems such as those in our phones. Here the investigators propose to study human abilities to hear in noisy conditions.<br/><br/>The proposed work will jointly pursue three goals. First, the investigators will develop a computational framework to understand the properties of noise that underlie human perception. This will involve assembling a large data set of environmental noises and measuring their statistical properties. These properties will then be related to human perception by synthesizing sounds that have the same properties and asking whether they are realistic and recognizable to humans. Second, the investigators will measure the ability of human listeners to perceptually separate noise from other sounds. They will then build models that can predict the conditions in which such separation should succeed or fail. Third, the investigators will measure the ability of human listeners to remember different noises and develop a model to explain why some sounds are better remembered than others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across the nation today, it is common to find many dozens of pervasive yet undocumented wireless devices controlling everything from circuit breakers on the power grid to aviation fuel trucks, city water valves, and even configurable speed signs. Operators wirelessly connect to infrastructure to remotely monitor and control it, a task that previously was hazardous and time consuming because it required physically accessing the infrastructure. Unfortunately, wireless access has created a new vector for attackers to gain access to critical infrastructure while evading all existing cyber and physical defenses. This project introduces new methodologies, tools, and education programs, seeding the growth of a new class of wireless cyber-defenses that can protect widely distributed wireless infrastructure. The project?s education efforts will accelerate the growth of wireless infrastructure security through outreach efforts to critical infrastructure operators, and hands-on computer security research training for underrepresented students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop generalized wireless security principles for distributed and diverse deployments of wireless devices. (1) The project will result in a universal mobile wireless scanning methodology that can rapidly find devices across all frequencies and protocols and identify wireless devices used in critical infrastructure across large areas in a short time. (2) In addition, project activities include large-scale measurements and the development of new wireless fingerprinting methodologies to produce the first taxonomy of vulnerabilities in wirelessly controlled critical infrastructure.

Understanding how objects move, sound, and feel like can improve human-robot collaboration in tasks such as assembling components in manufacturing environments or sorting objects in warehouses and distribution centers. However, learned object knowledge by one robot cannot easily be used by a different robot, with a different body, sensors, and movement actions. In practice, this means that when a new robot is deployed, it has to learn many of its skills and much of its knowledge from scratch. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will develop methods for transferring object knowledge across robots so that a newly deployed robot can make sense of the experiences of other robots that have operated in the same or similar environments. This project will facilitate the ability of collaborative robots in homes and workplaces to perceive and reason about the properties of objects. Robots in assistive settings will be better at learning tasks that require the sense of touch, for example, helping a disabled person take off their shoes. The project will also improve robots? ability to connect language to visual and non-visual perception, for example, helping robots recognize that a particular object can be referred to as ?soft?, which is important when humans and robots use language to communicate about objects.<br/><br/>Multisensory object knowledge includes recognition models that ground language in multiple sensory modalities (e.g., a classifier that recognizes if an object is ?soft? given haptic readings produced when pressing the object) as well as forward models which predict changes in the robot?s environment as a result of its actions. The research objective of this project is to enable multiple heterogeneous robots to learn and share multisensory object knowledge to reduce the amount of interaction data each individual robot needs to collect. This project hypothesizes that two or more robots with different embodiments and sensors can learn to transfer multisensory representations through the use of shared embedding spaces, to which robots map their own experiences and from which they learn using the experiences of other robots. This research will develop the theoretical framework for such transfer along with algorithms and representations that scale to large numbers of robots, sensory modalities, objects, and interaction behaviors. Experimental evaluation will be conducted using existing datasets in the beginning, as well as new datasets with increasing complexity that will be collected with multiple robotic platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Silicate weathering can scrub carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and is considered a natural feedback that can counter the rise in global temperatures, thus maintaining a habitable climate. The analysis of the potassium (K) isotopes in silicate rocks has been closely linked to understanding past silicate weathering rates. However, recent research suggests that formation of new silicate clay minerals from the byproducts of silicate weathering may reverse the chemical reactions of silicate weathering thus making the processes less effective in cooling the planet. The formation of clays from byproducts, a process termed ?reverse weathering?, is challenging to study as it occurs in remote sectors of the deep ocean and the reaction rates are slow. Thus, this presents a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the long-term silicate and carbon cycles impacting what we know about past, present, and future climate. This project develops stable potassium isotopes as a novel proxy, or tracer, to help quantify modern and past silicate weathering rates. Via analyzing potassium isotopes in Earth materials, this project investigates the modern and past potassium cycle and its relationship to silicate weathering and the global carbon cycle. The study will quantify changes in marine potassium isotopes, helping to provide robust estimates on the global significance of marine clay formation and its impact on climate. Through a comprehensive plan integrating research and education, this project (1) supports geochemistry infrastructure to fulfill research and education missions of the university; (2) provides laboratory training for undergraduate and graduate students along with educational opportunities for primary and secondary students; (3) extends accessibility of a modern geochemical laboratory beyond the campus boundary to attract and build a diversified workforce in geochemistry-related fields; and (4) raises public awareness of the societal relevance of geochemistry research and of our planet.<br/><br/>The research aims to advance understanding of the marine stable potassium (K) isotopic cycle to develop a robust proxy for silicate weathering. This project applies controlled laboratory experiments and analysis of purposefully selected natural marine samples to constrain key uncertainties in the modern marine potassium isotopic cycle, including potassium isotope fractionation during seawater?basalt alterations and clay formation. Isotope mass balance models are being applied to quantitatively estimate the global significance of present-day clay formation or reverse weathering. Additionally, laboratory experiments, supplemented by spectroscopic characterization and a modeling approach, will advance knowledge on potassium isotope exchange kinetics and fractionation pertinent to derivation of seawater potassium isotope compositions from relevant geologic archives such as marine evaporites. Deliverables include development of an interpretative framework that will enable the use of geological archives to reconstruct potassium isotope signatures in ancient oceans and to assess their implications to the long-term carbon cycle. Through the integration of research and education, this project advances interdisciplinary research in potassium isotopes and expands application of the developing tool to the complex plant?soil?climate feedbacks in the context of changing climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, the enabling technology for stateful In-network computing, namely the programmable switches, have fundamental design limitations that prevent them from scaling to the growing demands of both the current and emerging In-network applications. In particular, current generation of programmable switches cannot simultaneously run large number of applications, cannot store large amounts of state needed for state-intensive applications, and cannot scale to line rate processing for certain stateful applications. This project will investigate the design of next-generation programmable switches that could simultaneously run large number of applications, store and process large amounts of state, while running at multi-Tbps line rate, at the cost of only a nominal increase in chip area and power consumption compared to current programmable switches.<br/><br/>The limitations of current programmable switches were studied previously in the context of microprocessor-based network processors from the early 2000s. However, the fundamental difference in the processing architecture and line rate of microprocessor-based network processors compared to  current programmable switches, has opened an opportunity to re-visit these problems in a completely new light. In that regard, this project will make three key innovations. First, the project will investigate new ways to store and access shared state across multiple parallel switch pipelines for achieving line rate processing for stateful applications. Second, the project will investigate ways to dynamically allocate and share switch resources at line rate, providing an abstraction of a ""virtual"" programmable switch to each application, in order to scale to large number of applications. And finally, the project will investigate optimal cache designs (between on-chip SRAM and off-chip DRAM) that allow visibility into future requests at runtime through co-ordination between neighbor switches in the network, to support state-intensive applications at line rate.<br/><br/>This project also proposes several educational and outreach initiatives that will be tightly integrated with the proposed research. The systems and applications developed as part of this project will be integrated into the curriculum of both the existing and new courses at Purdue, including courses from non-networking domains, such as distributed systems and computer architecture.<br/>As part of the K-12 and underrepresented minority outreach, this project will organize an annual 1-week summer workshop at Purdue targeting high-school and incoming undergraduate students belonging to communities historically underrepresented in computer science and engineering, to encourage them to pursue a career in science and engineering by giving them hands-on experience with state-of-the-art networking technologies developed as part of this project.<br/><br/>All the results and artifacts from this project, including the source code, will be made publicly and permanently available at the URL https://github.com/vishal1303.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proper cell motility is necessary for wound healing, development, and normal tissue maintenance. Cells must be flexible enough to move and comply with external physical stresses yet strong enough to maintain shape and structural integrity. Thus, while a soft cell nucleus is conducive to cell migration through small pores in tissue, the resulting physical stress (if not mitigated) can lead to nuclear damage and pathogenic conditions. Vimentin is a cytoskeletal component of many migrating cells and is important to nuclear positioning and nuclear stability. However, how vimentin is uniquely able to protect the nucleus is still largely unknown. This research will explore how vimentin enables cells to sense and respond to mechanical stresses. The results of this work shed light on the mechanical and biological signals that control cell migration. This research is complemented by an integrated educational and outreach plan. This plan aims to broaden STEM pathways by attracting and training students through 1) a novel open-access traction force microscopy tool, and 2) a novel course, Public Engagement in Physics and STEM. High school students from Syracuse City School Districts will engage in both outreach activities.<br/><br/>The overall research goal of this project is to uncover the biophysical mechanisms by which the cytoskeletal polymer vimentin stabilizes confined cell migration and its role in reinforcing proper nuclear translocation. The study is organized around three objectives: 1) determining the role of vimentin in nuclear shape and deformability, 2) defining how vimentin establishes whole cell polarization and traction stress during 3D migration, and 3) probing vimentin?s role in mechanotransduction pathways associated with cellular response to compressive forces. The findings from this work will provide important new insight into mechanisms of healthy tissue maintenance and disease progression that advance through fundamental cell migration processes. In the longer-term, project outcomes will suggest new strategies to aid cell motility during wound healing as well as disrupt abnormal cell motility and nuclear damage in pathological contexts, such as fibrosis and cancer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon is known as ?developmental plasticity,? which in some extreme cases acts as a ?switch? between alternative and often strikingly different forms. In some examples, such switches have been defined in terms of individual genes and the products they encode. However, a persistent challenge has been to understand how these switches, specifically the molecular processes responsible, evolve in nature. The goal of this research is to identify, using species of nematodes that assume different feeding-forms in response to starvation and local competition, the genetic basis for how developmental plasticity evolves. Moreover, by drawing on multiple, complementary types of variation in plasticity among populations, the project will determine which features, if any, are generalizable across them. The project will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in research that integrates genetics, developmental biology, and evolution. The research will also support two science-outreach programs at Indiana University: (i) the investigating laboratory will host and mentor high-school students in their own research projects in an annual summer program, and (ii) the principal investigator will guide Indiana high-school teachers in developing projects, experiments, and activities to be implemented in the classroom to improve the teaching and learning of state life-science standards.<br/><br/>This research will advance a functional-genetic understanding of the evolution of polyphenism, or discrete developmental plasticity. Using a model system for developmental genetics, Pristionchus nematodes, this research will link defined molecular mechanisms of a morphological polyphenism to the allelic variants that explain natural variation in that polyphenism. First, the research will determine the quantitative genetic basis for observed divergence of plastic responses between wild isolates of the species Pristionchus pacificus. This aim will be met by mapping, validating, and functionally characterizing allelic variants causing differences in a threshold response to the environment. Second, the research will determine the quantitative genetic basis for hidden divergence of polyphenism regulation between wild isolates with similar plastic responses. This aim will be met by revealing how combinations of variants, which can be uncovered through transgressive phenotypes, are responsible for polyphenism evolution. Third, the research will experimentally determine the repeatability of proximal mechanisms for plasticity evolution. This aim will be met by replicating scenarios of experimental evolution of Pristionchus populations in response to a polyphenism-influencing environment. By integrating a model for polyphenism genetics into a microevolutionary framework, the research will describe: (i) the molecular capacity of polyphenism?s regulatory mechanisms to change; (ii) how generalizable the types of changes are across parallel cases of divergence; (iii) the impact of diverging plasticity modifiers on the polyphenism developmental network, including those components that effect the ultimate forms produced.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will integrate various observations, for example, shipboard, autonomous float, satellite measurement, with high-performance computing. This project will help identify the causes of model biases and contribute to future model development. This study will engage local undergraduates as student assistants from nearby HBCUs in the Atlanta area and through summer REU program. <br/><br/>The project is organized into three themes. First is the integration of in-vitro, in-situ and satellite observations of biological productivity. Second is the development of a regional carbon and ecosystem model. Third is characterization of spatial and temporal variability of biological productivity and air-sea carbon flux. The main objective is to quantify and reduce uncertainty in the regional biological carbon uptake through the combination of in situ and vitro methods and modeling. The field component will utilize the Line P time-series cruise in June 2024. Incubation experiments (13C, 15NO3, 15NH4) at five major stations will be conducted together with high-resolution underway O2/Ar measurements. This will quantify primary production and carbon export. To increase data coverage, autonomous floats and satellite observations will be incorporated. The new and existing observations will be used to validate and calibrate a new 3-dimensional regional ecosystem and carbon cycle model at eddy-resolving resolution. This model will be calibrated, then this model will be used to carry out multi-decadal simulation (1995-present).

The textbook model of the cell cycle describes a single state of arrest but is mostly silent on whether this state consists of multiple arrested states; how cells may enter or exit these states; and how cells transition from reversible to irreversible arrest. This project will define the molecular steps that govern reversible and irreversible arrest and reveal how flexible the cell cycle is. These research objectives are deeply integrated with two community outreach activities that will engage a diverse group of students and scientists. Building on a long-term partnership with Durham public schools, seventh-grade students will learn the fundamentals of the cell cycle as well as the technical skills needed to perform microscopy. The project also draws on an existing partnership with the University of North Carolina's 'Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children' Program to employ two neurodiverse individuals to perform image analysis of cell cycle data.<br/><br/>The first aim of this project focuses on reversible cell cycle arrest with the specific goal of determining how cells resume G1 and enter S phase following quiescence, a temporary state of cell cycle arrest. Perturbation experiments will test mechanisms by which the accumulation of CDKs/cyclins overwhelms pro-arrest factors to promote cell cycle re-entry. The second aim investigates mechanisms controlling irreversible cell cycle arrest, a phenotype commonly associated with cellular senescence. Time-lapse imaging and computational modeling will identify the precise sequence of molecular steps governing transition to permanent arrest. Systematic perturbation of G1 and G2 regulators are expected to relax the permanency of arrest. Successful completion of these research objectives will fill critical knowledge gaps in how the cell cycle is organized and regulated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet the rising demand of an increasing human population for plant oils will require increased oil production and optimization of plant oil fatty acid compositions for societal applications. Current knowledge indicates that plant oil biosynthesis overlaps with essential membrane lipid production required for cellular function. This research is elucidating how plants balance accumulation of oil with synthesis of membrane lipids so that crop breeding and plant bioengineering efforts can optimize plant oil production without affecting the properties of biological membranes. The project uses genetic mutants, overexpression lines, protein localization and dynamic interactions, in vivo isotopic labeling, and mathematical modeling of non-stationary flux to produce a quantitative description of lipid metabolic network function and dynamics. New engineering strategies based on project results may provide alternative sources of nutritionally valuable food oils, or chemically reactive lipids that can functionally replace petroleum in chemical syntheses. Project results could also lead to the development of new value-added crops that can reinvigorate low-income rural farming communities. This project collaborates with the EXploring College Emerging Leaders (EXCEL) program at Washington State University that seeks to increase participation of Native American communities in STEM subjects. The three postdoctoral scientists, one post bachelor researcher, and multiple undergraduate students are being trained in scientific research and outreach to become the next generation of scientific leaders who will face future scientific challenges and enhance agricultural output for societal gain. <br/><br/>Valuable plant oils and essential membrane lipids are assembled by an overlapping metabolic network. The path of fatty acid flux through the network ultimately determines the final oil fatty acid composition, yet how plants control fatty acid flux through this network of lipid assembly is unknown. An important particular unknown is how plants control the use of key intermediates (diacylglycerol) between membrane and oil biosynthesis. This research leverages the expertise of a multi-disciplinary team to elucidate lipid metabolic network structure, fluxes, and sub-cellular spatial organization. A combination of genetic mutants, over-expression lines, protein localization and dynamic interactions, in vivo isotopic labeling, and mathematical modeling is used to develop a quantitative description of lipid metabolic network function and dynamics. This quantitative picture includes the cellular organization and the enzymatic control of fatty acid flux through different branches of the lipid metabolic network that affect seed oil accumulation and composition. The knowledge gained will result in a paradigm shift beyond the current network descriptions of static metabolites that have previously been used to develop bioengineering strategies. In vivo isotopic labeling-based metabolic flux maps enhance the quantitative and dynamic understanding of lipid network function and enable improved engineering efforts. The project also provides important new tools to help guide the design of better metabolic engineering (or targeted breeding) strategies to meet the plant oil needs of the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current approaches to ion trapping face a tradeoff between scalability and trap quality (e.g., the depth and uniformity of the trapping potential). This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) Quantum Manufacturing award supports development of a new ion trap architecture providing both electrical and optical control, without sacrificing manufacturability. Silicon fabrication techniques will be explored to create electrodes that increase optical access, a multi-wafer alignment and bonding process will improve trap quality, and thin focusing optics will be directly fabricated and aligned with the trapping electrodes. These advancements will enable trapping, controlling, and measuring thousands of individual ions across a centimeter-scale device. This work represents the first steps towards defining the manufacturing process for a trapped ion quantum computer. Additionally, the growing quantum industry will need a trained workforce to design, build, and test these next-generation devices. By participating in the research, students will be trained in pertinent skills and develop a quantum literacy.

An important subset of plastics is photopolymer, or crosslinked materials created with light. Photopolymers make up the polymer component of materials commonly used in 3D printing, dentistry, and biomaterials, however, only a limited window of mechanical properties can easily be accessed from available chemical feedstocks. In the work proposed here, Dr. Worrell and his team will create catalysts that have the potential to significantly alter the mechanical properties of photopolymers while keeping >99% of the chemical composition the same. Dr. Worrell will also establish and run the Summer High school Internships: New Experimentalists at University of Denver (SHINE @ DU) program, which aims to offer local, under-represented high school students real-world research experiences hosted in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry. An undergraduate led online journal detailing scalable, simple, and inexpensive preparations of organic polymers is to be established as part of this CAREER award effort.<br/><br/>The materials generated by photopolymerization are inherently highly crosslinked and suffer from significant shrinkage stress, are often brittle, and have a limited range of material properties. Various classes of chain transfer agents (CTAs) have been investigated and developed to reduce the crosslinking density of photopolymers. Although CTAs are successful in manipulating the mechanical properties of photopolymers, they are required in high loadings (up to 20 wt% of total formulation) and frequently contain sulfur which is malodorous and can create unstable formulations. Dr. Worrell and his research team are developing a catalytic, sulfur-free CTA that can be added in ppm quantities to existing commercial monomer feedstocks to create photopolymers similar to those prepared using traditional CTAs, but at 10,000x lower loadings.  Several analogs of the macrocyclic cobalt(II) catalyst will be explored to improve resin solubility and various ligands will be screened in a high-throughput fashion in the search for potent catalyst:ligand combinations. These catalytic CTAs will be tested in commercial 3D printing resins and liquid crystal elastomers to narrow and reduce the glass transition temperature, reduce storage modulus, and alter other pertinent mechanical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decade-to-decade variations are typically characterized by a set of climate modes such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), in which the Atlantic north of the equator has alternating episodes of warming and cooling that last 20 to 40 years. The climate modes are generally regarded as natural variability because they can be found in observations from the 1800s and earlier, before the rise of industrial emissions.  For this reason regional climate change is often viewed as the superposition of natural variability in the form of climate modes and externally forced change which is distinct from the modes, with a different spatial pattern and involving different physical mechanisms.<br/><br/>Here the Principal Investigators (PIs) question this assumption and pose a more challenging hypothesis: prior to 1950 climate modes are largely natural variability arising from atmosphere-ocean coupling, but after 1950 the modes are largely externally forced, and the relationship between the ocean and atmosphere is altered by the external forcing. The hypothesis is motivated by the PIs' recent work with simulations of 20th century climate which include forcing by the radiative effects of aerosol pollution.  The dominant sources of aerosol emissions have shifted from western Europe and the eastern US to China and southern Asia, thus the response to shifting aerosol radiative forcing could cause regional climate change on the decadal timescale.  The hypothesis is also predicated on the idea that the climate system responds to external forcing through the dynamics that generate the internal variability modes, so that the response to external forcing amounts to an excitation of the natural internal modes.<br/><br/>The research is conducted with a variety of climate model simulations including large ensembles (LEs) of simulations performed with the Community Earth System Model (CESM).  These include LEs of simulations with no external forcing and single-forcing simulations which isolate the response to aerosol forcing.  The work also takes advantage of the hierarchy of simpler configurations developed for CESM, including the ""pencil ocean"" configuration developed under AGS-2040073, which represents turbulent vertical heat transfer in the ocean but does not simulate the lateral movement of water in ocean currents.<br/><br/>The work has societal relevance given the need to address climate change impacts at the regional level.  If the PIs' hypothesis is correct it will require some revision of uncertainty estimates for regional climate projections, which do not currently take into account uncertainty in the future evolution of aerosol emissions.  The work also has implications for climate prediction efforts, in which it is commonly assumed that climate modes can be predicted from the current state of the atmosphere and oceans and a sufficiently accurate representation of the coupling between the two (see for example AGS-2231237).  The work is also directly relevant to climate impacts on coastal communities, particularly given that the AMO has a substantial effect on Atlantic hurricane activity.  The researchers work with the Miami Climate Resilience Committee and the Resilient305 Research Collaborative provides a direct application of research results to community-based decision making.  The project also provides support and training to a postdoctoral associate, a graduate student and an undergraduate, and the PIs perform a number of outreach activities including the University of Miami Women in Science day, an annual event for girls in the 6th and 7th grade.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have proliferated America?s college campuses, with initial creation costs in the thousands to millions of dollars. While emerging data demonstrate the tremendous impact makerspaces may create in the engineering learning experience especially for learning engineering-relevant skills, data also demonstrate that makerspaces fail to meet aspirations of being open and welcoming spaces for all. Currently, it is difficult to determine the learning impact of a makerspace and to compare different makerspaces structures or makerspaces at different institutions with different populations of students. Drawing upon qualitative research that identified the modes and contents of learning in university makerspaces, this project will create and validate an instrument that measures student learning in makerspaces: the Learning through Making survey Instrument. The Learning through Making Instrument will provide a tool for researchers and educators to assess the educational value of makerspaces, compare across different environments, experiment with different approaches, document the learning impacts, and ultimately facilitate understanding how makerspaces can enhance engineering education. This instrument will assist educators in understanding learning gaps that may be associated with obstacles for students providing educators with data critical for designing more makerspaces and associated curriculum that broaden participation and cultivate more accessible and welcoming learning communities. The Learning through Making Instrument will be developed and validated for collegiate students providing a springboard for quantitative research on learning in makerspaces and will facilitate future development of similar instruments applicable for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The research objective is to develop a survey for measuring learning in university makerspaces and similar environments. The proposal team?s prior work, The Learning through Making Typology will be a partial basis for development of the Learning through Making Instrument. Data for instrument development and validations with diverse engineering students will occur at very different universities, including San Jose State, Texas State, Texas A&M, Purdue University, Georgia Tech, and James Madison University. The selection includes two Hispanic-Serving Institutions in two different regions of the country; a comprehensive, mid-Atlantic, regional, undergraduate-focused university offering only a general engineering degree; research-focused universities; and a top school for graduating Black and women engineers that also has dual-degree programs providing access to students from HBCUs. These universities also provide a contrasting set of makerspaces. An initial pool of items will be generated, experts will evaluate the pool of items, and evidence of reliability along with structural validity will be sought by exploratory factor analysis and then confirmatory factor analysis. Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing indicate that fairness of assessments is just as crucial as validity and reliability, and fairness will be evaluated as a key part of this research. We seek to answer the following Research Questions: To what extent are measurement construct specifications and actual assessment questions aligned? To what extent are there measurement invariances between different groups of students? Are there significant differences in the mean scores between groups that indicate certain groups are learning differently in makerspaces?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new technological tools are expected to simplify the workflow, reduce costs and time, and enable the prediction of COVID-19 outbreaks and other pandemics several weeks before observing clinical cases. Such early prediction would provide the public and government agencies with important data and sufficient time to take preventive measures. The technological products of this project are expected to empower the growing number of companies and laboratories offering wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) services and help establish WBE as a routine, cost-effective and reliable tool for public health monitoring.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a major technological barrier for the detection of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Commercially available nucleic acid collection and purification kits are designed for clinical samples with small volumes.  These kits are not generally used for large wastewater volumes where the virus is present at low concentrations. As a result, current processes are time-consuming, and result in the recovery of less than 30% of viruses and nucleic acids, significantly reducing the sensitivity. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel virus and nucleic acid collection and purification technology from wastewater. Specifically, the project tasks aim at enhancing understanding of virus properties, particularly human coronaviruses in wastewater and their interactions with filter media. The project?s innovative approach is to design a streamlined workflow that includes all the steps from sample collection to detection, in a single disposable cartridge containing novel filters with high affinity to viruses. This development is expected to enhance viral and nucleic acid recovery in wastewater to over 90%, while reducing costs.

This project will address the several challenges facing the US battery industry.  First, the state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery cathode materials use scarce and expensive elements, such as cobalt and nickel.  Second, the US battery manufacturing capability needs to be improved in order to meet the rapidly growing demand, cathode materials production is especially important.  Third, current lithium-ion battery cathode manufacturing involves costly liquid and gaseous waste management. The proposed technology will create fundamentally new ways to produce next-generation cathodes for American electric vehicles. This project can significantly impact the battery field since the proposed new cathode technology is expected to result in a major cost reduction per electric vehicle battery pack. Advances in novel cathode chemistries and manufacturing processes offer new opportunities for the US to establish the leadership in cathode innovation and manufacturing. <br/><br/>This project develops a fundamentally disruptive technology to enable the use of low-cost, cobalt- and nickel-free oxide cathodes in high-energy lithium-ion batteries. The dry manufacturing technology will be uniquely combined with new materials development to enable stable battery cycling with a 700 Wh/kg specific energy at the cathode materials level. The technology is compatible with mainstream lithium-ion electrolytes and anodes, which makes full-cell integration feasible and practical at the commercial scale. The research and development objectives include: (1) design, manufacturing, and characterization of new cobalt- and nickel-free oxide cathode chemistries with abundant and low-cost elements, (2) develop cathode electrodes with controllable physical properties based on an all-dry electrode preparation process, and (3) integrate the graphite anode and electrochemical measurements under various practical testing conditions. This project proposes to combine materials synthesis and electrode powder mixing and to avoid the costly materials storage and handling between cathode powder production and cathode electrode manufacturing.

Cities are concentrated consumers of energy and resources and producers of various wastes, but they are also centers of social networks, innovation, efficiency, and solutions. The Central Arizona?Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research program (CAP V) is a research project that includes scientists from a variety of disciplines focused on understanding cities as hybrid ecosystems including both environmental and human components, and their interactions.  Understanding urban ecosystems remains the central focus of  CAP V after 25 years of innovative research. The interconnectedness of human motivation, behavior, actions, and outcomes with urban ecosystem structure and function leads to a fundamental question addressed by this project.  How have/are human-environment interactions mediated by urban ecological infrastructure to shape past, present, and future ecosystem functions? This project will  further indicate how we can use knowledge of these relationships to inform more just, transformative, and sustainable futures.  Broader societal impacts are intentionally integrated in CAP V research, with many activities involving explicit partnerships with practitioners and communities that historically have had little voice in the future of their city and environment. This work forms a translational link among social-ecological research outcomes, city institutions, and communities with the goal of ultimately making Phoenix, and cities in general, better and more sustainable places to live.  <br/><br/>CAP research will extend its focus on the theory of Urban Ecological Infrastructure (UEI) as a critical bridge between the system?s biophysical and human/social domains. CAP researchers will continue to explore interdisciplinary urban ecology in residential landscapes, urban waterbodies, desert parks and preserves, while examining the plants, animals, climate, urban design and governance across the metropolitan Phoenix region. New research initiatives will include a focus on urban air quality and develop both knowledge and practical solutions with and for local communities. CAP V research is organized around five interdisciplinary areas: 1) ecosystem structure and function and biogeochemical cycling; 2) adaptation and eco-evolutionary dynamics; 3) urban climate and air quality; 4) urban nature and human perceptions, decisions, and wellbeing; and 5) governance for transformative futures. Investigating these questions, in the context of the previous 25 years of CAP research, will guide the CAP research endeavor towards more sustainable and resilient futures for U.S. cities and for our increasingly urban society.<br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the Division of Environmental Biology and the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the postulates of quantum mechanics underpinning quantum algorithms, create unique challenges that need to be overcome in order to expand their applications. This project investigates the power and limitations of quantum walks, which is a quantum analogue of classical random walks. Quantum walks have been used in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms; from finding a marked vertex in a graph to simulation of quantum systems. Despite this, the dynamical behavior of the ?quantum walker? is not well understood, which can be highly non-trivial due to its wave-like interference properties. This makes it difficult to effectively guide the propagation of the ?quantum walker? when the underlying geometry of the search problem is complicated. The primary aim of this project is to develop mathematical and algorithmic tools to broaden our understanding of quantum walks. Through education, curriculum development and outreach activities, the project will also contribute towards training an interdisciplinary cohort of students in quantum computing. Further, this project will foster research across mathematics (group and representation theory, simplicial homology, graph theory), physics (scattering theory, quantum walks) and computer science (property testing, subgraph finding). <br/><br/>Expanding the applications of quantum walks poses several challenges. First, it is difficult to derive analytical expressions for the resulting distribution of certain important classes of quantum walks, even on highly symmetric graphs. This is due to the presence of destructive interference. Second, we do not have a good understanding of when quantum walks can lead to super-polynomial or exponential speedup. Third, apart from a few carefully constructed examples, we do not know how to apply quantum walks to find or detect non-trivial subgraphs of a given graph. To overcome some of the above obstacles, this project undertakes a systematic study of quantum walks as a generative model for non-trivial distributions on vertices and edges of graphs and their higher dimensional extensions such as simplicial complexes (SC). The resulting theory will be used in testing certain properties of and finding complex sub-structures within these objects. More specifically, the following topics will be investigated: dynamics of quantum walks on non-abelian Cayley graphs and SCs with certain cohomologies, applications of quantum walks for property testing and search problems on SCs, and  connection between scattering quantum walks and the symmetries of the underlying graph.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these regulations are intended to protect consumers, they also inevitably make it more expensive and time-intensive for companies to bring new medical technology to the market. These hurdles could leave consumers with fewer products to choose from or even delay their access to potentially life-saving medical technology. Without the threat of new entrants, existing firms are able to charge higher prices, knowing that consumers have few alternatives. Focusing on medical devices, the author(s) asks whether relaxing FDA regulation could increase the quality and accessibility of health care and combat rising costs. This project combines new data on millions of medical products with statistical analysis to understand how deregulation affects competition, prices, quantity, and quality in the market for medical devices. Specifically, the author(s) will study an FDA deregulation event in 2015 that deregulated some medical devices but not others. The results of this study will be valuable for policymakers who seek to make informed decisions about how to balance the benefits of product regulation against the costs it imposes on firms and consumers.<br/><br/>Products regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) account for 20 cents out of every dollar Americans spend (Food and Drug Administration, 2021). On the one hand, these regulations ? which often take the form of pre-market approval processes ? aim to ensure the safety and efficacy of consumer products. On the other hand, pre-market approvals can impose substantial costs on manufacturers, which prevent firm entry and can even reduce product safety (Rogers, 2022). This project considers how FDA regulation interacts with market forces and the resulting effect on the cost and quality of products in an important sector: medical devices. The author(s) bring together detailed data on market entry, device transactions, and insurance claims with econometric methods to answer this question. They exploit a 2015 FDA deregulation event that removed pre-market testing for 250 medical device types as a ?natural experiment? and use difference-in-difference and event study techniques to compare the effects on deregulated versus unaffected device types. They first use FDA registration data to assess the effects on market structure, like the number and types of firms that sell these devices. Next, they use fine-grained data on millions of medical device purchases made by healthcare providers to study the effects on prices and quantities of devices purchased. Finally, they use insurer claims and consider whether the prices, quantity, and quality of procedures that use these devices change. The project?s findings will provide policymakers with a better understanding of how regulation interacts with market forces and causes ripple effects throughout the supply chain in an important industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viruses such as influenza A virus, rabies, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses (COVID19), use a wide variety of strategies to attach to and enter their hosts? epithelial cells. In many of these examples, however, the detailed mechanisms still remain unclear and urgent research is needed to gain the key information that would enable the development of innovative preventive and therapeutic strategies for viral disease. This research project uses the zebrafish model system to address questions about the mechanisms involved in viral infection, with focus on the role(s) of sugar-binding proteins (galectins) in viral adhesion. Several galectin types are present in both fish and humans, and function in defense against viral infection. A recent study by the investigators revealed that a particular galectin type (galectin-9) promotes viral infectivity. These observations established a new paradigm for the role of galectins as anti-viral defense factors, as they suggest that some viruses have evolved to ?hijack? galectins to facilitate viral host entry. By the use of innovative experimental approaches and state-of-the-art molecular tools, this project is aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which galectin-9 promotes viral infection. The research will provide critical and useful information for viral infections relevant to human and veterinary medicine, including commercial aquaculture. Importantly, these studies will also contribute to the education and hands-on training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, including students from underrepresented minorities.  <br/><br/>The infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is one of the most important fish pathogens in natural and farmed populations worldwide. Environmental stress and high-density aquaculture can lead to catastrophic IHNV outbreaks. Infection by IHNV involves interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein spikes with glycoprotein receptor(s) on the fish epithelia, but the mechanisms remain unknown. The investigator?s lab addresses structural/functional aspects of sugar-binding proteins expressed by the host, such as galectins, in infectious disease using both murine and non-mammalian models, such as zebrafish. Several structurally different galectin types have been described (e.g. galectin-1, Gal1; Gal3; and Gal9). While the zebrafish Gal1 and Gal3 hinder IHNV viral adhesion, Gal9, which houses two sugar-recognition domains, promotes viral infectivity. This led to the hypothesis that zebrafish Gal9 enhances viral attachment by crosslinking the viral envelope glycoprotein to fish epithelial glycans, and that under environmental stress the protective role of epidermal mucus is diminished. The hypothesis will be tested by investigating though state-of-the-art biochemical, molecular, and genetic experimental approaches the mechanism(s) involved in Gal9-mediated enhancement of IHNV entry into the host epithelial cell, and potential increase of viral replication, the epidermal mucus? protective role, and the detrimental effect of stressful environmental conditions. This research will be examine the long-held concept of galectins as defense factors against infectious disease, and will unravel basic infection mechanisms pertinent to other enveloped viruses (e.g. influenza, rabies, and coronavirus) of human and veterinary relevance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since alkyl diamine N-hydroxylase monooxygenases (NMOs) are involved in siderophore biosynthesis, the novel siderophores will likely be the product of unique NMOs. It is expected that NMOs involved in novel siderophore biosynthesis have broader substrate specificity, making them a target for identifying and developing new industrial biocatalysts. For example, hydroxylamines, valuable building blocks in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, are enzymatically made in a single step from primary amines in the biosynthesis of hydroxamate siderophores.

However, such initiatives are often grounded in technical and quantitative metrics produced without input from laypeople affected by environmental disparities. Many residents in EJ communities assert that these metrics do not properly capture their knowledge or experience nor address their concerns. This research examines how lay people and technical experts measure pollution differently and investigates how and why communities? knowledge and experience with pollution are not translated into policy action. The results of this project will be widely disseminated to academic, public, and policy audiences to provide actionable strategies to better incorporate lay knowledge into the development of community-centered public policy.<br/><br/>This research uses case study methods, including semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and archival research, to understand the concerns, perspectives, and practices around air pollution monitoring and evaluation. It investigates novel questions raised in environmental justice policymaking: What happens when technical ways of knowing do not match the lived experiences of laypersons, particularly in historically disadvantaged communities of color? What are the limitations of current policy infrastructure to grapple with these disconnects? Why do they persist? This approach creates space to investigate connections, patterns, and boundaries between lay knowledge, technical policymaking, and strategies to achieve environmental justice. This research builds on studies of how citizens and policymakers work together to develop regulatory standards and examines what happens when these collectively produced metrics don?t reflect affected residents? concerns. By analyzing debates over credible knowledge in this context, this project will provide insights into how environmental policymaking can take seriously the knowledge claims of affected communities.

The EAFZ is responsible for the M 7.8 and M 7.5 6 February 2023 earthquakes that recently devastated much of southeastern Turkey. These instruments will measure in detail how slow-motion offset along the fault is continuing, weeks to months after the earthquakes - and in the event of future earthquakes, they will measure sudden or gradual offsets across the fault. This information helps seismologists understand how earthquakes occur, estimate the probability of future large earthquakes in the region, and identify parts of the EAFZ that tend to move gradually instead of generating large earthquakes. The PI will be doing this work with Turkish scientists he knows well and has worked with in the past. He and his collaborators will also make needed repairs to extensometers monitoring other dangerous faults in Turkey, so they can send out their data in real time via 5G cellular service.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to install four extensometers along segments of the East Anatolian Fault that were loaded by the 6 February 2023 M 7.8 and M 7.5 earthquakes. The extensometer data, together with seismic and geodetic observations, will provide information about ongoing postseismic creep and stress transfer, which feeds into probabilistic estimates of seismic hazard. These data will also constrain frictional properties of the EAFZ seismogenic zone and provide coseismic and postseismic slip constraints for potential, future EAFZ earthquakes. In addition to installing and telemetering new extensometers, the PI will work with Turkish colleagues to upgrade the telemetry on existing GAGE extensometers along the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) to 5G. Bilham will work closely with Turkish scientists from Istanbul Technical University and Kandilli Observatory, strengthening an existing collaboration and sharing creepmeter design, installation, and interpretation knowledge with students.

Many public schools in rural West Central Illinois are underfunded, have small populations, and are in communities with high poverty rates. This project will serve these partner rural districts by recruiting and preparing STEM teachers for their secondary schools. Scholars will complete STEM curriculum and will benefit from a high-quality teacher preparation program and induction support. They will receive mentoring and advising from both STEM and education faculty, tutoring for subject area exams, and small equipment grants to help build their classroom materials. To facilitate professional development, scholars will have access to a workshop series that focuses on how to teach secondary STEM topics, including how to use pedagogies that enable the scholars to teach these topics in a way that is culturally sensitive and aware. Scholars will also complete a summer seminar that will prepare them to teach in high-need districts and will have the option to complete an undergraduate research experience and/or participate in other pre-service teaching experiences.<br/><br/>This project at Western Illinois University (WIU) includes partnerships with Black Hawk College (BHC) and five local high-need districts (Galesburg, Macomb, Bushnell-Prairie, Fulton County, and Moline-Coal Valley). The project goals are 1) to graduate 24 scholars and place them in local, high-need districts; 2) to grant scholarships to at least six students from BHC; 3) to build a pathway for STEM education majors who graduate from local high schools, start at BHC, finish their degrees at WIU, and teach in local secondary schools; 4) to expand opportunities to introduce early STEM majors to the theory and practice of teaching STEM; and 5) to prepare STEM teachers who are broadly trained in both content and pedagogy and specifically trained to be culturally sensitive and aware. The intellectual merit of the project is to determine the efficacy and impact of all project activities, including participation in seminars and workshops focused on preparation for teaching in high-need districts. The project team will also measure the impact and effectiveness of expanding the existing WIU Learning Assistant program. The broader impacts of the proposed activities include addressing the critical need for well-qualified STEM educators; recruitment activities to attract a diverse candidate pool; and demonstrating the benefits of STEM teaching and the opportunities available in STEM secondary education. Furthermore, expansion of the Learning Assistant program will support all introductory STEM courses at both WIU and BHC. The project includes specific plans for formative and summative evaluation of all activities; dissemination of project results will be made through traditional channels, such as conference presentations and journal articles.

This project aims to both characterize the diversity of these species and understand the interactions between host and symbiont that turned a parasite into a harmless inhabitant. This work will benefit society by advancing understanding of the diversity and contribution of eukaryotic microorganisms to the biosphere, with results that will be disseminated through peer-reviewed literature and presentations for scientific and lay audiences. The research will also be communicated to a broader audience through a workshop for professional scientific journalists. In addition, research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students will train the next generation of integrative systematic biologists.<br/><br/>This PurSUiT project will untangle the various biological entities that make up the Nephromyces community, across six species of tunicate hosts. Next-generation DNA sequencing will be used to determine the diversity of the community, then employ single cell isolation techniques to capture, image and describe individual Nephromyces species and their bacterial endosymbionts. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization labels, the different life stages of each species will be collected and photo-documented for the full life history. At least ten Nephromyces species from each of the six tunicate species will be formally named, as well as their bacterial endosymbionts to the extent possible under the evolving prokaryotic Code of Nomenclature.

For example, emerging brain-machine interfaces built on the large-scale neural recording can decipher brain activities; the decoded information can then be used to control neural prosthetics to restore lost sensory or motor functions for paralyzed patients. On the neural stimulation side, deep brain stimulation has proven to be highly effective in treating certain brain disorders by injecting a pulsed current with a pre-defined pattern. Although these results are highly encouraging, to fully unlock the potential of neural interfaces for future widespread and standard-of-care human clinical use, new device capabilities need to be developed with significantly improved hardware performance. For invasive neural interfaces, the biggest challenge now is to increase the number of simultaneous recording channels to enable control of more sophisticated prosthetics with higher degrees of freedom. For non-invasive neural interfaces, an emerging need is to develop new stimulation techniques that can replace today?s invasive deep brain stimulations to ensure long-term safety in brain disorder treatment. This project aims to address the above two pressing needs by developing a high-channel-count implanted neural interface and a non-invasive high-focality deep brain stimulation system. Through its coherent educational and outreach plan, this project will also train the next-generation workforce in hardware engineering by engaging graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students in STEM. <br/><br/>There are two research thrusts in this project. The first thrust will develop a fully packaged implanted neural interface with higher channel counts of more than ten times of the state of the art. Additionally, the hardware will enable full spectrum coverage to record both local field potentials and action potentials with programmable stimulation capability. The complete hardware module will include a low-power application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that can record, stimulate, digitize, and stream out high-throughput neural signals, a flexible intracortical neural probe that will be flip-chip packaged with the ASIC, and a high-speed digital backend that relays the data from the ASIC to a computer for real-time data processing. The second thrust will develop a non-invasive deep brain stimulation system based on temporally interfering EM waves. The research tasks include multi-physics modeling, stimulation hardware implementation, and validation using phantom and animal model. Overall, this research will have the opportunity to impact the key designs in future brain-machine interfaces, neural prostheses, and the treatment of brain disorders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Encryption is rarely used within managed networks administered by a single organization, like a business, a hospital, or a school. This is because current approaches to network management don't work if traffic is encrypted. The project?s novelties are applications of cryptography that enable network management directly on encrypted traffic. The project?s broader significance is that it will allow creating more secure and privacy-respecting managed networks.<br/><br/> <br/>The project focuses on three critical areas of incompatibility between encryption and network management: policy enforcement, analytics, and network services. In the policy enforcement thrust, the project team uses zero-knowledge proofs to build network middleware that can enforce network policies, such as content filtering, without directly seeing traffic. In the analytics thrust, the project team is designing network analytics systems that do not rely on databases of plaintext traffic logs but verifiably outsource log storage and queries to endpoints. Finally, in the network services thrust, the project team uses cryptography to limit the metadata network services can learn about network traffic.<br/><br/><br/>The project?s broader impact will be improving the security of managed networks. Since management infrastructure will no longer need to see plaintext traffic, compromising this infrastructure will give an attacker less information about activity on the network.

School districts in South Texas face significant challenges with attracting and retaining high-quality mathematics teachers. The increase in resignations during the COVID-19 pandemic have added to these challenges. Moreover, teacher resignations disproportionately impact high-need, high turnover schools across the country. Thus, there is an immediate need to generate new knowledge for preparing STEM majors as outstanding certified secondary mathematics teachers to increase access to high-quality mathematics teachers and decrease the learning loss resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This project builds on a theory of change that assumes fostering belonging and elevating college and career readiness levels among talented STEM undergraduate majors will positively impact local efforts to increase access to high-quality mathematics teachers. To further these aims this project will provide a formalized induction program and career readiness course to ensure equitable situations for all Noyce Scholars. <br/><br/>This project at Texas A&M International University (89.3% Hispanic) includes partnerships with Laredo Independent School District (LISD, 99.7% Hispanic), United Independent School District (UISD, 99.4% Hispanic), and Laredo College (LC, 97.0% Hispanic). The project plan draws on existing literature on belonging, teacher turnover, teacher residencies, High Impact Practices and Mixed Reality Simulations technologies. Four goals guide the execution of this project. First is to increase the effectiveness of the Future Educator Community for fostering belonging among 50 high-achieving STEM Majors and graduating 37 high-quality mathematics teacher candidates over 5 years. Second is to increase the effectiveness of the math educator preparation curriculum to elevate levels of college readiness among high-achieving STEM Majors and 37 high-quality mathematics teacher candidates. Third is to increase the effectiveness of the enrichment curriculum to elevate levels of career readiness among high-achieving STEM Majors and high-quality mathematics teacher candidates. Fourth, and finally, is to collect, analyze, and disseminate data to assess needs, inform revisions, gauge effectiveness of supports, and reallocate resources to increase their effectiveness. External evaluators will conduct stakeholder interviews and analyze mathematics teacher candidate data to generate findings regarding progress towards these goals. Investigators will use this data to generate new knowledge about preparing STEM Majors as outstanding certified Secondary Mathematics Teachers. They will use this knowledge to reduce local STEM education disparities by: (1) building capacity among partners and partnerships engaging in educator preparation learning communities, (2) increasing participation rates among talented STEM students attending local high turnover campuses, (3) elevating outcomes for 4500 Hispanic learners in local mathematics classrooms; (4) advancing STEM education and educator development at the secondary, post-secondary and early career levels; (5) enhancing evaluation infrastructure and data for informing effective math educator preparation for high-need Hispanic-serving school districts.

This project also broadens the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation project investigates how governments and religious institutions differentially interpret and negotiate asylum. The doctoral student integrates participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and archival research methods to empirically examine: 1) the criteria by which governments evaluate evidence of hardship in asylum applications, 2) the criteria by which religious institutions determine if a rejected asylum-seeker is eligible for sanctuary protections; 3) how rejected asylum-seekers from different religious, national, and ethnic backgrounds navigate sanctuary differently and; 4) how governments and religious institutions come to understand and redefine each other?s authority during sanctuary negotiations. The project contributes to social scientific studies of migration by shifting attention toward intersections between the state and non-state entities as cooperating to define political belonging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These new technologies can also help us address barriers that some people face with today?s technologies ? barriers that we currently do not have good solutions for. This is particularly true for cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, deaf-blindness, blindness and intellectual impairments and other combinations of disabilities. Despite successes, it has become apparent that this work needs a new paradigm. Thus, this workshop aims to gather and engage mainstream and disability leaders and innovators in their fields to: a) Thoroughly explore all visions for the future of the interface; b) Gather all different thoughts, approaches, and paradigms from the best in the international accessibility community; and c) Create both mainstream and accessibility research agendas that can result in solutions for next-next generation interface technologies, to be available when these technologies enter the marketplace instead of five years or more behind them. As a byproduct of the workshop, a special website will be created, capturing all of the presentations, preparatory materials, and the final research agenda.  The impact on society of more accessible product interfaces cannot be easily measured, but with the new estimates of a fifth to a quarter of the population having disabilities, and the increasing reliance on digital interfaces in everything we do, even in developing countries, the impact of more accessible interfaces will be quite significant, both to economies and to quality of life for large sectors of the population.<br/><br/>This workshop will bring together leaders in mainstream human computer interaction and supporting technologies to help predict the future interface, as well as the best minds in accessibility to help imagine new approaches and methods to address these technologies.  The result of just these two activities would be of great value to the field. The creation of both a mainstream technology and an accessibility research agenda will be of even more immediate and long-term use to academic researchers and students, and to developers in companies interested in practical ways to make their future product interfaces accessible. It will also be useful to consumer groups, funding agencies, policy makers, assistive technology developers, and independent researchers and developers in shaping their future work, agendas, and goals. The resulting research agenda is intended to be a living agenda that is updated over time and used by the broad range of stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These biological resources help to advance scientific understanding in many ways, including how species respond to climate change, how species evolve through time, and how diseases of wildlife and people emerge and spread. Additionally, specimens can be used to enhance public education at all levels, and one day can be used to answer questions asked by future generations. The collections of mammals at Kansas State University (KSU) are representative of species occurring through the Great Plains from roughly the last 100 years. However, their current storage conditions are poor and the information associated with them is not usable by science or the public. This project will ensure that 1) all existing specimens are properly stored in secure and stable cases, shelving units and freezers, 2) all of the data is digitized and made publicly available online for multiple uses, and 3) the KSU mammal collection will become an active resource for enhancing both science and education, with capacity for ongoing growth and increasing public use. Many of the existing mammal specimens are associated with the nearby Konza Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) Initiative, and as such the KSU mammal collection will represent a legacy of specimen materials from a multi-decade ecological landscape-scale experimental system. <br/><br/>In the first year, new and secure storage cases and shelves will be purchased, and existing mammal specimens will be re-housed. A subset of specimens representative of Kansas mammal diversity will be designated as a teaching collection for KSU classes, and a separate collection for educational purposes will be developed to be housed at the Konza LTER field station. Data associated with all specimens will include information on species, georeferenced collection localities and dates, body measurements, parasites, frozen tissues, and potentially multiple other kinds of specimen parts. All data will be uploaded to the Arctos online multi-collection database and shared across other active specimen data portals including iDigBio. Curation and processing of back-logged specimens will continue through the duration of the project and will be used as resources for teaching curatorial methods to undergraduate students. The work will employ multiple students and technicians over three years. Student experience through learning the process of curating specimens and associated data will help to develop the next generation of museum-based scientists and educators. The renovated collection will enhance K-12 education and multiple undergraduate classes including a field-based methods course in mammalogy. Associated specimen resources will fuel ongoing and novel research directions by the project PI and graduate students. This project will result in a renovated and expanding publicly searchable, and relational specimen data stream. This project is jointly funded by Capacity: Biological Collections and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have proliferated America?s college campuses, with initial creation costs in the thousands to millions of dollars. While emerging data demonstrate the tremendous impact makerspaces may create in the engineering learning experience especially for learning engineering-relevant skills, data also demonstrate that makerspaces fail to meet aspirations of being open and welcoming spaces for all. Currently, it is difficult to determine the learning impact of a makerspace and to compare different makerspaces structures or makerspaces at different institutions with different populations of students. Drawing upon qualitative research that identified the modes and contents of learning in university makerspaces, this project will create and validate an instrument that measures student learning in makerspaces: the Learning through Making survey Instrument. The Learning through Making Instrument will provide a tool for researchers and educators to assess the educational value of makerspaces, compare across different environments, experiment with different approaches, document the learning impacts, and ultimately facilitate understanding how makerspaces can enhance engineering education. This instrument will assist educators in understanding learning gaps that may be associated with obstacles for students providing educators with data critical for designing more makerspaces and associated curriculum that broaden participation and cultivate more accessible and welcoming learning communities. The Learning through Making Instrument will be developed and validated for collegiate students providing a springboard for quantitative research on learning in makerspaces and will facilitate future development of similar instruments applicable for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The research objective is to develop a survey for measuring learning in university makerspaces and similar environments. The proposal team?s prior work, The Learning through Making Typology will be a partial basis for development of the Learning through Making Instrument. Data for instrument development and validations with diverse engineering students will occur at very different universities, including San Jose State, Texas State, Texas A&M, Purdue University, Georgia Tech, and James Madison University. The selection includes two Hispanic-Serving Institutions in two different regions of the country; a comprehensive, mid-Atlantic, regional, undergraduate-focused university offering only a general engineering degree; research-focused universities; and a top school for graduating Black and women engineers that also has dual-degree programs providing access to students from HBCUs. These universities also provide a contrasting set of makerspaces. An initial pool of items will be generated, experts will evaluate the pool of items, and evidence of reliability along with structural validity will be sought by exploratory factor analysis and then confirmatory factor analysis. Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing indicate that fairness of assessments is just as crucial as validity and reliability, and fairness will be evaluated as a key part of this research. We seek to answer the following Research Questions: To what extent are measurement construct specifications and actual assessment questions aligned? To what extent are there measurement invariances between different groups of students? Are there significant differences in the mean scores between groups that indicate certain groups are learning differently in makerspaces?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, existing trait databases are not representative of the geographic and functional diversity within most taxonomic groups. This is especially true for soft tissue structures related to diet and energy balance in mammals. This BRC-BIO project takes a field- and laboratory-based approach to advance knowledge of gastrointestinal (GI) tract variation in small-bodied mammals inhabiting seasonal environments of the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. The award funds seasonal field collections of small mammals at three National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites, generation of a comprehensive suite of phenotypic measurements from the GI tract, and new dietary analyses that will establish understanding of how these species optimize nutrient acquisition from food resources that vary seasonally, in support of survival and reproduction. The project will build important research and training capacity for the PI, and achieve broader impact by creating unique training opportunities in fieldwork and biodiversity data analysis for a racially and culturally diverse group of undergraduate students, as well as by facilitating new GI-themed community outreach events. <br/><br/>Organismal responses to global change are mediated by interactions between phenotypic traits and the environments in which populations occur. Accurately predicting these responses requires individual level measurements of traits whose form-function relationships are well-understood. The purpose of this BRC-BIO project is to advance knowledge of gastrointestinal (GI) tract form, function, and plasticity in small mammals inhabiting seasonal environments. The GI tract is a key organ system tasked with optimizing energetic balance around seasonally-dynamic resource bases. However, knowledge of how and why GI morphology varies in wild populations and in relation to diet and energy requirements remains fragmentary. This project will generate new, high-resolution data on small mammal diet and link these with macro- and microscopic GI proxies to establish robust form-function relationships and illuminate pathways of mammalian response to changing resource availability. These relationships will be explored within and among three species over space (multiple NEON sites in the Appalachian Mountains) and time (3 years and all seasons). The project will allow the PI to build critical research capacity by expanding inquiry of soft tissue functional traits and integrating museum specimens with multiple NEON data streams. It will also establish a biodiversity data literacy course and lab training opportunities that will engage diverse undergraduates in authentic research and field experiences and expedite their recruitment into STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This single cell divides a few times to form a blastocyst composed of about 100 identical cells, but then a so-called cell fate decision is made:  some blastocyst cells will develop into the embryo, and the others will develop into the placenta, which nourishes the developing embryo.  A long-standing question in developmental biology is ?What factors in the early blastocyst trigger cell-fate decision-making??  This project will explore the hypothesis that the energy-producing factories of cells, called mitochondria, guide cell-fate decisions by acting as shuttles for the delivery of factors that drive alternate cell fates.  New technology will be applied to compare mitochondrial features--such as size, energy profiles, and protein makeup--in mouse embryo versus placental cells.  The results are expected to shed light on key steps of cell-fate decision-making and uncover a previously unknown role for mitochondria in this process.  During this research, undergraduate and graduate students will participate in innovative training activities using state-of-the-art scientific tools to forge new discoveries in biology and technology, geared towards development of a deeper understanding of how cell fate is regulated. The project also will implement an innovative team-mentorship strategy to expand opportunities for undergraduate students interested in pursuing Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM)-based careers to engage in research.<br/><br/>Deciphering the core mechanisms that direct cell fate remains a high-priority research area in organ development, function, aging, and disease.  The first cell fate decision in mammals, which drives formation of the inner cell mass (destined to become the embryo) and the trophectoderm (TE; destined to become the placenta), occurs during the later stages of preimplantation embryogenesis.  Although several models have been offered to explain how this process is orchestrated, the identity of the actual initiating driver(s) of embryonic cell lineage specification remains unknown.  One of the earliest fate-determination signals identified thus far is TEA Domain transcription factor 4 (Tead4), which activates transcription of genes required for TE identity.  Supporting its critical role in cell fate specification, disruption of the Tead4 gene in mice generates morulae that fail to generate TE, resulting in embryonic lethality.  With Tead4 being identified as one of the, if not the, earliest signal(s) in embryonic cell fate decision-making, it remains unclear how Tead4 function is restricted only to those cells destined to form the TE.  This project will combine a technological advancement in mitochondrial subpopulation analysis with a mitochondrial lineage-tracing approach to test the hypothesis that differential allocation of mitochondrial subtypes, which differ in their biochemical properties as well as in their proteomic landscapes--including Tead4 internalization--during embryonic development drives cell lineage fate determination.  By testing the significance of mitochondrial subtype heterogeneity and inter-organelle communication to TE versus ICM specification, this project will assess if mitochondrial heterogeneity guides cell fate determination, perhaps through an as-yet undiscovered role for mitochondria as transcription factor ?shuttles? during asymmetric cell divisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to create a conducive environment for collaborations between these different communities of mathematicians. The participation of early career US mathematicians in a major conference like this will help maintain and enhance the leading position of the US in mathematical science research in the relevant areas. The principal investigators and organizing committee will make a concerted effort to identify and support participants from under-represented groups in mathematics.

This conference will also disseminate knowledge to the broader mathematical community as the organizers plan to record all the talks and put the recordings on the internet.<br/><br/>In recent years, there have been strong interactions between questions in geometric analysis and low dimensional topology/geometric group theory. On one hand, questions and examples from low dimensional topology and geometric group theory have inspired rapid development in geometric analysis. On the other hand, analytic methods have been used to prove deep theorems in low dimensional topology and geometric group theory. There are several emerging new connections between these fields, like the recent work of Kleiner-Muller-Xie where they used ideas from the analytical side of geometric mapping theory to study rigidity and regularity of quasiconformal maps between certain spaces and groups, work of Kleiner-Lang where they used metric currents in geometric measure theory to study the large scale geometry of high rank analogues of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, work of Song on the spherical Plateau problem on group homology which connects a geometric variational problem with algebraic and topological properties of groups, etc. The goal of the conference is to bring together experts from these various different fields to exchange views and collaborate on important questions in these fields.

It is the main annual event for the Quality and Productivity Section of the American Statistical Association, and it will consider data science and statistics related topics though presentations, poster sessions, a technical tour, and a one-day short course. Because billions of data sets are collected, processed, and analyzed on a daily basis in virtually every environment known, with an increasing number of data-based decisions being made that have real-world consequences for individuals and society, the data science and statistics community must keep pace with the rapid growth and variety of collected data and provide up-to-date methodologies and guidance to every applied field that utilizes data. QPRC aims to support knowledge sharing regarding data science and statistics to enable researchers and practitioners to understand the impact of data-based systems and decisions, and avoid, or at least detect and mitigate, unintended adverse consequences. It will provide a unique opportunity for attendees to meet, exchange ideas and experiences, and form collaborations. Through participation in QPRC students will gain access to invaluable learning experiences and networking opportunities with other conference attendees.<br/> <br/>The conference theme is ?Statistics, Deep Learning & the People Side of Process,? and it will include 18 invited paper sessions, four to six contributed sessions, poster sessions, a technical tour, and a one-day short course (on June 5). QPRC has the potential to advance knowledge and understanding of topics related to data science and statistics by providing a unique opportunity for statisticians, data scientists, quantitative analysts, researchers, and practitioners to discuss the current progress made in computer-intensive fields such as machine learning, facial recognition, and so forth, and exchange novel ideas and experiences in working with modern big data. Hence, this conference has the potential to 1) disseminate new methods and data-driven approaches, the evaluation of previous findings, and the validation of theoretical approaches, 2) stimulate further investigations regarding the benefits of working with big, multidimensional data, both structured and unstructured, and 3) increase the awareness of the need to use big data ethically and to address the bias that may result from the automated collection and analysis of large datasets. In addition, QPRC has the potential to benefit society in several ways. First, it provides the opportunity for attendees to learn and reframe their understanding of concepts related to data science and statistics. Second, QPRC will promote the responsible deployment and interpretation of data science and statistical methods in a variety of applied areas. Third, to disseminate the knowledge from the conference to the broader community, QPRC presenters will be invited to submit their work for publication in a special issue of the Journal of Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry. Fourth, to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (i.e., women, racial/ethnic minorities, etc.) in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, funding is requested to support graduate students especially those in underrepresented groups from U.S. institutions to participate in QPRC.

Autonomous robotic systems, such as self-driving cars and drones, are shaping the nation's future insofar as the transportation, logistics, and service segments of the economy are concerned. Artificial neural networks have become an indispensable component of modern autonomous systems, especially in their perception and control pipelines. However, neural networks are complex, difficult to analyze, and sensitive to input perturbations or adversarial attacks. This renders their rigorous analysis and design very challenging. Thus, despite the continued optimism and tremendous technological progress in recent years, truly autonomous systems remain elusive because of outstanding safety and reliability concerns. This project overcomes these concerns by establishing a rigorous methodological framework and efficient algorithms for the analysis, verification, motion planning, and control design of safety-critical dynamic systems with learning-enabled components. It demonstrates how this framework enables provable performance guarantees for safe and reliable operation. Through close integration of research, education, and outreach, the project aims to leverage knowledge discovery to stimulate teaching and learning, use inspired teaching to encourage excitement in research, and make newly generated knowledge accessible to the public. This is accomplished through active learning-based design of a course on safety control in robotics, by engaging students from underrepresented groups in research and organizing K-12 summer workshops with hands-on robotics activities, and by increasing public literacy, awareness, and trust in safety-related technologies for autonomous systems.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop the foundations of a mathematically rigorous framework for the multi-rate and provably safe motion planning and control of autonomous systems with neural network components. It achieves this aim by investigating constrained zonotope- and hybrid zonotope-based algorithms for computing over-approximated reachable sets for neural feedback systems with a tunable trade-off between computational efficiency and approximation accuracy; robust quadratic program-based methods for designing provably safe, periodic event-triggered tracking controllers; second-order cone program-based trajectory planning methods for neural feedback systems with continuous-time safety guarantees; and provably safe multi-rate planning and control algorithms with an assume-guarantee contract between the planning and tracking layers. Verification and validation of the theoretical results will be performed using high-fidelity vehicle dynamics software simulations and with physical experiments on two lab-based robotic platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using elicited and spontaneous language production, the effects of implicit and explicit langauge attitudes are also analyzed. Languages that are in sustained contact often experience language change that is the result of one language on the other. These transfer effects may occur for grammatical features that are present in one language but absent in the other. This difference may give rise to the increased use of non-standard forms as compared to non-contact varieties of the same langauge. This research contributes to the understanding and description of non-standard language use in a large scale analysis that systematically investigates language use across levels of education, bilingual profiles, generations, and location. By examining such non-standard language use, this research contributes important empirical data on whether smaller minority languages can have transfer effects on a majority language. <br/><br/>Prior observations on non-standard language use in contact settings have traditionally related non-standard forms to lower levels of education. This project tests this claim by investigating age, native language, language of schooling, level of education, as well as linguistic contexts. To investigate non-standard forms, speakers engage in a 45-minute-long semi-structured sociolinguistic interview. Participants? implicit attitudes towards non-standard agreement are examined in an experimental task where they hear standard and non-standard forms, while rating what they hear. Explicit language attitudes are measured by participants' response to two explicit questions on their attitudes towards non-standard language use. The data obtained from this research provides a rich data set with comprehensive information on the social and linguistic factors that influence non-standard language variants, as well as the influence of language attitudes on production. This research contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying language change in contact scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the general conditions responsible for the process are understood, recent observations have demonstrated that blowing snow and blizzard conditions can vary significantly in time and space.  Forecasting these events is difficult; weather models do not include the process, meaning that forecasters are reliant on imperfect techniques to predict the hazard.  Further, it is believed that blowing snow can modify the lower atmosphere suggesting that additional downstream errors in forecasts are possible. Besides these immediate impacts on society, blowing snow is a critical process in open, cold regions of the globe by impacting the distribution of water and energy at the Earth?s surface. Innovative observations are needed to better understand blowing snow and provide the ground truth needed to advance efforts to model the process.  <br/><br/>This collaborative project seeks to understand the physical mechanisms and impacts of blowing snow in the Northern Great Plains. The project will investigate the microphysical structure of blowing snow layers and the roles that terrain, atmospheric state, and sublimation have on the evolution of these events. Innovative observations will be made in and around eastern North Dakota/northwestern Minnesota, a region prone to blizzards and blowing snow events. The project will continue development of affordable, ground-based and balloon-borne microphysical imagers. Collectively with traditional radiosondes and vertically pointing lidars, observations will be used to evaluate and improve a fully coupled blowing snow parameterization within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and the improved model will be applied to identify the key aspects determining blowing snow behavior. Multiple graduate students and numerous undergraduate students will be impacted through field work, analysis of data, numerical modeling, and deployment of hydrometeor imagers to other academic institutions. The project will promote other public outreach efforts and includes partners such as state tribal colleges and the National Weather Service, ensuring dissemination of knowledge to diverse groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Measuring Earth surface deformation is fundamental to detect and analyze surface and subsurface changes due to anthropogenic activity, with a myriad of industrial applications that includes the monitoring of oil and gas extraction fields and storage reservoirs, mining operations, carbon dioxide sequestration, and/or infrastructure integrity. Illustrating the economic and social impact of its uses, the market for analyzing Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data is expected to double within 5 years. Beyond the dramatic economic growth of InSAR, its far-ranging applications have broad social and scientific impacts, in particular related to natural hazards and climate change.  Advances in InSAR processing and improved signal-to-noise ratios will translate into improved monitoring of earthquake activity, landslides, water supplies, deforestation, floods, ice sheets, etc.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at tackling the lack of automation in InSAR processing and improving detection thresholds in InSAR time series analysis. While the technique can potentially measure millimeter-scale changes in deformation over periods of days to years, atmospheric effects can wreak havoc on repeat-pass InSAR interpretation by introducing errors that may mask small surface deformations. These effects, which are fundamentally due to pressure, temperature and relative humidity variations in the troposphere, can lead to errors that are larger than most of the deformation signals of interest. Current algorithms are not suited for automated, large-scale monitoring without a priori data because they require time-consuming manual intervention, and the final product requires exhaustive expert interpretation. Through the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods this project aims at: (i) further automating and accelerating the processing of InSAR time series, via the automation of some key sections of the processing pipeline that still rely on extensive and costly human intervention; and (ii) developing a new methodology to generate InSAR time series, that is robust to noise and allows for a finer temporal and spatial resolution compared to the state-of-the-art.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The iSIM will foster scientific discussion and catalyze innovation and partnerships to significantly enhance our understanding of the challenges and potential solutions to integrating magnetic materials on Si substrates and PCBs (print circuit boards). The iSIM-1, and the future annual iSIM symposiums, will call attention to the IEEE Magnetics Society and the public on the topics of integrated magnetics. Integrated magnetics is a key topic for semiconductor technologies, well aligned with The CHIPS and Science Act, a national strategic and historic investment to surge production of American-made semiconductors, tackle supply chain vulnerabilities to make more goods in America, revitalize America?s scientific research and technological leadership, and strengthens America?s economic and national security at home and abroad. <br/><br/>Magnetic materials on Si and on PCBs, if realized, can lead to magnetic inductors and transformers on-chip or in package with significantly reduced sizes and costs, and improved performance.  Despite the significant progress of research on magnetic materials and devices, integrated magnetic inductors and transformers have not been applied on commercial RFICs (radio frequency integrated circuits), and rarely on power integrated circuits. Surface mount discrete components are widely used in power management circuits and RFICs, leading to significant costs and sizes, etc. There is a critical need for a symposium on integrated magnetics such as iSIM. The proposed iSIM-1 will be the first satellite symposium being organized for May 14-15, 2023, in conjunction with the IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG) 2023 in Sendai, Japan, being held from May 15 ~ 19, 2023. INTERMAG is the premier international conference on fundamental and applied magnetism but has limited bandwidth to cover topics on integrated magnetics. The iSIM-1 will be at the same venue as the INTERMAG 2023, with focused coverage on topics for integrated magnetics for power supply on chip (PWRSOC), power supply in package (PWRSIP), RFICs, on-chip magnetic sensors, flexible magnetic electronics, magnetic memory, etc. It is expected that the iSIM will be held continuously every year as a satellite symposium of the future INTERMAG conferences. A key output of iSIM-1 will be high-impact, multi-disciplinary position papers with direct implications for integrated magnetics. The iSIM-1 will foster discussion and identify innovations for the next frontier of magnetic materials and devices for integrated circuits, on-chip magnetic sensors, flexible magnetic electronics, magnetic memory, etc. At the same time, iSIM-1 will provide ample training opportunities for U.S. nationals with a focus on underrepresented groups, including women and minority students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More specifically, the substrate an organism interacts with can pose various challenges during locomotor movements that can impact performance. Adaptations in movement require a dynamic interplay between an organisms? nervous system, anatomy, and muscle physiology, which together drive whole-body movements. However, the physiological strategies that one animal uses may not be ideally suited for a different habitat or substrate type. This research aims to understand how specialized ways of movement, more specifically, how hopping and jumping may constrain how an organism responds to instantaneous changes in the environment. Frogs and toads provide a unique model to understand variation in movement strategies. This project will investigate whole-body movement and nervous system control of muscle recruitment in response to changes in substrate stiffness. In addition, the project will investigate the mechanics and organization of tendon tissue to better understand the role of tendon stiffness in specialized forms of movement. Such unique adaptations in muscle and tendon physiology can inform the impacts of changing environments across habitats on locomotion, as well as design parameters in engineered systems dealing with environmental disturbance. The broader impacts of this research will increase research opportunities and mentorship of undergraduate students historically underrepresented in STEM, as well as enable the development of educational workshop-based trainings and resources to increase access to STEM research opportunities across the home institution. <br/><br/>Throughout history the emergence of new modes of locomotion has played a crucial role in an animal?s ability to navigate new habitats. For example, behavioral transitions between microhabitats may result in more subtle shifts in an animal?s locomotor strategy. In some cases, the locomotor system may be flexible enough to accommodate changes in the physical properties of the environment. The proposed work aims to understand how specialized ways of movement have uniquely constrained motor control strategies and muscle-tendon properties. To address this, the first aim will quantify and compare interspecific kinematic variation between the long distance, endurance hopping of Cane toads, and the fast, powerful jumps of Cuban tree frogs, in response to environmental perturbations in substrate stiffness. The second aim measures in vivo hindlimb muscle length and motor patterns in response to substrate stiffness to characterize the motor control mechanisms used by long distance endurance hoppers. The third aim seeks to characterize tendon ultrastructure by quantifying collagen fibril organization using techniques in transmission electron microscopy and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy. Lastly, tendon material properties will be quantified using in vitro tendon tissue stress and strain tests to determine the role of tissue stiffness across species specialized for differing modes of locomotion and power output. The proposed research will advance understanding of how specialization in different locomotor modes can provide robust benefits or limitations at various levels of physiological organization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will broadly impact the field of systems and synthetic biology by developing synthetic approaches to precisely modulate gene expression noise. <br/><br/>The overall objective of this research is to systematically alter gene expression noise following activation of inflammatory signaling and demonstrate how it impacts collective cell activation of the inflammatory response in innate immune cells. The central hypothesis to be tested is that the chromatin environment at the promoter and RNA polymerase II regulation are major determinants of gene expression noise. These processes can be synthetically targeted to rationally alter cell-to-cell variability during transcription to change cell-population responses. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that a promoter?s permissiveness for transcription affects transcriptional noise. To achieve the objectives of this research, CRISPR-Cas9 technology will be used to recruit epigenetic regulators to target promoters to alter gene expression noise. A mathematical model will also be developed to predict how specific molecular steps in transcription modulate noise.

The project will provide community researchers with well-designed and usable web interfaces for requesting the deployment of customized sensing experiments and for accessing carefully curated datasets from past experiments and trials. The project will also conduct periodic community outreach and engagement activities, including workshops to promote the testbed?s use and share the outcomes of research activities enabled by the testbed data. <br/><br/>ScooterLab vehicles, besides providing a convenient, electric option to its participants, will serve as excellent instruments to crowd-sense fine-grained, multi-sensor scientific data, enabling new research breakthroughs in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and other interdisciplinary domains. By empowering NSF CISE and other research communities to openly access these scientific datasets, the ScooterLab testbed will engender transformative advancements. Successful development and deployment of ScooterLab will transform micromobility-related and micromobility-supported research at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), the University of Oklahoma (OU), and other collaborating organizations and institutes of higher education. ScooterLab will improve opportunities nationally for attracting and sustaining CISE, engineering, urban planning, and policy faculty and students working on emerging intelligent transportation and mobility solutions. The ScooterLab testbed will also serve as a foundational research instrument for UTSA?s recently launched School of Data Science located in downtown San Antonio, and contribute to the university?s initiatives to reduce its carbon emissions. As a Minority-Serving Institution (59% Hispanic and 53% Female), UTSA will provide extensive research and participation opportunities for people of color and women.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project awarded to a CAREER scholar has the goal to increase our understanding of effective faculty mentoring and its connection to STEM graduate student ?thriving?, defined in terms of engagement and achievement.  This project integrates research and education with graduate traineeships, annual training workshops, and the dissemination of research.  Besides developing training materials for faculty, the educational activities include training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.  This award is supported by the EHR Core Research program which supports fundamental STEM Education research initiatives. <br/><br/>The work will apply a framework based on the psychological theory of social support to understand the role of faculty mentorship in student outcomes.  Within this theoretical construct, the impact of social identity is linked to the student?s perception of the mentor?s belief in the student?s potential as well as the student?s perception of support provided by the mentor. These appraisals by the student can contribute to ?thriving? as measured by objective outcomes (e.g. passing requirements, publications) and subjective experiences (e.g. motivation, stress). The study will examine: what aspects of faculty mentorship are perceived by doctoral students to impact their success; the role of perceived and observed faculty support; and, what types of behavior by a faculty mentor impact the student?s perception.  In-person workshops will serve as the basis for the development of an online training module on effective mentoring by STEM faculty.  The results of this project will expand knowledge of the impact of mentorship on preparing graduate students and reducing attrition rates by increasing our understanding of how faculty mentors can impact the success of students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prior studies have indicated that course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) and other forms of active learning led to deeper understanding of scientific topics, improved retention in science careers, and other positive outcomes for students. However, active learning and CUREs are challenging to scale, and the latter usually require access to lab facilities and materials which are often inequitably distributed. To address these challenges, this project will develop active learning-based and CURE curriculum units that use free, online open data and tools from the Allen Institute. In addition, the project team will develop a standardized concept inventory for measuring student understanding of mitosis, investigate the impacts of those curricula on student learning outcomes using the concept inventory, and ultimately release both the teaching tools as well as the research results. The key innovations of this project will be a) to advance understanding of the impacts of open data as a teaching tool on student attitudes and knowledge, b) to create and release validated open-data-based lessons, and c) to develop and release a validated concept inventory (CI) on mitosis, a tool used to capture student understanding of core concepts on a topic. If use of open data for active learning or a full virtual CURE generates significant learning and attitude benefits for students, this indicates that open data may be used in teaching settings to lower some of the social and economic barriers to entry and retention in scientific research and increase access to impactful experiences in the field. The findings from this study would inform teaching across topics on the impact of open data on student scientific thinking, engagement with learning, retention of knowledge, and persistence in the field.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to systematically evaluate the impact of using open data and research tools in a classroom setting on student understanding, scientific thinking, confidence, and attitudes, specifically in the context of learning the biological process of mitosis. The open data and tools used in this project have been previously produced by the Allen Institute for Cell Science, a division of the Allen Institute, and include thousands of high-resolution, fluorescently-tagged 3D images of live human cells with accompanying visualization and quantitative analysis tools. This study would extend the validated use cases and impact of these open resources into the world of education. This project will produce two primary products: a) two curricula on mitosis using open data for active learning or for a CURE, which will also be released as open educational resources (OERs) at the end of the study, and b) a validated CI on mitosis. These products will be used to quantify the impact of these variant curricula on students? scientific thinking skills, knowledge of mitosis (measured with the CI), confidence in their own knowledge, interest in continuing study, and other attitudinal outcomes. This study aims to extend the benefits of CUREs to settings where a laboratory-based option is not available, and to provide new tools and options to educators interested in implementing CUREs. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

An environment rich in protons can change the charge on proteins in cells if the proteins have amino acids that are ionizable. Changes to charge states of proteins that arise from the association or dissociation of protons can control how proteins in cells respond to specific types of signals such as environmental factors that induce changes to salt or proton concentrations. Research in this project will leverage new methods to study how specific proteins, known as intrinsically disordered proteins, are modified by the uptake or release of protons based on the acidity of the solution. Studies carried out as part of the project will lead to an improved understanding of how alterations to charge states of proteins influence their functions. This work is important because charge-mediated interactions are central to a variety of protein functions including the recognition of one protein by another. Given the unique nature of the technological advances that are driving research in the project, there will be novel training opportunities at the intersection of computation and experiment in the broad area of molecular biophysics. Findings from the project will be incorporated into materials of courses for undergraduates. Further, key personnel who are involved in the project will work closely with students from inner city middle and high-schools to explain how pH and a better understanding of acid-base equilibria will drive new research frontiers that emerge from the project. The blend of computation and experiment, driven in part by the development of novel computational tools, including machine learning modules, will create new workflows for solving challenging problems in molecular biophysics. These modules will be incorporated into instructional modules for research trainees and students in molecular biophysics.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to understand how the exchange of protons between ionizable residues and the accumulation of solution ions around these residues contribute to the charge states and conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Currently, our understanding of the form, functions, and phase behaviors of IDPs is limited by the simplifying assumption that charge states of ionizable residues are fixed by the pKa values of model compounds. The proposed work rests on the principle that conformational fluctuations engender changes to local microenvironments of ionizable residues. These local heterogeneities can induce exchange of protons among titratable sites. This can also induce preferential accumulation of solution ions around ionizable residues. A key advance that drives the investigations is the recent development of the q-canonical ensemble, which is a formal and rigorous statistical physics-based description of the joint effects of charge state and conformational heterogeneity. Importantly, an integrated experimental and computational pipeline has been developed and this allows one to leverage the structure of the q-canonical ensemble to quantify the effects of proton association or dissociation, known as charge regulation, and its interplay with the effects of solution ions through charge renormalization. Approaches that rest on the formal decoupling between measurements of charge and conformation, will allow for the incorporation of information derived from potentiometric titrations and measurements of conformational or phase equilibria into simulations. This, when anchored by experimental data, will lead to a full description of the ensemble of charge state and conformations that are accessible at different solution conditions. The approaches are novel, the focus is unique, and the insights to be generated from the project are likely to be unprecedented.

The Arctic is one of the fastest warming regions of the planet and long-term observations have revealed that natural systems in this region are undergoing substantial changes. Observed changes have been especially pronounced in the Pacific Arctic, where increases in ocean temperature, decreases in sea ice extent, and changes in currents have been observed alongside changes in the composition of ecologically important biological communities that live in sediments on the seafloor. Changes in these communities likely will have cascading impacts on fisheries and seabird and marine mammal populations that rely on food from the seafloor. The goal of this project is to examine coincident changes in seafloor biological communities and physical environments as recorded in samples collected over the last several decades to understand relationships between environmental change and ecological responses in the Pacific Arctic. In particular, this project will test how well observational data collected annually for decades can be used to make forecasts of how marine systems are likely to change in response to environmental change. A secondary goal is to assess how well ongoing sampling efforts may be able to detect biological changes in these systems. Ecological and environmental changes in the Pacific Arctic also will have immediate economic and social implications, especially for Indigenous communities that rely on subsistence harvests of walruses and bearded seals. By helping to improve our ability to detect, explain, and predict changes in these systems, this project will support effective management and sustainable use of marine resources, while mitigating social impacts on local communities. This project also will combine research and education by providing interdisciplinary training in polar biology, modeling, statistics, and data science to students at all levels and from backgrounds that are historically underrepresented in these fields, including interns from rural Appalachia, undergraduates, and an early career scientist. Lastly, we will share research outcomes and acquire shared knowledge from Indigenous communities in the region.<br/><br/><br/>2. Biological communities found in seafloor sediments of the Pacific Arctic are highly productive, influence ecosystem processes, and are critical food resources for marine mammals and birds. These seafloor communities are also sensitive to environmental change, and recent observations indicate shifts in taxonomic composition associated with increases in ocean temperature, decreases in sea ice extent, and changes in currents. Changes in Pacific Arctic seafloor communities are likely to have cascading impacts on seabird and marine mammal populations, ecosystem function, and fisheries. However, improving our ability to explain and predict responses of Arctic marine systems to rapid climate change remains a substantial challenge. In remote, data-limited ecosystems like the Arctic seafloor, where direct observation and experimentation are difficult, correlative models are often used to link biological patterns to environmental gradients and to make forecasts of ecosystem trajectories. However, few studies have performed rigorous tests of the ability of these so-called ?space-for-time substitution? approaches to predict changes in community composition, in large part due to a lack of contemporary datasets with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage. At the same time, we lack a basic understanding of the role of thresholds, where incremental changes in the physical environment result in sudden and fundamental changes to community composition and ecosystem function, in driving biological responses to environmental change. To address these hurdles, this project will (1) analyze multi-decadal time series of paired biological and physical observations that have been collected in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas since the 1980s to characterize relationships between the physical environment and responses of ecologically important marine seafloor communities; (2) test the extent to which observational time series can inform forecasts of changes in these systems; and (3) evaluate the efficiency of ongoing sampling efforts to detect biological changes. In doing so, this project will improve our ability to explain, detect, and predict biological responses in changing Arctic environments and address associated knowledge gaps using novel modeling methods. The Arctic is one of the most rapidly warming regions on the planet and associated impacts on high biomass seafloor communities in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas will have immediate economic and social implications for potential northward fisheries expansion as well as co-management of subsistence harvests of walruses and bearded seals by Indigenous communities. Our goal is to improve our ability to detect, explain, and predict changes in these systems, and in doing so we will support effective management and sustainable use of marine resources, while mitigating social impacts on local communities. In addition, we will integrate research and education in multiple ways by: (i) mentoring summer interns from underrepresented groups attending a local college in rural Appalachia; (ii) providing research experiences to undergraduates through an existing Research Experiences for Undergraduates program; and (iii) training of a graduate student in spatial modeling, marine science, and global change ecology. These programs will provide interdisciplinary training that spans polar biology, spatial modeling, statistics, and data science for students from backgrounds that are historically underrepresented in these fields. Lastly, we will share research outcomes and acquire shared knowledge from Indigenous communities in the Bering Strait region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this context, cyber honeypots have been shown to be highly valuable tools for collecting data to better understand the many different strategies and objectives of the attackers. The project?s novelty is to develop a new domain-specific stealthy honeypot for cyber-physical critical infrastructures and specifically PLC controllers.

The project's broader significance and importance are to provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners looking to incorporate honeypots and security methods into cyber-physical systems (CPS) and embedded controllers. <br/><br/>For complete stealth, the solutions leverage air-gapped observations of the malware behavior through physical side channels such as PLC processor power signal produced by the on-device malicious code execution. For deception, the techniques leverage mathematical models and physics-informed neural networks to provide a realistic emulation of the physical dynamics and a misleading physical process interface to the PLC input-output ports. The research outcomes address the above-mentioned semantic gap via an automated binary reverse engineering of the malicious controller code to extract the high-level adversarial objectives from low-level controller software execution traces.

These two effects are related, because a warmer ocean can melt sea ice faster, and when sea ice melts, more sunlight gets into the ocean, making it even warmer. Melted sea ice may also result in more ocean turbulence as it allows for bigger waves on the ocean surface. We do not fully understand how melting sea ice and a warming ocean influence each other, and it is difficult to make ocean measurements in the Arctic Ocean. Here we propose to use an existing dataset of turbulence observations to understand whether warming of Arctic waters is associated with ocean mixing, to identify regional patterns in mixing, and to quantify changes in recent years. These observations were made with a highly specialized instrument that can directly measure ocean turbulence, which has been infrequently used in the Arctic Ocean. Part of the proposed work is to develop new methods to interpret the data in this unique environment. Once these methods are developed, they may make long term monitoring of changes in Arctic turbulence possible. The motivation driving this work is to improve understanding of how Arctic climate change will affect interactions between the ocean and sea ice. This is an important goal both for Arctic coastal communities, who face a loss of sea ice and increasing coastal erosion, and for improving predictions of global climate. The proposal will support the early careers of two female scientists, and will also support a collaboration with the Birch Aquarium to develop an exhibit to explain Arctic climate change to a broad audience.<br/><br/><br/>Climate change is dramatically altering the Arctic Ocean, including the multidecadal loss of Arctic sea ice. Understanding potential feedbacks between sea ice loss and the warming Arctic Ocean is of critical importance to predicting and mitigating future climate change. Here we propose to use an existing dataset of 264 profiles of shipboard turbulence observations collected on two Arctic Observing Network cruises to <br/>assess the strength of vertical mixing in boundary current regions of the Arctic Ocean, and quantify any correlation between the strength of mixing and temperature of boundary currents (which have warmed in recent years); and <br/>identify regional patterns in mixing along the Arctic shelves and quantify any changes in mixing rates relative to prior studies. <br/>We aim to use the results to both improve our understanding of Arctic ocean mixing in a warming climate and inform future efforts to monitor changes in the Arctic mixing environment. These deployments represent some of the first uses of turbulence instruments in the Arctic ocean which can be routinely deployed on hydrography cruises, and processing and interpreting the resulting data will require new methods due to differences between the Arctic ocean and the lower latitude oceans where these instruments are usually deployed. Once completed, this analysis will provide information about changes in Arctic oceanic vertical mixing and how the vertical transport of heat and nutrients will evolve in a changing climate. The underlying objective of this work is to improve understanding of the Arctic climate and its likely trajectory in terms of vertical mixing rates along the margins. This aim is important regionally, as Arctic coastal communities face a loss of sea ice and coastal erosion, and globally for improving predictions of the future climate.

However, deep neural networks have some known limitations. They usually do not model the underlying physical process (e.g., light transport or dynamics) directly, they require significant computational resources for training and inference, and they are difficult to debug and control. On the other hand, while classical visual computing algorithms that explicitly model the formation of visual data (e.g., how a camera captures a picture or how objects move physically) suffer less from these issues, they often do not apply as broadly as modern machine learning methods because they do not learn from a large amount of experience. This research will bridge the gap between the two approaches by creating classical visual computing algorithms that are differentiable. That is, the functioning of these algorithms depends smoothly on a set of internal parameters that can be tuned automatically using deep learning approaches. The project will optimize these domain-specific differentiable visual computing programs using data to get the best of both worlds. Project outcomes will have broad impact in applications such as enabling self-driving cars to make better decisions, training robots to interact with the environment using physical information, creating more realistic virtual worlds, designing buildings with better lighting, designing physical objects with desired appearance and functionality, and allowing movie artists to create better film shots. The systems developed through this research will be incorporated into new programming courses and tutorials, and the PI is committed to working with early career scholar programs to promote participation in visual computing and differentiable programming.<br/><br/>This project pursues a synergistic plan that includes the design of differentiable programming systems, algorithms, and applications. To these ends, it will be necessary to adapt domain-specific algorithms and compute their derivatives in correct and efficient manners, to design new visual computing algorithms that leverage both data-driven priors and domain-specific knowledge, and to parameterize the problem for optimization to avoid local minima and satisfy constraints. Neither traditional automatic differentiation nor modern deep learning systems address these challenges. The algorithms, systems, and applications will evolve together to help each other. Concretely, this project will develop differentiable programming languages that can properly handle discontinuities, and automatically optimize code performance to efficiently process millions or billions of pixels, particles, or triangles by exploiting structured sparsity in visual computing programs. It will also develop new domain-specific differentiable visual computing algorithms with improved efficiency and accuracy in image processing and physical simulation, by retaining the structures of classical algorithms while replacing hand-built heuristic components of the algorithm with data-driven elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One key roadblock is the inability of wearables to sense behavior-relevant information such as limb posture (for both hands and feet) or fine-grained details such as facial expressions. This project will enable the next generation of wearables to continuously track and interpret a key set of fine-grained body postures (e.g., face, hands, limbs, eyes, tongue) in daily life using low-power, low-cost, and privacy-sensitive intelligent acoustic sensing technologies. The project outputs will help researchers and developers monitor and exploit a range of high-resolution data in everyday settings to significantly improve the performance of downstream applications in areas with positive societal impact, including accessibility, telemedicine, and activity recognition. As a demonstration, this project will use the new wearables to immediately improve the accessibility of computers for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals as well as people with speech impairments, by advancing American Sign Language (ASL) and Silent Speech recognition.  <br/><br/>To achieve the desired goals, the research will employ an iterative and user-centered design process. First, a list of AI-powered wearables that use acoustic sensing to continuously track fine-grained postures will be developed. These wearables will be evaluated extensively and iteratively in both lab and real-world settings to ensure optimal user experience and performance, and to identify any remaining challenges. Next, the research will address the critical challenges of deploying these data-driven acoustic sensing technologies in everyday settings by using customized signal processing and AI algorithms (such as data simulation and synthesis, data augmentation, and edge computing) to improve the system's generalizability across users and its robustness in the presence of noise, and to minimize training efforts while protecting user privacy. Thirdly, the research will demonstrate how these new wearables can enhance computers' ability to understand complex human behaviors, which will naturally support users in two high-impact downstream applications: ASL and silent speech recognition. Throughout the design, development, and evaluation process, the work will be carried out in collaboration with experts in related fields (including wearable computing, AI, linguistics, and otorhinolaryngology), and with partners in the target community (including persons who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, and those with speech impairments).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Then, the team will iteratively design algorithms that use natural language processing and conversational AI techniques, along with network science and user modeling methods, to suggest conversation partners, topics, and styles that may help people make connections across groups more effectively. These will be tested with a combination of laboratory and field studies to measure the effectiveness of the developed interventions with robust causality and external validity. Together, the project will improve understanding of how technology might help a diverse society such as ours operate more effectively.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Field collections and laboratory experiments using high resolution chemical and physical analyses will be used to assess the influence of surfactant molecular composition and associated properties on the hygroscopic growth of atmospheric particles. Hygroscopic growth can alter particle size and composition, both of which are important determinants in the influence of aerosol particles on visibility and human health.<br/><br/>The effect of surfactants on particle hygroscopic growth is expected to be nonlinear and dependent on the surfactant molecular composition, structure, and critical micelle concentration. The experimental plan will address the following questions: (1) What are the compositions, structures, and interfacial properties of surfactants in atmospheric aerosol particles? How do these surfactant characteristics vary as a function of particle size and air mass source region (e.g., natural, anthropogenic, marine, aged influences)? (2) What effects do surfactant structure, composition, and interfacial properties have on the hygroscopic growth of submicron and supermicron aerosol particles? Chemical and physical measurements of aerosol particles collected as part of two field campaigns at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, on the coast of Georgia, will be made during two seasons to capture seasonal variability. Laboratory experiments will also be conducted to measure the hygroscopic growth of model laboratory-generated aerosol particles to determine the influence of the surfactant fraction directly. Multivariate statistics will be used to determine the surfactant properties in different particle types.<br/><br/>The education and outreach plan includes working with high school students to collect local air quality measurements, developing a new laboratory course to explore the principles of analytical chemistry through measurements of aerosol chemistry, and conducting a first-year research seminar course and a summer research experience for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These two effects are related, because a warmer ocean can melt sea ice faster, and when sea ice melts, more sunlight gets into the ocean, making it even warmer. Melted sea ice may also result in more ocean turbulence as it allows for bigger waves on the ocean surface. We do not fully understand how melting sea ice and a warming ocean influence each other, and it is difficult to make ocean measurements in the Arctic Ocean. Here we propose to use an existing dataset of turbulence observations to understand whether warming of Arctic waters is associated with ocean mixing, to identify regional patterns in mixing, and to quantify changes in recent years. These observations were made with a highly specialized instrument that can directly measure ocean turbulence, which has been infrequently used in the Arctic Ocean. Part of the proposed work is to develop new methods to interpret the data in this unique environment. Once these methods are developed, they may make long term monitoring of changes in Arctic turbulence possible. The motivation driving this work is to improve understanding of how Arctic climate change will affect interactions between the ocean and sea ice. This is an important goal both for Arctic coastal communities, who face a loss of sea ice and increasing coastal erosion, and for improving predictions of global climate. The proposal will support the early careers of two female scientists, and will also support a collaboration with the Birch Aquarium to develop an exhibit to explain Arctic climate change to a broad audience.<br/><br/><br/>Climate change is dramatically altering the Arctic Ocean, including the multidecadal loss of Arctic sea ice.

These deployments represent some of the first uses of turbulence instruments in the Arctic ocean which can be routinely deployed on hydrography cruises, and processing and interpreting the resulting data will require new methods due to differences between the Arctic ocean and the lower latitude oceans where these instruments are usually deployed. Once completed, this analysis will provide information about changes in Arctic oceanic vertical mixing and how the vertical transport of heat and nutrients will evolve in a changing climate. The underlying objective of this work is to improve understanding of the Arctic climate and its likely trajectory in terms of vertical mixing rates along the margins. This aim is important regionally, as Arctic coastal communities face a loss of sea ice and coastal erosion, and globally for improving predictions of the future climate.

In particular, twisting one layer relative to another induces strong interactions between the electrons in them. Modifying the number of electrons in a third nearby layer enables control over the strength of interactions and can change electronic properties such as the distribution of charge at the nanoscale. Furthermore, the reverse process, where the nanoscale charge arrangement imprints a reconfigurable modulation on the third layer, can also lead to exotic quantum behavior. The predicted states may have applications in low-power electronics, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and novel electromagnetic devices.

As with many biological materials, this outstanding behavior is due to a highly complex structure. When studied at increasing magnifications, the endocarp reveals different structures at each magnification level. At the largest level, a porous network can be seen, consisting of bundles of hollow channels. Larger magnifications reveal a graded cellular structure, where larger cells are found toward the inside of the coconut, and smaller cells toward the outside. The cells themselves feature walls consisting of many layers, and each of these layers consists of tiny fibrils. Understanding comprehensively how all of these elements work together to make the coconut so strong and tough is a significant challenge, especially because of their disparity in size. This project will develop novel computer simulation techniques with the capability of treating these different elements simultaneously at the relevant sizes. This project will also develop new experimental techniques to measure and visualize directly how the different elements inside the coconut endocarp interact, to test and calibrate the computer models. This integrated computational and experimental approach will provide unprecedented insights into how the coconut?s structure gives rise to its outstanding performance. These insights and methods can then be used to engineer coconut-inspired lightweight applications that are strong and tough, for instance to improve helmets. This project will provide research opportunities to undergraduate students. For instance, computational and experimental training series will be offered to undergraduate students during the summer. Underrepresented students including female and minority students will participate in this research project. This project will also provide opportunities to students with disabilities to work on computational modeling remotely. Presentations and seminar talks will be offered to middle and high school students to attract them to participate into biomaterial research.   <br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>Coconut endocarp is substantially stronger and stiffer than wood, despite sharing the same major ingredients: cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin. The key to this impressive mechanical performance is a sophisticated structure with many levels of structural hierarchy between the molecular scale and the macroscale. This project?s goal is to develop a rigorous understanding of the endocarp?s structure/property relationships by means of a multi-scale effort integrating novel computational and experimental techniques. A concurrent atomic-continuum (CAC) computational tool will be developed to span all relevant length scales of this materials system naturally. This approach will overcome limitations of current computational approaches, where different length scales are treated with conceptually different models that need to be interfaced. The CAC approach will be used on hierarchical materials for the first time, representing a game changing development for the materials sciences. The experimental efforts will mirror the computational work and provide characterization across all length scales. Scanning probe techniques will play a crucial role in characterizing not only the structure and mechanical properties of nano- and microscale constituents of the endocarp, but also their interfacial interactions. The outcome will be a powerful model that is calibrated and verified across multiple length scales. This model can serve as a basis to establish guidelines for bottom-up hierarchical design of synthetic cellular lightweight materials with outstanding mechanical performance, inspired by the coconut endocarp.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biomaterials progam (BMAT) in the division of materials research (DMR) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Magnetism is a striking example of a phenomenon which arises in crystal materials entirely due to the subtle laws of quantum mechanics. Even though magnetism has been observed and studied since ancient times, modern experimental studies have found time and again this phenomenon to be surprisingly diverse and rich, inspiring a whole new range of intellectual problems for theoretical physicists. For example, it is now well known that one can destroy magnetism by heating any magnetic material above a certain temperature, but studies during the last several decades have indicated that it is also possible to destroy magnetism at the absolute zero of temperature. The mechanisms by which this destruction occurs are subtle, and their fundamental origin is being intensely studied and debated. This research project will contribute to this important scientific endeavor by developing new computational algorithms to study special models of magnetism that can be simulated on a supercomputer and providing an unusual window to this fascinating phenomenon. In addition to this research, the PI will study how magnetism and other quantum mechanical effects arising from strong electron-electron interactions can be created and controlled in specific materials in a laboratory, such as in few layers of carbon atoms stacked on top of each other. <br/><br/>A major part of this project involves the training of graduate and undergraduate students in materials science and computational algorithms.

Understanding the physical processes that give rise to AA is critical, given its impacts on a range of human and natural systems. This project tests the hypothesis that fast atmospheric processes ? known as ?rapid adjustments? ? are fundamental to the occurrence of AA. This represents a new way of thinking about AA, which has traditionally been attributed to much slower processes such as sea-ice loss. The project thus will enhance our understanding of AA and its underlying physical mechanisms, and also has the potential to fundamentally reshape how we view this phenomenon. Broader impacts of the project will include the development of a new curriculum on climate modeling that will be suitable for use in high school Earth science or physics courses.<br/><br/>Despite intense scientific scrutiny, the relative importance of different physical processes in driving Arctic amplification (AA) remains uncertain. Most studies to date to understand these processes have focused on long time scales (e.g., multidecadal and longer). This project, in contrast, focuses on the short time scales of AA. More specifically, the project will test the hypothesis that rapid adjustments to external forcing ? which are the response to the forcing that is independent of global mean surface temperature change ? are fundamental to the occurrence of AA. This hypothesis will be tested by analyzing a series of new and existing global climate model (GCM) simulations. The project will provide the most systematic investigation to date of the role of rapid adjustments in AA, potentially transforming current understanding of AA and its underlying physical mechanisms. The project will also enhance understanding of rapid adjustments more generally, including how they differ between CO2 and non-CO2 forcings, and how they depend on the method used to define them (e.g., ?Gregory? regression versus fixed sea surface temperature GCM simulations). The new GCM simulations created for the project will be made freely available to the scientific community, thus contributing to scientific discovery beyond the scope of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Crucial for life, these assembly lines add building blocks to growing polymer chains one after another in a specific order. This is how DNA and RNA are formed.  In this project, Dr. Schneebeli is imitating the natural assembly-line approach to create well-defined polymeric materials. While this research focuses on enabling and understanding artificial molecular assembly lines, the well-defined polymers created may ultimately be useful materials for a variety of important applications. The artificial molecular assembly lines are created by connecting a catalyst to the polymers with rings that slide along the growing chains. This catalyst adds individual building blocks to the growing polymers one by one. In addition, Dr. Schneebeli is engaging the public in polymer chemistry through K-12 outreach at a local science museum (ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center in Burlington, VT) and at local high schools.

While efficient chain-growth processes exist for numerous conjugated, cyclic, and hyperbranching monomers, this research explores a universal chain-growth strategy for general monomers, many of which cannot yet be polymerized in a controlled manner. Dr. Schneebeli's design prevents the catalysts from falling off the polymers, thus rendering this new living polymerization methodology fully chain-transfer free. Dr. Schneebeli is utilizing this new polymerization technique to enable the enzyme-free translation of DNA templates into diverse, pi-conjugated precision polymers, in a manner analogous to how the ribosome builds proteins. In support of the broader impacts of the project, Dr. Schneebeli is actively engaged in K-12 outreach with special macroscopic dynamic models. These models are devised to lead K-12 students to discover qualitative and quantitative aspects of different polymerization mechanisms to foster discovery-based reasoning and creative thinking among the future STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The geomagnetic field provides a habitable environment for life by shielding it from harmful high energy particles. Thus, the presence of a magnetic field can help support life on the planetary surface. Mars appeared to have had a magnetic field in the past based on remnant magnetic fields in the Martian crust. Mercury currently has a magnetic field, but it is approximately 100 times weaker than that of Earth. Venus does not have any indication of a current or past magnetic field. Some observed planets in extrasolar systems (exoplanets) might have signs of magnetic fields, but further studies are needed. Currently, Earth?s magnetic field is produced by processes in the iron core, which consists of a solid inner core and liquid outer core with some light elements. As Earth cools, the solid inner core grows, releasing heat and light elements to the bottom of the liquid outer core. This facilitates convection in the outer core and contributes to generating a magnetic field. However, it is likely that this mechanism did not operate in the past because recent studies suggest that Earth?s core was completely molten in the early Earth and the solid inner core did not nucleate until recently (~ 0.5 ? 1 Ga). Simultaneously, terrestrial rock records indicate that Earth had a magnetic field by 3.5-4.2 Ga. This may suggest that early Earth generated a magnetic field in a different mechanism from today?s process. It has been hypothesized that planetary magnetic fields may be influenced by meteorite impacts, but the details are not well understood. In this proposal, the team will investigate the mechanisms of Earth?s magnetic field over its history and apply the model to other planets, including Mars, Venus, and exoplanets, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of planetary magnetic fields. This will also help understand the habitability of a planet throughout its lifetime. One of the key aspects of the proposal is participation of local high school, undergraduate and graduate students, who will conduct cutting-edge research, numerical simulations, and learn scientific communication. This proposed work will provide a unique and enriching opportunity that encourages students to pursue STEM career paths.  <br/> <br/>This research will include the following tasks over the next five years to understand the history of magnetic fields of Earth and other planets: (1) Determine the Earth?s initial interior structure. Earth and other planets form by collisions among growing planets. This impact stage determines the initial structure of the planetary core and mantle, which strongly influences whether generation of a magnetic field in the core is likely or not. The team will calculate the planetary interior structure based on impact simulations using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, which calculates fluid flows. (2) Using SPH, the team will investigate how meteorite impacts affect the magnetic field of Earth during the Hadean (4.5-4 Ga) and Archean (4-2.5 Ga) era. (3) Conduct shock experiments. The team will investigate the possibility that early Earth?s magnetic field was produced in an iron-rich silicate melt at the core-mantle boundary (basal magma ocean, BMO) instead of magnetic field generation in the core. For the BMO to generate a magnetic field, the BMO needs to have a very high electrical conductivity, which controls how quickly electrons move in the material. The team will calculate the electrical conductivity of a BMO analogue material based on laser-driven shock experiments at the University of Rochester Laboratory For Laser Energetics. (4) Simulate a magnetic field generation process in BMO using the electrical conductivities estimated in (3) as an input, and (5) apply the model developed for Earth to other planetary bodies, including the Moon, Mars, Venus, and exoplanets to predict the history of their magnetic fields. The proposed projects will be led by two graduate students and contributed by high school and undergraduate students. Four local high school students will join this project as summer interns and they will learn coding, data visualization, and cutting-edge research during Years 1 and 2. They will be responsible for data visualization of impact simulations, which will be used in paper publications and short public videos. During Years 3 and 4, the PI will develop a course focused on science communication and research primarily for first- and second-year undergraduate students, where they will learn planetary impact events, science communications, and how to conduct research. The course includes a field trip to the Sudbury impact basin, which is the second largest basin on Earth. During Year 5, the team will host an exhibit at the Rochester Science and Museum Center (RMSC) to present research output of the team over the past five years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are 10 million primary care visits for urinary tract infections per year in the United States. More than 15% of these patients suffer antibiotic-resistant infections. Clinical studies have shown that accurate identification and early diagnosis of the antibiotic resistance of the infecting bacteria shorten the treatment period, eliminate antibiotic misuse, and reduce average patient costs. However, on-site diagnostic testing that returns molecular information about the bacterial identity and antibiotic resistance remains a significant challenge. Current laboratory-based tests are costly, have long turnaround times, and require skilled technicians and well-equipped laboratories. In most cases, this results in empirical antibiotic prescriptions before the information is returned from test results. Developing rapid, on-site, easy-to-implement, and frequently used antimicrobial resistance screening is essential to combat the ongoing threat of antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic misuse. This device will be suitable for outpatient clinics, home healthcare, and inpatient facilities. It will enable a shift from empirical to evidence-based treatment of bacterial infections.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a point-of-care device for the on-site identification of E. coli and associated extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL) antibiotic resistance genes in urinary tract infections from unprocessed urine samples.

The device consists of a disposable microfluidic cartridge and a portable multifunctional reader. The self-contained microfluidic sensing cartridge supports sample preparation, isothermal amplification, and sequence-specific electrochemical detection. This novel combination of sensing technology and highly integrated sample handling microfluidics will enable the development of critically needed point-of-care diagnostic solutions.

In each of the three summers of the program, ten students are selected for ten weeks of residential activities. The specific program objectives are as follows: (1) Students will develop competency in scientific research, as well as presentation and writing skills. (2) Students will produce meaningful research results, which may be written up for publication in an appropriate conference or journal. (3) Participants will learn to present and disseminate research results. Technical activities will be integrated with group activities, such as site visits to local area research laboratories and seminars by academic and industrial researchers, as well as alumni of the REU program. (4) Participants will sustain and increase their interest in research careers after the summer, through continuing contacts and research participation, including presentations of research results. The focus is on professional development so students can continue to work on research projects at their home university and be prepared for graduate studies. Students will take part in workshops on career development, ethics and legal issues (e. g., intellectual property), and methods of literature search; they will receive extensive advice on questions related to graduate school, including how to choose a program/school/advisor. The goal is for the program?s mentors to make a lasting impact on its participants beyond the program's duration.

This improvement of six orders of magnitude of added capability is unheard of in any other industry worldwide. Although the semiconductor industry has made significant progress over the years, it is now reaching the physical limits of silicon, where a transistor contains only a few silicon atoms. Hence the question is, ""What is the future of semiconductors over the next 50 years?"" The objective of this project is to address this question by building a research team to develop a co-design approach that includes materials, devices, and systems to create a revolutionary breakthrough for shoring up US capabilities in the next generations of the semiconductor industry. The research team in this award represents an interdisciplinary cross-section of several important disciplines within engineering. In addition, the project revolves around participation from underrepresented groups by involving them in science and technology.<br/>   <br/>The neuromorphic integrated circuit (NIC) developed in this project uses the monolithically integrated 3D stacks of a novel floating-gate carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (FG-CNFET) to create a revolutionary breakthrough in semiconductor technology by extending Moore's law beyond transistor scaling in a single layer. It is an enabling technology that provides additional non-deterministic computing capability to conventional deterministic computing hardware to perform complex computation in a highly energy-efficient analog circuit. Moreover, due to its massive parallelism and reconfigurability, the proposed NIC hardware is inherently fault-tolerant, perfectly suitable for devices compatible with monolithic 3D integration, but typically suffers from high defect rates, as for instance exhibited by FG-CNFETs. The proposed NIC has three distinctive features that no existing technology can offer: 1) reconfigurable and scalable neuromorphic architecture, 2) built-in analog signal processing units capable of highly energy-efficient non-deterministic computing, and 3) utilization of advanced devices that are compatible with monolithic 3D integration, rectifying their imperfections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed array architecture, without knowledge of its own errors, will provide dual support for radio-frequency fingerprinting based authentication and physical layer security. Machine learning methods, in particular deep neural networks, will be used to perform authentication using the enhanced radio-frequency fingerprints, which should yield significantly greater accuracy compared to using radio frequency fingerprints of regular antenna arrays. To mathematically analyze the improvement in the authentication capacity, information theoretic bounds for authentication success probability and attack success probability will be studied. Possible adversarial machine learning attacks to chaotic antenna arrays and defense strategies will be also investigated.

Nanostructured (NS) titanium dioxides, TiO2, have been, and remain, of significant commercial and research interest due to their use in a wide range of fields including paints, catalysis, photocatalysis, and others. Amongst these, NS TiO2, commercially sold as P25, commands a small, but important market share. P25 is manufactured by gas-flame synthesis, a relatively slow and expensive method. This method has, however, long been considered the gold standard in many catalytic and photocatalytic reactions but its use has been limited by its high cost. Should society elect to run on electrochemically generated, or green, hydrogen (H2), the rate limiting step is not at the H2 electrode, but rather the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode. Commercially, iridium dioxide (IrO2) is used for OER. Iridium is one of the rarest elements on the Earth's crust. Apart from its cost, the world would rapidly run into serious supply issues if green H2 is mass produced. As a result, the proposed technology for producing H2 using NS TiO2 may be a cheaper and greener alternative to such OER catalysts.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of affordable, stable, and high efficiency electrodes for electrolysis. The method is a one pot, near ambient, hugely scalable, bottom-up approach that converts cheap, green, abundant water, insoluble non-toxic precursors such as TiC and TiB2 into one-dimensional, Carbon-containing, titania-based nanofilaments (1DT NFs). Amongst the commercially available photocatalytic titanias, Evonik Aeroxide TiO2 P25, synthesized via flame pyrolysis of TiCl4, is widely used because of its high photocatalytic activity in many reaction systems. In many ways P25 has been considered the gold standard for catalysis and photocatalytic applications. Its major drawback, however, is its cost. Flame pyrolysis is expensive and does not yield large quantities of material. This project is a method of synthesis of materials that are not only significantly cheaper to fabricate but perform better than P25 in several applications including dye degradation and H2 production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research asks: ?Why are some communities more vulnerable to diseases than others?"" To address this broad question, this work focuses on understanding how biodiversity influences community disease risk. While many studies find that communities with higher biodiversity have lower disease risk, some studies show no effect of biodiversity on disease risk and others even find the opposite effect (i.e. communities with higher biodiversity have higher disease risk). Overall, the idea that biodiversity can reduce disease risk is attractive because it suggests that protecting biodiversity has clear benefits to both nature and society. This research tests the central hypothesis that cryptic differences in population?s responses to past conditions (i.e. evolutionary history) plays an important role in understanding when biodiversity will reduce disease risk. This CAREER award will develop a summer research and outreach program that supports undergraduate artists, engineers, biologists, and educators and a 3rd grade citizen science training program.<br/><br/>The Biodiversity-Disease (BDD) Relationship has generated considerable attention as a theoretical framework for predicting community disease outcomes. Yet, limited consensus on the generality of the BDD relationship has been reached leading to repeated calls to uncover factors shaping the magnitude and direction of the BDD relationship. This research tests the hypothesis that intraspecific host variation, generated by divergent evolutionary histories, plays a cryptic role in shaping the direction and magnitude of the BDD relationship. To this end, the research focuses on amphibian host-parasite interactions and takes advantage of an experimentally tractable group of focal wood frog populations that exhibit intraspecific variation in parasite susceptibility as a result of evolving in contrasting environments. The researchers will first, evaluate the contribution of intraspecific variation to shaping the BDD relationship by generating mesocosm communities that vary in amphibian host species diversity and focal host intraspecific diversity. Second, to integrate ecological context into our understanding of how intraspecific variation influences the BDD relationship, the researchers will conduct lab and mesocosm studies testing whether intraspecific variation in focal hosts can shape the BDD relationship by modifying (a) competitive, (b) predator-prey, or (c) host microbiota interactions. Third, to complement the controlled experimental studies, the researchers will conduct a citizen-led field surveys to evaluate whether intraspecific variation modifies the BDD relationship in more complex natural ecosystems. Towards this aim, the researchers will develop a two-step integrated education-research program: (1) Content development: Researchers will design an interdisciplinary program where undergraduates work with local communication and education experts to develop a citizen training program. (2) Implementation: Citizens will complete training program and collect field data that contributes to the overarching research goals. Collectively, this integration will facilitate citizen data collection efforts, diversify STEM training and engagement, and broaden access to authentic research opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries. <br/><br/>It is important to understand how melting ice on the surface of ice sheets, caused by a warming climate, affects the movement of the ice sheets. As the climate warms, melting ice at the surface of ice sheets form ponds of meltwater. In order to have an impact on the movement of the Greenland Ice Sheet, the meltwater must reach and lubricate the bottom of the ice sheet. For example, lakes on the surface of the ice sheet can drain through cracks and reach the bottom of the ice sheet within a few hours. To understand the formation of these cracks and the cause of draining lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet, we plan to use deep learning, an artificial intelligence algorithm, to find the locations of cracks and draining lakes in satellite imagery. Based on this new dataset, we will use mathematical models to understand the formation of new cracks and their impact on the movement of the ice sheet. Our approach contains an exciting mix of observations and mathematical models. The ability to use artificial intelligence to detect cracks and draining lakes offers opportunities to drive new understandings at the ice-sheet scale. Broader Impacts: This project will support (1) a US-UK collaboration; (2) students and junior scientists; (3) the development of open-source artificial intelligence codes for the Arctic sciences community; (4) the production of a comprehensive and freely available database of the Greenland Ice Sheet cracks and draining lakes; and (5) a community-led mentoring program called COMPACT (COmmunity-led Mentoring Program for Advancing Cryosphere Trainees), which will facilitate multi-mentor networks within the US and UK cryospheric communities for minority doctoral students. Overall, this research will help us understand how ice sheets respond to a changing climate.<br/><br/>Meltwater that forms on the surface of the ice sheet can seep through moulins and fractures that connect the surface to the bed, lubricating the bottom of the ice sheet and influencing its dynamics. Surface-to-bed meltwater pathways are prevalent across the Greenland Ice Sheet. However, we currently lack the continent-wide maps of moulins, crevasses, and draining lakes needed to understand the formation of surface-to-bed meltwater pathways. Utilizing deep learning techniques for automated detection and mapping of ice sheet surface features can greatly enhance the glaciology community's capacity to analyze high-resolution satellite imagery, leading to new discoveries. By harnessing deep neural networks, this project aims to generate continent-wide databases of surface features that can be used to mechanistically model the ice sheet conditions that create new surface-to-bed pathways and their impact on ice-sheet dynamics. The ability to scale up feature detection to the ice sheet scale can enrich both remote sensing and modeling communities. This project will foster a US-UK collaboration involving junior principal investigators, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students. The project aims to develop open-source deep learning code, remote-sensing algorithms, and subglacial hydrology model code for the broader glaciological community. The resulting database of Greenland Ice Sheet surface-to-bed pathway locations and supraglacial lake drainage dates and locations will be made open source. The principal investigators will also collaborate to establish a community-led mentoring program within the US and UK cryospheric community to promote the retention of underrepresented doctoral students and junior faculty/scientists.

Coastal sediments have been surmised to be a significant microplastic ?sink,? but few studies have been completed on microplastic below the surface layer. Additionally, this study investigates the impacts of hurricanes on microplastic transport and burial in coastal sediments. Understanding the deposition rates of microplastic in coastal sediments is extremely important as plastic in the marine and coastal environment has been categorized as a global problem directly resulting from human activities. Data from this study can inform environmental policy-making on plastic pollution, positively influencing the health of sensitive coastal communities.<br/><br/>Investigating the stratigraphic signature of microplastic in coastal sediments is an emerging field of study and contributes to a better understanding of environmental pollution and estimates of microplastic abundance. This project includes field-based data collection to inform environmental modeling to produce large-scale estimates.

However, too much or too little iron can be problematic and a significant contributor to human diseases. Iron not immediately utilized by cells is stored in ferritin, a ubiquitous 24-subunit-nanostructure that plays a critical role in cellular and systemic iron homeostasis and serves as the principal reservoir of metabolic iron within the cell.  The goals of this project are to understand the mechanisms of ferritin trafficking and regulation within and out of the cell and how these processes are controlled. This project will provide a strong interdisciplinary training experience for undergraduate and graduate students and for postdoctoral fellows at four different institutions in the US and Israel and thus extend unique opportunities for these trainees and their faculty mentors to work together and innovate.   <br/><br/>Iron homeostasis is a tightly regulated process through the tuning of cellular iron import, export, and storage.  Different proteins and iron regulators including the peptide hormone hepcidin, the iron regulatory proteins IRP1 and IRP2, the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), the iron chaperone protein PCBP1, the nuclear receptor coactivator NCOA4, and the iron storage protein ferritin play important roles in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Despite intense research over the past decades and the physiological significance of iron homeostasis, there is a lack of full understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying both cellular and systemic iron homeostasis. Using a combination of structural and molecular biology, spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, quantitative proteomics, and analytical and biophysical tools, the team will address fundamental questions in iron metabolism and will delineate the mechanisms that determine the fate of cellular ferritin and its trafficking route, from the protein-protein molecular level to the cellular level. For the first time, the investigators will explore biochemical, biophysical, structural, and cellular elucidation of previously uncharacterized NCOA4/PCBP1/ferritin interactions. The background and interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will create unique opportunities to promote STEM research and education for undergraduate and graduate students, particularly historically underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students. Additionally, all trainees and senior research personnel will be exposed to different technologies, scientific communities, and research opportunities with the goal of enhancing innovation, scientific training, and citizenship in an increasingly global society.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular this project examines the emergence and influence of investor farmers. Investor farmers are actors that do not reside on-farm and for whom farming is a financial investment rather than an occupation or mode of subsistence. This disconnect between farm and residence may result in different farm management strategies compared to farms where the owner resides on-farm. Using a combination of interviews and archival research this research project investigates how and whether investor farmers are influencing the development of commercial agriculture in places where more traditional farming systems persist. The project advances the understanding of changing rural-urban relationships, the role of investor farmers in shaping farming systems, and the development of rural areas. <br/><br/>The project investigates how urban-based, medium-scale investor farmers are influencing processes of agrarian change. The amount of land occupied by medium-scale farms has been increasing in many regions of the world, a process that is commonly driven by urban residents seeking financial returns through agricultural investments that they manage from afar. While investor farmers are often recognized as drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship, their actual role in transforming farming systems and advancing agricultural commercialization is unclear. A mixed methods approach is applied including semi-structured interviews with investor farmers, farm managers, landowners and government officials. Oral life histories of investor farmers are employed to understand the pathways by which investor farmers become central actors in land acquisition and agricultural transformation. Archival research of NGO reports, government reports and newspaper articles is used to identify how the process of agricultural transformations are represented by different actors and in varying outlets. All data are coded for semantic analysis using NVIVO. Given global population growth trends and the continued reliance on agriculture as a vehicle of economic development, the increasing control of rural agricultural land by investor farmers has significant implications for the future of agricultural production. This research project contributes to an understanding of the role of medium-scale farm investors and their contribution to food security, rural-urban inequalities, and economic development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Memristive technology has shown significant potential to be part of high-density next generation neuromorphic processors to support energy efficient AI algorithms. The physics of memristive switching is promising since in theory, the device state can change through the movement of only few ions under very low voltage. However, device non-idealities have prevented using memristor chips for neural network training due to performance sub-par to software solutions. Memristors and other emerging devices promise major societal impact via key applications e.g. medical implants, robotics, Internet of Things, etc. that need compact and efficient computing. However, their commercial adoption requires academic leaps in performance, yield, reliability and workforce training. This project will develop the next generation of memristors, based on entropy-stabilized oxides with engineered switching dynamics. This work will enable the discovery of new materials for memristor devices and support the development of efficient computing technologies, in line with the national focus on semiconductor competitiveness and next generation microelectronics. Moreover, this project seamlessly integrates the research and education objectives to support the necessary workforce development in this field. The efforts include overhaul of a nanoelectronics course to make it more accessible, interdisciplinary research training for diverse students, the development of a comprehensive virtual reality memristor simulator, providing github documentation to the community and outreach to local high schools. The developed models and experimental platforms will give students a hands-on education on these devices, their manufacturing, and their use in neuromorphic hardware for novel applications.<br/><br/>This CAREER project aims to create ultra-low variability analog memristors by exploiting the underlying material properties and physical phenomena in entropy-stabilized oxides. By comparison with existing approaches attempting structural filament confinement at mesoscopic (micron) scales using phase separation, this project proposes filament confinement at nanometer scales for better switching uniformity. Entropy-stabilized oxides will be explored because they provide a broad compositional space and potential for high-quality films deposited at CMOS-suitable temperatures where the requirements for desired switching dynamics can be met. These complex oxides will be used to investigate the nanoscale control of the filament dynamics by allowing the oxygen vacancies to preferentially move along energetically-favorable trajectories, while the lattice is entropy-stabilized. To this effect, the work will innovate across four intertwined research and educational objectives. Objective #1 will focus on the identification of suitable entropy-stabilized films and their use in engineering memristor devices with ultra-low variability. Objective #2 will integrate and characterize these entropy-stabilized memristors on transistor chips using suitable buffer layers. Objective #3 will use the experimental dataset to develop multi-dimensional device models useful in neural network simulations and use the fabricated chips to prototype perceptrons and transformer neural networks with software-equivalent accuracy. Objective #4 will target the development and incorporation of experiential learning activities to support the training of diverse students in the field. This project will make critical advances in the understanding of the underlying material and physical requirements for ultra-low variability memristors and investigate their potential performance for next generation artificial intelligence hardware.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to its scientific goals, this project will help create a diverse and technically literate workforce by providing a research-rich learning environment at Eastern Michigan University, a primarily undergraduate institution that serves a racially and socioeconomically diverse population of students. Twelve undergraduate and two master?s students will be supported to perform cutting-edge biochemical research for 1-2 years each. In addition, the project will help support semester-long, guided research experiences for ~24 undergraduate students taking a research-based senior-level biochemistry laboratory course. These two activities will provide students with the practical and intellectual skills needed to become the next generation of science, technology, and engineering professionals. <br/><br/>This project uses yeast genetics to advance our understanding of the formation of the autophagosome, a double-membraned vesicle that envelops cellular cargo and delivers it to the vacuole (or, in metazoans, the lysosome) for degradation. Although previous research in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has established the proteins necessary for this process, much remains to be learned about how they function to carry it out. One central player is the Atg8 conjugation system, which attaches the small ubiquitin-like protein Atg8 to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine, thus defining the forming autophagic membrane. Previous research has shown that the amount of Atg8 in a cell determines how large autophagosomes become, but not the number created. However, Atg7, which catalyzes the first step in the pathway leading to Atg8 conjugation, determines both the size and the number of autophagosomes. This project will investigate additional proteins in this pathway to resolve this conundrum and determine which branch of the pathway affects autophagosome number. The project will also investigate the molecular details of Atg11, a protein that organizes autophagosome formation around autophagic cargo by binding to and arranging core autophagy proteins. Mutational analysis of a region of Atg11 that preliminary data has shown to be crucial for binding to one of its key partners will demonstrate which specific residues are essential for this interaction. Finally, an improved mathematical simulation to allow more accurate estimation autophagosome size and number from transmission electron microscopy sections will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today?s drinking water treatment systems are suffering from high volumes of generated waste (~100,000 tons sludge per typical plant per year) and high maintenance requirements and costs (4x/year week-long clarifier decommissioning for cleaning). The aging infrastructure of many of the nation?s water treatment plants has left millions of Americans with inadequate drinking water. This situation, paired with the aging and shrinking water operator workforce, translates into a growing threat of water supply interruptions and noncompliance. Owing to its small footprint and low energy and maintenance demands, the proposed technology would deliver an easily implementable solution that could be adopted by communities and water systems around the world, even in remote areas. Successfully developed, the WTP will offer a unique economic opportunity to meet critical global sustainable development goals and promote human health and welfare. This technology will lower the barriers to upgrading the nation?s water infrastructure, creating jobs through the introduction of long-delayed upgrades through plant implementation.<br/><br/>Elements of the innovation under development for the proposed water treatment plant include a self-modulating feedback/feedforward controller driving automated coagulant dosing, which is paired with a high-efficiency hydraulic flocculator that leverages turbulent flow to promote floc formation while remaining free of failure-prone moving parts; a self-cleaning clarifier fitted with settling plates and a sludge blanket system for efficient contaminant removal; a stacked sand filter that decreases the hydraulic loading rate for a given flow and bed volume, resulting in improved stability of the deposited particles (i.e., reduced shear and particle breakthrough); and a continuous sludge dewatering and treatment system that decreases the volume of produced sludge while also providing a continuous waste stream for further processing. While early efforts have established a proof-of-concept demonstrating operations at 50% less energy demand than conventional systems, continued research and development to improve system performance and autonomy are needed. In line with this effort, the Phase I effort will focus on: 1) development of an automated control system for precise coagulant dosing; 2) design modification to minimize waste stream volume; and 3) design and construction of a pilot plant with 15 gallons per minute capacity, suitable to meet the water treatment needs of communities of ~300 people.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

FESS are mechanical batteries that overcome some of the limitations of lithium-ion batteries, such as the loss of energy capacity over time and the need for stringent temperature control. In space, FESS could reduce the overall mass associated with the battery pack and extend the mission life of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. On earth, FESS can take over some of the applications that are required to deliver high power for a short amount of time, such as electric vehicle charging stations or hospital back-up power units. Ultimately, FESS will help alleviate the demand for lithium-ion batteries while providing reliable, long-lasting energy storage.<br/><br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the proposed magnetic bearing into a carbon-fiber flywheel. The complexity of this task comes from having the three main parts of the flywheel (composite rim, metal core, and magnets) created using different manufacturing processes. The magnetic materials need to be protected as they will not withstand the high speeds of FESS. De-risking this manufacturing process is crucial in continuing the development of this technology and in scaling up. Another challenge is that the high speeds of FESS are expected to cause high gyroscopic torques during satellite maneuvers. Therefore, investigating ways to increase bearing stiffness (e.g., by changing magnet size and position, or modifying coil shape), while assessing the effect of gyroscopic torques through numerical models, will be paramount. Finally, the magnetic bearing has the distinctive feature of being able to tilt the flywheel (within its gap tolerances), without requiring an external gimbal actuator. This feature could possibly allow the technology to be used for dual purposes, and its implications will be investigated at a system level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meanwhile, many countries have recently decentralized the provision of many basic services to municipal governments. This means that understanding municipal politics is critical if populations are to have access to basic health, education, and infrastructure services. Such services enable participation in labor markets and facilitate economic development, and thereby contribute to political and social stability. This project will document the extent to which service access and quality vary across cities of different sizes in four large, highly decentralized democracies in three world regions. It will inform policymaking by shedding light on the political factors driving differences in the quality and reach of vital local services across cities of different sizes. In particular, project findings will position policymakers to more effectively target lending and grants intended to improve local service delivery in low- and middle-income countries. <br/><br/>This project proposes and tests a new theoretical explanation of variation in policy priorities and service delivery outcomes across cities of different sizes. It theorizes that officials in smaller cities will prioritize investments in basic health and education facilities, whereas officials in larger cities will devote attention to a broader set of policy areas, and prioritize more specialized health and education services over clinics and schools. These differences stem from the greater prevalence non-state health and education providers in larger cities, greater voter concerns regarding urban problems (i.e., congestion, crime) in larger cities, and politicians? greater ability to claim and attribute credit for basic health and education facilities in smaller cities. Research will test this theory using a variety of types of data, including: compiled administrative and political data from each of the case study countries; geospatial data on the location of public facilities; social media posts and livestreamed city council meetings; surveys with citizens and politicians; and qualitative research in case study cities of different sizes.

This project aims to understand the physiological response of mixotrophs exposed to micronutrient limitation in the Southern Ocean, specifically iron, manganese and simultaneous limitation of more than one trace metal, or colimitation. Such environmental conditions are characteristic of the Southern Ocean and can only be tested with local algae. The Principal Investigators hypothesize that under trace metal colimitation, some mixotrophs will have a competitive advantage by increasing their ability to consume particles to obtain energy and trace metals from their prey. Given the lack of understanding of how mixotrophs have adapted to the micronutrient limitation, the researchers propose studies with microalgal cultures isolated from the Southern Ocean; they will measure growth responses, consumption behavior, changes in cellular chemistry and transcription of genetic material in response to iron and manganese limitation. This project benefits the National Science Foundation goals of understanding Life in Antarctica and adaptation of organisms to this extreme environment. Society will benefit from the training proposed, whereby students from rural colleges will be instructed in computer coding and scientific data analyses. Furthermore, this work will support one graduate student, two undergraduate summer interns, and two early career scientists.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators hypothesize that under Fe-Mn colimitation, some mixotrophs will have a competitive advantage by increasing their grazing rates to obtain energy, Fe, and Mn from their prey. Given the lack of understanding of how mixotrophs have adapted to seasonal changes in the availability of these micronutrients and how they influence mixotrophic growth dynamics, the PIs propose culture studies to measure growth responses, grazing behavior, and changes in elemental stoichiometry in response to Fe and Mn limitation. Transcriptomic analyses will reveal the metabolic underpinnings of trophic behavior and micronutrient stress responses, with implications for key biogeochemical processes such as carbon fixation, remineralization, and nutrient cycling. Results are expected to clarify the ecological roles of Antarctic mixotrophs and elucidate the adaptations of Southern Ocean organisms to their unique polar ecosystem following the 2015 Strategic Vision for Polar Programs. This work will support one graduate student, two undergraduate summer interns, and two early career scientists. A series of virtual coding and bioinformatic workshops will be organized, in which basic principles of coding, and data processing used in the proposed analysis will be taught to undergraduate students. Small colleges in rural areas will be targeted for 8 modules on bioinformatics training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These pH sensors have been deployed on hundreds of autonomous profiling floats, underwater gliders, and moorings to study ocean carbon cycling in environments ranging from the intertidal zone, coral reefs, to the open ocean. Additionally, they are commonly utilized in laboratory mesocosms to study impacts of ocean acidification. The key enabling technology for the DuraFET is an Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET) semiconductor chip, manufactured by Honeywell Co. The Honeywell ISFET has several unique features that give it superior performance relative to its competitors. This in essence results in a sole-source for DuraFET pH sensors, and represents a key vulnerability for ocean carbon monitoring. To address this, this proposal aims to accelerate the development of alternative pH sensors that can be scaled to fit the current needs of global ocean observational networks.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will test and develop two promising pH sensor candidates that are capable of long-term deployments (years) to 2 km depth on autonomous platforms such as profiling floats and gliders, as well as for moored instrumentation and laboratory mesocosm applications. First, the performance of a commercially available optical pH optode sensor (distributed by PyroScience) will be assessed. This is a relatively new sensor for oceanography, thus its performance has not been thoroughly characterized to the satisfaction of chemical oceanographers. Second, a pH sensor that utilizes an ISFET from a different supplier will be developed. Both pH sensors that will be explored are solid state, small, and low-power, making them good candidates for autonomous platforms. The sensors will be thoroughly characterized in the laboratory for pH response, long term drift, salinity, temperature, and pressure effects, response time, and hysteresis. Both sensors will then be deployed on coastal moorings, underwater gliders, and profiling floats to assess in situ performance across a range of conditions over months to years. Results from this development will be rapidly and efficiently shared with the oceanographic community through recurring webinars, publications, and collaboration with industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These elements can be harvested from natural resources through traditional mining approaches or by processing industrial waste sources. In many cases, the lanthanides must be separated from the actinides, like uranium and thorium, before they can be used in the final application. Lanthanides and actinides are currently separated by solvent extraction approaches - a chemical process with large physical and carbon footprints and also generates mixed radioactive waste. Membrane-based separations are an alternative to solvent extraction that can have a smaller physical footprint and minimize the volume of waste generated. Thus, designing membrane materials that can selectively achieve these separations is a key step in improving the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of these processes. The fundamental knowledge generated in this project will guide the design of future membranes that will be used in lanthanide/actinide separations from various feedstocks. The ability to selectively separate lanthanides from actinides via membranes will enhance national security and improve the efficiency of resource recovery and water treatment. This research program is integrated with an educational program that will develop service-learning opportunities for graduate students, engage the local Cleveland community through nuclear-focused outreach activities, and build a training program for future STEM educators focusing on inclusive teaching strategies.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand the molecular-level phenomena that underpin ion-ion selectivity in copolymer ligands used for f-element separations. This goal will be achieved by synthesizing polymer ligands with controlled compositions to serve as a platform for studying ligand-ligand and ligand-ion interactions. Molecular interactions will be investigated through a combined approach of computational modeling and spectroscopy. Finally, the polymer ligands will be coated on membrane surfaces. These studies will reveal the practical implications of intermolecular interactions on affinity, kinetics, and selectivity. This research will be integrated with a graduate-level radiochemistry course in which students will develop teaching tools to communicate radiochemistry concepts to non-scientific audiences. These tools will be deployed at outreach events that target K-12 students in Cleveland through partnerships with the Leonard Gelfand STEM Center and the Girl Scouts of Northeast Ohio.

The goal is to enable irrigators in water-scarce environments to maximize yields given the water available, and to mitigate the impacts of drought and aquifer reduction by enabling irrigators to calibrate their systems to the precise needs of the plants.  The impact of this system is to maximize productivity of irrigation water, reducing waste and costs for crop growers and other irrigators. The commercialization of this product will provide the data needed for precision irrigation to respond to daily ground water needs, broadly reducing water consumption in agriculture and other markets. This technology translates a known methodology for soil moisture monitoring used by researchers and academics into a tool that delivers actionable data to end users that steward the world?s water resources. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research and development is to verify that data from an arrayed set of smaller Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS) systems, ingested into an interpolation algorithm, can provide a soil moisture heat map with resolution at the level of each irrigation point for water measurements in the field. This project will remove the main technical risks associated with applying the CRNS methodology to a sub-field measurement scale, providing actionable data through granular moisture analysis. This data will be compared with a similar heat map generated by a multi hour, high labor assay using a manual probing system. This comparison seeks to support automated, precision irrigation systems to minimize water usage and correct for overwatering. The main technical hurdles that will be addressed include: the data collection from an array of smaller-form-factor CRNS systems that are placed on the field at the spacing of the desired measurement resolution; integration of neutron count data over the large temporal scales that are necessary to overcome the noise associated with the less efficient detectors; and the ability to provide the necessary temporally-changing information that is relevant to the irrigation manager.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accordingly, juvenile justice systems throughout the nation have adopted research-based, juvenile risk and needs assessment tools that can be used to inform youths? case plans. These tools, many of which are algorithmically based, are used by decision makers, such as judges, to estimate youths? risk for reoffending as well as identify factors that may make reoffense more (or less) likely. Although research has generally shown that risk assessment tools are more accurate and less biased than the unstructured judgements of decision makers, some research has shown that these tools have the potential to perpetuate and mask racial disparities and other historical inequities (Goal et al., 2021; St. John et al., 2020). Research on risk assessments has been limited, however, by the fact that it has almost exclusively focused on the tools themselves?rarely examining how decision makers use the tools in practice. This limited focus is problematic because in practice, these tools are intended to provide information to decision makers rather than replace them. Thus, biases can potentially be introduced not just in the risk assessments themselves but also in decisions on whether to accept or reject the assessment's recommendation. To address this issue, this study will examine how decision makers use risk assessments. Importantly, we will examine how different contextual factors affect the use of the tool as well as how the use of the tool affects youth outcomes. A key goal of this study will be to develop policy and practice guidance to promote more effective and equitable use of risk assessments. <br/><br/>To achieve the study aims, we will partner with a juvenile justice agency in a Southern state?which implements a statewide juvenile risk and needs assessment tool?to conduct a three-year mixed-methods study. We will conduct primary data collection, including a survey and focus groups, with judges and analyze secondary data from the state juvenile justice and education agencies, law enforcement, and the American Community Survey. Secondary data will include variables such as youths? sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, and sex); risk assessment scores; case histories (e.g., offense severity); disposition received (e.g., probation, commitment); recidivism (12-month re-adjudication); and educational outcomes (e.g., high school completion) as well as community characteristics, such as the presence of racial disparities in policing, median household income, and the percent of residents that are people of color. These data allow us to directly identify cases in which the disposition a youth received differs from what the risk score recommended. We will use data from June 2017 to July 2023 (with sensitivity analyses performed to assess how inclusion of data from the pandemic affects study results), which we anticipate will include approximately 23,000 youth records. We will use regression analysis and multi-level modeling to answer our research questions?assessing both (1) the circumstances that increase the likelihood a decision maker will override the risk assessment; and (2) how use (or non-use) of risk assessments? recommendations affect youths? educational outcomes and likelihood of reoffending. We will supplement administrative data with the primary data collection to gather more in-depth data on how judges? use and perceive the use of risk assessments. We will present the study findings in multiple ways, so they are accessible to both practitioners and researchers, including formats such as a webinar, conference presentation, and journal articles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These pH sensors have been deployed on hundreds of autonomous profiling floats, underwater gliders, and moorings to study ocean carbon cycling in environments ranging from the intertidal zone, coral reefs, to the open ocean. Additionally, they are commonly utilized in laboratory mesocosms to study impacts of ocean acidification. The key enabling technology for the DuraFET is an Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET) semiconductor chip, manufactured by Honeywell Co. The Honeywell ISFET has several unique features that give it superior performance relative to its competitors. This in essence results in a sole-source for DuraFET pH sensors, and represents a key vulnerability for ocean carbon monitoring. To address this, this proposal aims to accelerate the development of alternative pH sensors that can be scaled to fit the current needs of global ocean observational networks.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will test and develop two promising pH sensor candidates that are capable of long-term deployments (years) to 2 km depth on autonomous platforms such as profiling floats and gliders, as well as for moored instrumentation and laboratory mesocosm applications. First, the performance of a commercially available optical pH optode sensor (distributed by PyroScience) will be assessed. This is a relatively new sensor for oceanography, thus its performance has not been thoroughly characterized to the satisfaction of chemical oceanographers. Second, a pH sensor that utilizes an ISFET from a different supplier will be developed. Both pH sensors that will be explored are solid state, small, and low-power, making them good candidates for autonomous platforms. The sensors will be thoroughly characterized in the laboratory for pH response, long term drift, salinity, temperature, and pressure effects, response time, and hysteresis. Both sensors will then be deployed on coastal moorings, underwater gliders, and profiling floats to assess in situ performance across a range of conditions over months to years. Results from this development will be rapidly and efficiently shared with the oceanographic community through recurring webinars, publications, and collaboration with industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Undoubtedly, understanding and supporting students? development of graph literacy is an important task educators, researchers, and curricula developers collectively share. Studies have documented secondary school students? difficulties with graphical representations, yet, there is a need for theories focused on students? mathematical thinking that can be used by mathematics teachers, teacher educators, and researchers to better support the development of students? graph literacy in various domains of mathematics (e.g., algebra, statistics, geometry). This project examines middle school students? graph literacy from an asset-based perspective, documenting the ways in which students think about graphs (i.e., their cognitive strategies and intuitive insights), and the ways in which instruction can build upon that thinking in order to support the development of graph literacy. <br/><br/>Drawing from students? graphical representations of real-life contexts (e.g., population growth) that span various mathematical domains, this program of research will develop a holistic theoretical framework that can inform mathematics instruction in multiple content areas. The framework will model the cognitive strategies and intuitive insights students build upon when reading and writing graphs, and map how students? graph literacy changes and develops across the middle grades. Using a design-based methodology consisting of task-based clinical interviews with middle school students, this work will also iteratively design, test, and refine a set of empirically-tested graphing tasks for use by both teachers and researchers, a library of videos illustrating student thinking as they engage in graphing tasks, and publications and curricular materials for teachers and teacher educators.<br/><br/>The award is funded in part by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

In the atmosphere, dust particles modify radiation budget (via absorption, scattering, and emission) and interact with clouds, affecting a wide range of atmospheric processes. Each year a large amount of African dust is transported toward the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The westward transport pathway is regulated by atmospheric circulations and reaches its maximum northward position in boreal summer, when the hot, dry Saharan dust plumes often drift across the tropical North Atlantic into the Caribbean Basin and the United States.  Extremely high dust loadings over the tropical North Atlantic are reported during some African dust outbreaks, along with high surface concentrations of dust over Puerto Rico and the southern United States that greatly degraded air quality in these downwind regions. While significant progress has been made toward characterizing trans-Atlantic African dust plumes, the causes and impacts of warm season extreme trans-Atlantic dust events are not fully understood. For instance, it is not clear why enhanced dust emissions in North Africa resulted in extremely high dust loading over the tropical Atlantic in some years but not others. This project will use satellite products, ground observations, and reanalysis to identify atmospheric circulation and land surface processes that are responsible for the extreme trans-Atlantic dust events and to examine how extreme dust plumes affect energy balance, clouds, and air quality along their westward transport pathway. The relative roles of dust emissions and transport in the formation of extreme trans-Atlantic African dust plumes will be examined in both observations and numerical experiments using a regional chemistry model. The proposed work includes scientific training for undergraduate and graduate students and educational activities through outreach events held by the University of Kansas Natural History Museum.<br/><br/>North Africa is a prominent global source of atmospheric aerosols. Advanced knowledge of the variability, causes, and impacts of extreme trans-Atlantic African dust events will allow better understanding of the role of aerosols in the climate system, which is one of the major sources of uncertainty in evaluating current and predicting future climate change. The findings will benefit future studies of trans-continental dust events and air pollution forecast in the United States. The project will integrate research with education by engaging undergraduate students into the project and by incorporating research activities and findings into undergraduate and graduate courses.

The proposed device simultaneously generates and transmits vehicle to vehicle information over a secure high-bandwidth wired connection.  The transit bus and trucking industries, as well as the United States military, have the potential to benefit. Given the routine proximity to pedestrians and bicyclists, transit agencies have a unique requirement for safety and reliability. These stringent requirements prevent the widespread adoption of the traditional, untethered, fully autonomous transit vehicles. However, these requirements may be readily met by the proposed technology. In the trucking and logistics industries, massive labor shortages can be filled and the productivity of fleet operators increased, without any compromise on safety and reliability. Likewise, the United States military Leader-Follower operations, which uses traditional platooning, may be improved.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an automated vehicle following technology where the vehicles are physically connected.

Over the past ten years, spinal fusions have moved toward minimally invasive techniques supported by improved pedicle screws and better image guidance. These techniques have allowed smaller incision sizes, reduced tissue damage, and fewer misplaced pedicle screws. Despite these technical advances, studies have reported 10-40% of patients experience new or residual pain following spinal fusion. Moreover, 15% of patients need revision surgery within five years of their first spinal fusion. Smaller incision sizes have been linked to reduced patient back pain, time to ambulation, hospital length of stay, opioid use, and risk of surgical site infection. By creating tools tailored to the unique clinical needs identified by spinal surgeons, this technology can help these surgeons avoid complications and minimize the likelihood of pain and revision surgery. The development of smart tools offering surgeons greater degrees of intraoperative freedom can be expanded beyond the screwdriver, opening up a vast array of commercial applications in medical and surgical practice.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of technology to make surgical screwdrivers smart by offering neuro-navigation compatibility, high surgeon comfort and ease of use, retention of haptic feel, and angular feedback. This technology offers surgeons tools with greater degrees of freedom and this technology can be expanded beyond the screwdriver to different surgical tools and other medical procedures. The technology for screw placement in surgery is limited and relies on fixed screw delivery or difficult to control variable angle screwdrivers that offer a maximum range of 45. Increased angular range for screw delivery improves a surgeon's ability to minimize the initial incision size, as well as decreasing the likelihood of expanding that incision or making secondary stab incisions. Increased incision size is associated with higher patient pain, increased likelihood of surgical site infections, and poorer patient outcomes. Moreover, the variable angle screwdrivers on the market cannot pair with neuronavigation to provide real time visual and quantitative feedback of location in the body. This screwdriver technology offers surgeons the ability to select the ideal angle of screw placement without sacrificing the reliability or stability of screw delivery.

Networks of satellites are used to predict natural disasters more accurately, provide better communication, and guide autonomous vehicles as well as for many other applications of global interest. Profitable missions need a propulsion system to perform orbital maneuvers, such as final orbit insertion, attitude control for precision pointing, and drag compensation to extend the lifetime of the mission or deorbit the satellite at the end of the mission, a requirement that will soon be enforced to ensure space sustainability. There are very few propulsion systems available for micro satellites (satellites under 100 kg). Electrospray thrusters, unlike other electric propulsion systems, can operate efficiently with only a few watts of power, which makes them very suitable for microsatellites (under 100 kg). At the same time, the same system can be scaled up and used for larger satellites (100-400 kg). The industry is shifting to serial manufacturing and a fast-paced, low-cost oriented vision to fulfill the demand. This technology has the potential to meet the strict time, cost, size. and performance requirements.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an electric propulsion system for small satellites. The system will provide the spacecraft with primary propulsion and attitude control to perform a wide range of orbital maneuvers. The modular approach ensures a fit with the new space industry, where constellations of satellites require systems that can be easily integrated into their platforms and that meet the low-cost and quick time requirements. Electrospray thrusters accelerate droplets and ions through an electric field, producing thrust. The thrust produced by one emitter is very low, in the order of 0.5 N, therefore, hundreds of emitters must operate simultaneously to provide enough thrust to perform orbital maneuvers. This project develops a process to manufacture arrays of emitters using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. The emitter arrays can be arranged in modules of arbitrary sizes to meet specific thrust requirements and benefit from the advantages of MEMS manufacturing. These emitters are internally wetted, which means that the propellant flows through a capillary and it is anchored at the emitter head during operation, a desirable feature that is not found in other types of electrospray emitters, such as porous emitters or externally wetted emitters. This design may have better performances than other approaches because the emitters are coupled with a network of microfluidic channels that provide the necessary hydraulic resistance for correct operation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Creation of herbicides which are effective, naturally produced, scalable, and deployed using the current agronomic practices could alter the foundations of crop production in the United States and around the world. In view of the projected 8% annual increase in global food and agriculture market, shrinking areas under cultivation that lead to the need for higher productivity per acre, and increasing demand for nutritional food items, the need for sustainable alternatives to current synthetic herbicides that do not promote herbicide resistant weeds is becoming clearer. Widespread adoption of the proposed technology is expected to benefit farmers and crop producers reducing societal strain, financial burden, and environmental stress from crop losses due to herbicide resistant weeds by eliminating these weeds through an environmentally safe method, without the use of excess fuel, time, equipment, and synthetic herbicides.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is in developing a novel natural herbicide product that, when applied to herbicide resistant weeds, will cause seed or plant cell's membranes to degrade and lose integrity. Thus, the novel product is intended to work both as pre-emergent weed prevention and post-emergent weed control herbicide. The product will be an environmentally safe blend of natural plant extracts and excipients. The herbicide formulations will be sprayable onto soil or onto plant leaves and stems. The cost and time needed to initially screen herbicide rates, outcomes, and best practices typically is many years. The greenhouse screening approach takes months and provides valuable information to ensure that field trials, which are more expensive and impacted by changes in weather, are efficient in cost and outcomes. This project will initially focus on greenhouse validation of weed control of the most resistant weeds known in different geographical locations in the U.S. Dose response data for 50%-to-90% inhibition control/efficacy of herbicide resistant weeds will provide the information to develop a herbicide use label, directions for best practices, and good stewardship by using only the amount of herbicide needed for control without overuse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, early career teachers need support during their first years of teaching to be successful and help them stay in the profession. This project aims to provide in-service and beginning elementary school teachers increased opportunities to refine their mathematics teaching to support minoritized youth in racially diverse rural communities in Georgia that have less access to elementary mathematics specialists. This project follows and supports both beginning teachers (BTs) and elementary mathematics coaches (EMCs) over 5 years to develop and refine their mathematics teaching and coaching, respectively, using equity-based tools to guide reflection and conversations about both the BTs? instructional practices and the EMCs? coaching practices. The tools provide data to uncover biases and aspirational pedagogical targets for equitable discourse and task design. The goals of the project include: a) establishing a virtual distance learning community to support equity focused elementary mathematics coaches across rural counties in Georgia, b) developing and refining a fully online elementary mathematics and coaching graduate coursework sequence to prepare EMCs, and c) implementing an innovative model of university supervision and induction for BTs.<br/><br/>Over the 5-year period, ten EMCs will engage in coursework, and be supported through a virtual community to develop elementary mathematics teaching and learning in their schools and districts. The coaches will support at least ten beginning teachers to develop equitable mathematics learning communities as they enter the field during their first years of teaching. This approach is important because formalized induction support is rare in most districts in Georgia, and teachers are leaving the field in record numbers because they feel unprepared. Data sources will include videos of teaching episodes, teacher reflections, narrative interviews, and document analysis. The study will employ case study and narrative methodologies in analyzing the varied and rich data collected with BTs and EMCs. The project?s goal of preparing and supporting EMCs has potential to dramatically shift the professional development of BTs, and to re-professionalize teacher education and provide more equitable mathematics education for all students. This proposed study could serve as a model to build additional networks of STEM coaches across rural areas.<br/><br/>The award is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One broad impact of the proposed project is to make a paradigm shift in the noise, vibration, comfort of vehicles. This technology is a meta-surface which can be used to control and isolate sound generated by a moving car. The proposed acoustic metamaterial partially fills the interior of the tires, thus isolating them acoustically from the car cabin. The proposed design significantly reduces the noise arising from tire-pavement interaction at a wide range of vehicle speeds over acoustic frequencies below 2 kHz. Robust lightweight meta-structures provide substantial interior noise reduction and a comfortable driving experience without affecting tire performance. Considering the growing automotive market size, the proposed technology can be a catalyst for economic growth both locally and globally. The proposed quiet technology can help solve the existing environmental noise pollution in other fields and may, ultimately, have long-term impacts on health including anxiety, depression, and heart diseases.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of automotive vehicle noise pollution reduction technology. This noise often comes from tire-pavement interaction, e.g., friction and impact. Currently efforts aim to use sound absorbers and/or cavity resonators to suppress peaks in the noise spectrum. The tools applied to reach this goal are acoustic foams and Helmholtz resonators. However, these noise reduction methods are focused on suppression of the tire cavity resonance, and they are effective within a relatively narrow bandwidth. A different approach is necessary for better noise reduction of the sound generated at low frequency and the wideband noise caused by tire-pavement interaction. While it is difficult to deal with the low frequency and undesired broadband sound using conventional materials due to the limited design constraints, this project will use acoustic metamaterials and artificially engineered structures that can have a compact shape while providing exotic acoustic properties. The proposed approach uses an artificially designed, reflecting acoustic can be extended to other objects generating low-frequency mechanical noise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Obesity among American adults has risen from 12% in 1990 to over 40% today, leading to an estimated medical cost of $260 billion in 2016, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). According to the National Institute for Health (NIH), 70% of American adults were overweight or obese in 2014. In 2013, American adults were spending $60 billion annually on weight loss, according to US News & World Report. A 2008 American Journal of Preventive Medicine study showed that those who kept daily food journals lost twice as much weight as those who did not. However, existing diet tracking methods are often too time-consuming for maintaining long-term weight loss. A personalized artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot could make food logging fun and easy, benefitting millions of Americans who are trying to lose weight and furthering knowledge on spoken dialogue systems.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance knowledge in the field of spoken dialogue systems in several ways. First, the project establishes a new research area by noting that AI and spoken dialogue systems have yet to be applied to nutrition. Typically, conversational agents focus on factual question answering or tasks such as flight booking, but there is an opportunity to leverage big data for learning relationships between diet and health. Second, this project will develop a neural generative chatbot model with memory, demonstrating the benefit of personalized conversational interactions with intelligent agents that remember the history of conversations and personal details about the user. While manually writing chatbot responses ensures more control over the output, the drawback is that the responses are less interesting, diverse, and flexible. This work proposes generative Transformers in order to generate more realistic, human-like responses and knowledge graphs as a novel method for remembering the conversation and diet tracking history of each user for personalized feedback. Finally, this project proposes the application of causal inference, often used for medical diagnosis, to the new, challenging task of predicting which foods lead to outcomes such as gut symptoms, weight loss, or muscle building.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current commercial large-scale carbon capture technologies (amine scrubbing and calcium looping) have a high operational cost of $50/ton or higher. Emerging carbon capture technologies such as metal organic framework and composite sorbent generally do not possess the mechanical properties such as crush resistance required for megaton-scale deployment. The proposed technology is designed to achieve megaton-scale carbon capture with an estimated operational cost of $30/ton. This is a deep technology innovation that works with an industrially-proven subscription model. The proposed technology will reduce the emissions when the powerplant does not already have a carbon capture unit, and reduce the cost if the power plant already has an existing carbon capture unit.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of development of granular metal carbonate (GMC) as a single-ingredient solid adsorbent for point-source carbon dioxide (CO2) capture. Abrased GMC particles are recycled through granulation. The recyclability of GMC limits the waste of sorbent while maintaining a low heat capacity, achieving the lowest cost per ton of CO2 captured. The proposed technology may remove >90% of the CO2 from flue gases containing 5%-40% CO2 in humid and dry environments. This approach leverages the high CO2 concentration in the flue gas (>5%) and excess heat to achieve economical carbon capture with a small footprint (<10% of the plant?s surface area).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Seismic observations show significant variations in both wave speeds and anisotropy, indicative of poor mixing of different rock types. One of the most important materials that may be responsible for these observations is calcium silicate perovskite, or CaSiO3. It is not only a major component of the ambient lower mantle, but also an important phase in the surface crustal materials that are transported into the lower mantle. Thus, estimating the amount of CaSiO3 throughout the Earth?s lower mantle can elucidate the material exchange process between the Earth?s interior and the surface. This requires measurement of the wave speeds through this mineral as a function of direction and minor element composition, which is the focus of this project. This work will also enable PI Zhang and her research group to develop a seminar course at Texas A&M University focusing on modern synchrotron experimental techniques used to the Earth and other planets from the surface to the interior. No similar class has been offered at Texas A&M University, and such class will open enable research opportunities for students, bringing potential users to synchrotron facilities, and training the next-generation researchers and scientists in US. High school students from underrepresented groups will be recruited to work with PI on research projects, promoting diversity of the geoscience community.<br/><br/>This project will evaluate CaSiO3 perovskite (davemaoite, Ca-pv) as the potential candidate for explaining the observed seismic anisotropy and heterogeneities in the Earth?s lower mantle. The thermoelastic properties of cubic and tetragonal Ca-pv will be measured through Brillouin spectroscopy methods combined with diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the unquenchable nature of Ca-pv and the poor coupling between CaSiO3 and Nd:YAG laser with the 1024 nm wavelength, the sample will be synthesized in-situ using the CO2 laser heating method. Equation of state of Ca-pv will be determined using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Utilizing the better constrained thermoelastic properties of cubic and tetragonal Ca-pv, PI Zhang and her group will evaluate the role of Ca-pv in the observed seismic heterogeneities in the lower mantle, as well as estimate the seismic anisotropy produced by Ca-pv after combining with textural measurements of Ca-pv.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conducting successful research cruises on these ships requires scientists (particularly those in supervisory roles on the survey trips ? or ?chief scientists?) to understand the planning and logistics of how to request time on ships, how to coordinate personnel and equipment, how to plan for operations and survey tasks at sea, and how to work with vessel crew and staff ? as well as how to deal with unexpected issues which may arise. To maintain a robust scientific workforce that can effectively request, plan, and lead this type of work, early career scientists need to gain training and experience, with consideration for the unique challenges of work the Arctic, such as planning survey routes through sea ice. There is a particular need for this training and capacity-building at the present time, given increasing interest in Arctic research and a lag in research cruises (and thus junior scientist training) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project will host up to 12 early career participants on a week-long R/V Sikuliaq transit between Seward and Nome, AK. Participants will participate in virtual pre-cruise meetings, a one-day pre-cruise workshop, and diverse training modules on the cruise to develop proficiency, build confidence, and become part of an early career arctic oceanographer cohort. <br/><br/>This project will implement an early career chief scientist training cruise onboard the R/V Sikuliaq in Alaskan waters to help train a new generation of oceanographers who have the skills and confidence to lead these types of expeditions. Participants will be recruited through an advertisement process and will be introduced to the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF), the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and cruise planning and logistics through several virtual pre-cruise meetings prior to the training cruise. Participants will have the opportunity to plan their cruise sampling, communicate plans with the vessel crew, and arrange for mobilization of any required supplies. Topics will include strategies for using the Marine Facilities Planning system and the Cruise Planning workflow, learning how to request and use resources from the UNOLS van pool and other community-based vessel equipment and support groups, and how to coordinate and manage shipboard and shore-based personnel. During a pre-cruise one-day shoreside workshop, participants will engage in targeted activities to build leadership and explore interpersonal dynamics prior to boarding. During the cruise, science mentors and vessel scientific staff will provide guidance to participants and lead a series of presentations and group discussions about how to manage a successful marine survey. Participants will have the opportunity to engage in sampling and daily activity planning. After the cruise, participants will ship any samples collected to their home institution, archive data, and create a cruise report. Specific desired outcomes include developing a well-trained seagoing scientific workforce to promote U.S. national interests in the Arctic through oceanographic research on NSF-supported platforms. The project will help to develop a cohort of early career researchers who can become future mentors among the polar science community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CESM includes a full representation of the earth's climate system, including component models for the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, sea ice, and ice sheets.  Earth system models like CESM simulate wind, temperature, humidity, and other atmospheric variables on grids in which the grid spacing is too coarse (generally at least 15km) to simulate convection, meaning the overturning atmospheric motions seen in thunderstorms.  While it is very difficult to simulate the full range of convective motions, models with grid spacings of a few kilometers (say 3km) are able to simulate the evolution of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), the large thunderstorm systems that occur over the central US and in other parts of the world.  Thus there is interest in developing configurations of CESM with the necessary high resolution and enhanced dynamics and physics required to enable simulation of MCSs and other forms of organized convection.  The workshop brings together model developers and users who are interested in the development and use of such configurations.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the workshop come from the desirability of models which are better able to represent weather and climate processes that have substantial impacts on human activities.  For instance much of the extreme precipitation in the US comes from MCSs, which are also responsible for hailstorms and tornado outbreaks.  More specifically, the workshop benefits the broad community of users and developers of CESM, which is the only earth system developed by and for the global climate research community.

To achieve this aim, a five-day virtual conference for two-year college (2YC) geoscience faculty will be held to advance knowledge about improving 2YC student success and becoming a faculty change agent. The conference will be led by individuals who have (1) served as faculty leaders (change agents) on their campuses and in their regions; (2) written articles in ?Catalyzing Change: STEM Faculty as Change Agents? (Baer, Layou, & Macdonald, 2022), a volume of New Directions for Community Colleges, about their work as change agents; and (3) written funded grant proposals. This professional development experience will prompt faculty to consider how to improve their teaching, strategies for inclusion, and student mentoring skills. These changes will enhance the recruitment, retention, and support of STEM students at 2YCs. This conference will also address barriers to 2YC faculty involvement in NSF proposal conception and creation, and provide support, feedback, and time for participants who wish to develop grant proposals. Increased 2YC faculty participation in federal grants could have a tremendous impact on the recruitment and retention of a diverse group of STEM workers as many students at 2YCs are members of groups historically underrepresented in STEM.<br/> <br/>Project leaders will convene a five-day virtual conference for 2YC geoscience faculty using articles from ?Catalyzing Change,? most of which were authored by 2YC faculty who have led faculty professional development in the context of the SAGE 2YC (Supporting and Advancing Geoscience Education at Two-Year Colleges) program and/or have experience with funded grant proposals. Conference sessions ? led by ?Catalyzing Change? chapter authors ? on effective teaching and student learning; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and supporting students? career and transfer paths will disseminate the content of the ?Catalyzing Change? articles and aid participants in formulating ideas for future work as faculty agents of change and grant proposal authors. The interactive format of the conference will aid a diverse group of participants, many of whom may be new to leading faculty professional development and/or writing grant proposals in the past, in formulating ideas for moving their work forward on their campuses and developing individual or collaborative NSF proposals. The goals of the project are to grow the existing community of 2YC faculty change agents across the country, continue to advance the goals of the SAGE 2YC project, and encourage increased 2YC geoscience faculty participation in the submission of NSF and other grant proposals.

Over the past two decades, the United States drug shortages have become an unwelcome reality with public health and national security implications. In a recent survey of 719 health system pharmacists, all reported experiencing drug shortages in the preceding year with 52% of the shortages involving LVPS. The main mitigation strategy, reported by 81% of the respondents, was the hoarding of available supply. Current strategies to mitigate drug shortages are mostly focused on reaction and recovery rather than preparedness. There is a critical need for an alternative pharmaceutical supply for LVPS that ensures long-term resilience. Beyond shortages, the technology has the potential to generate vital solutions in disaster situations, in military/war zones, in low-resource settings, or other settings where a modular solution is needed and clean rooms are not available. The project will also provide opportunities for the lead graduate student to participate in student pitch competitions, a value proposition design course, leadership seminars, and regular check-ins with the team?s commercialization and regulatory experts.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project is a technological innovation that generates water-for-injection (WFI) near the point of care, in hospitals and pharmacies, mixes the WFI with concentrates and performs aseptic, pyrogen-free packaging within built-in environmental contamination controls, eliminating the need for use in a cleanroom facility. Most LVPS are over 95% water for injection (WFI) by volume, so the proposed innovation significantly reduces the cost and energy associated with shipping ?water? around the world. This PFI-TT award will enable the implementation of the first full system proof-of-concept prototype, capable of on-demand, hospital/pharmacy-scale (100 L/h) production of LVPS and validation of the system?s ability to meet composition and microbiological stability requirements in a non-clean room environment. The aims of the project include finalizing the design of the primary water treatment train to meet regulations and to reduce risk of biological contamination and demonstrating full-system feasibility to meet production rate, composition, and microbiological stability success criteria. Feasibility will be demonstrated by integrating and validating all three modules in the production of one representative LVPS, Dianeal PD-2 with 2.5% Dextrose, a common peritoneal dialysis prescription selected following 140+ customer discovery interviews.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This metabolic allocation is of major importance in determining the nutritional quality of plant seeds, which fundamentally affects the ability of the seed to act as the propagule and is also of major importance to agricultural production of food, feed and bio-based feedstocks. The Arabidopsis QQS (Qua-Quine Starch, At3g30720) gene has the potential of being a universal novel regulator of C and N allocation to the assembly of proteins and carbohydrates. QQS is archetypal of a class of ?orphan? genes that shares no sequence homology in any other species and is exemplary of the ?dark-genome?. When QQS is expressed in crops, it increases protein and decreases starch content. QQS physically interacts with the C4 subunit of the trimeric Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) that regulates eukaryotic transcription. The broader impacts of the project include the intrinsic nature of the research, which could provide a major breakthrough in our ability to systematically direct metabolism towards the production of food and feed, and biorenewable resources. In addition, the project will provide excellent projects for postdoctoral researchers, graduate, undergraduate and high/middle/elementary school students and education of plant biotechnology in Mississippi, accessible inter-disciplinary training to increase student exposure to biology early, and to increase the number of early career researchers who may spur innovation in STEM research. <br/><br/>The overall research goal is to identify and expand the novel regulatory network that enables QQS to control protein and carbohydrate composition in plants. The overarching hypothesis is that protein-coding orphan genes, which have evolutionarily only recently emerged (e.g., QQS), can be selected and maintained in evolution by acting on existing metabolic networks to mediate responses that confer selective advantages. This research proposes to elucidate the regulatory network that QQS disrupts, which impacts the metabolic network determining protein and carbohydrate content. This research will provide a paradigm for understanding how an orphan gene can be integrated into established genetic and biochemical networks and spur the rapid acquisition of novel traits. Specifically, the QQS protein interacts with NF-YC4 regulatory complex, affecting the C and N partitioning between starch and protein reserves. This attribute is transgenically transferable across species barriers and has the potential to regulate plant reserves to the benefit of human consumption. Moreover, the QQS gene offers unique opportunities to fundamentally understand the intersection between genetic and metabolic networks regulating one of the most important traits in agriculture: seed composition determinants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

About 70% of U.S. drinking water comes from surface waters, including the tidal fresh regions of estuaries. Drought, sea level rise, watershed and port & harbor engineering, and changes in land-use are increasingly threatening such water supplies in coastal regions due to increasing risk of salinization. The risk extends to water extraction from the coastal zones for thermoelectric power, irrigation, and industrial production. This project will bring together an interdisciplinary team of researchers and stakeholders to assess the risks of salt contamination of water supplies in tidal rivers, synthesize the current understanding and identify knowledge gaps. A better understanding of climatic and other anthropogenic effects on the water supplies will be valuable for bolstering the resilience of water infrastructure and protecting public health.<br/><br/>A series of virtual web panels and an in-person workshop will be organized to assess the science on this emerging topic. Case studies of saltwater intrusion and freshwater salinization in tidal rivers in the US and around the world will be discussed and synthesized. The workshop will bring together national and international communities of diverse researchers working on the interdisciplinary aspects of salt contamination of water supplies in tidal rivers, involving senior and early-career scientists, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. The workshop will include outreach activities through engagement with stakeholders involved in water management, conservation, drinking water treatment operations, and will include participants from the agricultural, industrial, municipal and power generation sectors that rely on access to freshwater sources. The overall goals are twofold: (1) publish a systematic review paper to synthesize current understanding of this interdisciplinary topic and identify major knowledge gaps; (2) produce a forward-looking workshop report to create a research vision and guide future research activities on salt contamination of water supplies in coastal zones.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Physical Oceanography programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When nanoparticles are injected into the bloodstream, they encounter a rich environment, replete with diverse kinds of cells and proteins. Dr. Eden Tanner and her team at the University of Mississippi have developed an ionic liquid nanoparticle coating technology which enables selective in situ ?hitchhiking? of nanoparticles onto different kinds of blood cells. This CAREER project will investigate this phenomenon to understand why and how this hitchhiking occurs, what impact it has on the cell membranes, and measure the strength of the forces between the nanoparticle and the cell membrane. This research project will provide critical fundamental knowledge on the interaction of charged materials with components of the bloodstream. Supported by Dr. Tanner and her lab, the student participants will be recruited from the Increasing Minority Access to Graduate Education Rising Science Star Program. These cohorts of Mississippi-based African American undergraduate scholars will be intensively mentored and supported from their first day of college until graduation and beyond, preparing them to enter graduate school and for careers as scientific leaders. Participants will work with the PI to return to their high schools to deliver outreach activities, thereby creating a robust, supportive pipeline of scientists and ultimately diversifying the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER program is to interrogate the interactions between ionic liquid-coated nanoparticles and blood components. The Tanner lab at the University of Mississippi has demonstrated that successful surface modification of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles with a choline carboxylic acid-based ionic liquid results in preferential adhesion of the ionic liquid-nanoparticles to different blood components in whole blood. A key innovation will be determining the dynamics and mechanisms of adhesion of the ionic liquid-polymeric nanoparticle composites onto blood cell surfaces. The project will consist of the following three objectives: advance knowledge on the mechanism of attachment between the ionic liquid-nanoparticles and the cell membrane (Objective 1), assess the impact of the hitchhiking on the cell membrane (Objective 2), and measure the strength of the attractive forces and the effect of hitchhiking on adhesion to the blood vessel wall (Objective 3).  The PI will use a host of analytical techniques to accomplish these objectives, including molecular dynamics simulations, optical tweezers, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and small angle X-ray scattering. The educational objective of this CAREER program is the establishment of the Increasing Minority Access to Graduate Education Rising Science Star Program, an intensive mentoring program that immerses cohorts of Mississippi?s African American Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics students in research from their first day of college until their last (3 participants a year, 15 total). Partnering with the existing National Science Foundation-funded Increasing Minority Access to Graduate Education program, the project?s educational approach will provide the Rising Science Star Scholars with a high degree of social, financial and academic support, paving their path to graduate school and a scientific career.

A portion of this charred material is dissolved upon interaction with water and is carried away from soils to rivers as dissolved black carbon (DBC). A warmer and drier climate has led to increased wildfire activity in Arctic regions and it is unknown how these changes will affect the amount of DBC in rivers and its fate in the coastal environment. In the summer of 2022, the Apoon Pass and East Fork Fires burned >255,000 acres in the Yukon River Delta (Alaska, USA), part of a trend towards larger and more frequent wildfires in the Delta in recent years. The main goal of this project is to determine whether recent wildfire activity in the Delta leads to increased amounts of DBC along the Yukon River and estuary to the coastal Arctic Ocean. Results of this work will lay the groundwork for future, large-scale studies on fire-derived carbon in vulnerable Arctic watersheds. This project will support collaboration among two early career researchers and one graduate student with guidance from an experienced Arctic investigator.<br/><br/>Pan-Arctic watersheds are experiencing increased fire activity as a result of climate change. The cumulative effects of wildfire (charcoal production, soil destabilization, change in hydrologic flow paths) on carbon export in major Arctic rivers is currently unknown. This project will determine whether large, recent wildfires within the Yukon River Delta have changed the distribution, composition, and total export of DBC along the Yukon River-to-Arctic Ocean continuum. To achieve this goal, new samples will be collected during the 2023 spring freshet and results compared to those obtained from archived 2019 freshet samples. We will employ a combination of molecular marker, stable carbon isotope, and ultrahigh resolution mass spectral techniques to evaluate wildfire-DBC relationships in the Yukon River Delta between low-fire (2019; ~10,000 acres burned) and high-fire (2023; >255,000 acres burned) years. This work builds upon other efforts to predict the effects of climate change on carbon cycling in Arctic-boreal landscapes and will assist in answering broad research questions regarding the behavior of DBC in intermediate reservoirs and fate of terrestrial organic matter in the coastal ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More generally, matrix inequalities are of great importance in engineering and other applications, since the stability of a system can often be expressed in terms of a complex set of matrix inequalities. The mathematical discipline of matrix analysis can be used to simplify or better understand questions about such inequalities. This project will continue the development of the systematic manipulation of matrix inequalities and study related mathematical questions in several complex variables, many of which are of independent theoretical interest. This project will also explore potential applications outside mathematics, including applications to engineering and economics, such as a search for unstable equilibria in models of trade restrictions, which may inform trade policy.<br/> <br/>A matrix inequality establishes the positivity of the eigenvalues of an expression involving some matrices. For example, matrix inequalities arise in the stability analysis of systems of ordinary differential equations where a matrix solution to the Lyapunov condition is needed. This project will contribute to the mathematical foundations of systematic algebraic and analytic manipulation for matrix inequalities. Recent development of the subject has concerned the study of free noncommutative functions, the natural class of functions used to perform such manipulations in a dimension-free way. A qualitative understanding of the free noncommutative functional calculus is important for applications; it is a tool to work around the fact that matrix calculations, such as inversion and multiplication, are computationally expensive and sometimes unstable. Much of the study applies techniques developed in systems and control engineering, such as realization theory and sums of squares, whose mathematical theory is currently undergoing a rapid development. This project is also concerned with the boundary behavior of analytic functions, which has played an important role in the manipulation of matrix inequalities and moment theory since the classical work of Nevanlinna and Loewner.

Additionally, they are commonly utilized in laboratory mesocosms to study impacts of ocean acidification. The key enabling technology for the DuraFET is an Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET) semiconductor chip, manufactured by Honeywell Co. The Honeywell ISFET has several unique features that give it superior performance relative to its competitors.

First, the performance of a commercially available optical pH optode sensor (distributed by PyroScience) will be assessed. This is a relatively new sensor for oceanography, thus its performance has not been thoroughly characterized to the satisfaction of chemical oceanographers. Second, a pH sensor that utilizes an ISFET from a different supplier will be developed. Both pH sensors that will be explored are solid state, small, and low-power, making them good candidates for autonomous platforms. The sensors will be thoroughly characterized in the laboratory for pH response, long term drift, salinity, temperature, and pressure effects, response time, and hysteresis. Both sensors will then be deployed on coastal moorings, underwater gliders, and profiling floats to assess in situ performance across a range of conditions over months to years.

In 2020, the total cost of cancer care was nearly $210 billion. Due to the nature of current cancer diagnostics, most cancers are diagnosed and treated during late-stages. This results in a large economic burden to patients, families, healthcare providers, and facilities. To advance the health and welfare of the public and reduce the nation?s healthcare burden, there is a need for cancer screening, diagnostic, and monitoring devices that are non-invasive, cost-effective, easy-to-use, and accurate. The proposed platform for the early detection of multiple types of epithelial cancers 1) addresses the lack of effective non-invasive portable screening devices; 2) provides faster, more discriminatory assessments in near real-time; 3) yields the most precise and accurate results to identify cancers earlier, when interventions are more impactful, less expensive, less invasive, and more likely to improve patient outcomes.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to establish the feasibility of developing the first portable, programmable, single cell cytology platform for early detection of multiple types of epithelial cancers, suitable for use at the point-of-care. The proposed technology will uniquely combine microfluidics and artificial intelligence (AI) to act as a sensor and provide predictive analysis, allowing for the accurate classification of potentially cancerous tissue. The platform will support near real-time, multiparameter, single-cell cytology measurements and will provide a method for automated analysis of a plurality of key metrics. Proof of concept has been established for the application area of oral cavity cancers, with the approach demonstrating superior performance metrics compared to other diagnostics (tissue reflectance, tissue auto fluorescence, salivary testing, and cytology testing). It is the only adjunct that can distinguish between mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia. The key objectives for this project are to develop methodologies to link different clinical specimen types to the microfluidics environment, and a biomarker discovery process to identify biomarkers for different applications that are amenable to the platform. The successful completion of this project will enable the platform to recognize and assess various levels of dysplasia across multiple epithelial cancer types.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the climate warms, melting ice at the surface of ice sheets form ponds of meltwater. In order to have an impact on the movement of the Greenland Ice Sheet, the meltwater must reach and lubricate the bottom of the ice sheet. For example, lakes on the surface of the ice sheet can drain through cracks and reach the bottom of the ice sheet within a few hours. To understand the formation of these cracks and the cause of draining lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet, we plan to use deep learning, an artificial intelligence algorithm, to find the locations of cracks and draining lakes in satellite imagery. Based on this new dataset, we will use mathematical models to understand the formation of new cracks and their impact on the movement of the ice sheet. Our approach contains an exciting mix of observations and mathematical models. The ability to use artificial intelligence to detect cracks and draining lakes offers opportunities to drive new understandings at the ice-sheet scale. Broader Impacts: This project will support (1) a US-UK collaboration; (2) students and junior scientists; (3) the development of open-source artificial intelligence codes for the Arctic sciences community; (4) the production of a comprehensive and freely available database of the Greenland Ice Sheet cracks and draining lakes; and (5) a community-led mentoring program called COMPACT (COmmunity-led Mentoring Program for Advancing Cryosphere Trainees), which will facilitate multi-mentor networks within the US and UK cryospheric communities for minority doctoral students. Overall, this research will help us understand how ice sheets respond to a changing climate.<br/><br/>Meltwater that forms on the surface of the ice sheet can seep through moulins and fractures that connect the surface to the bed, lubricating the bottom of the ice sheet and influencing its dynamics. Surface-to-bed meltwater pathways are prevalent across the Greenland Ice Sheet. However, we currently lack the continent-wide maps of moulins, crevasses, and draining lakes needed to understand the formation of surface-to-bed meltwater pathways. Utilizing deep learning techniques for automated detection and mapping of ice sheet surface features can greatly enhance the glaciology community's capacity to analyze high-resolution satellite imagery, leading to new discoveries. By harnessing deep neural networks, this project aims to generate continent-wide databases of surface features that can be used to mechanistically model the ice sheet conditions that create new surface-to-bed pathways and their impact on ice-sheet dynamics. The ability to scale up feature detection to the ice sheet scale can enrich both remote sensing and modeling communities. This project will foster a US-UK collaboration involving junior principal investigators, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students. The project aims to develop open-source deep learning code, remote-sensing algorithms, and subglacial hydrology model code for the broader glaciological community. The resulting database of Greenland Ice Sheet surface-to-bed pathway locations and supraglacial lake drainage dates and locations will be made open source. The principal investigators will also collaborate to establish a community-led mentoring program within the US and UK cryospheric community to promote the retention of underrepresented doctoral students and junior faculty/scientists. The societal benefit of this research will be a better understanding of ice sheet processes and an improved ability to predict ice sheet change in a warming climate. Understanding the evolving hydrology of the Greenland Ice Sheet remains an important topic given the unknown, but potentially significant, role that meltwater drainage via hydro-fracture may play in the ice-sheet?s dynamic response to an expanding ablation area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to understand the physiological response of mixotrophs exposed to micronutrient limitation in the Southern Ocean, specifically iron, manganese and simultaneous limitation of more than one trace metal, or colimitation. Such environmental conditions are characteristic of the Southern Ocean and can only be tested with local algae. The Principal Investigators hypothesize that under trace metal colimitation, some mixotrophs will have a competitive advantage by increasing their ability to consume particles to obtain energy and trace metals from their prey. Given the lack of understanding of how mixotrophs have adapted to the micronutrient limitation, the researchers propose studies with microalgal cultures isolated from the Southern Ocean; they will measure growth responses, consumption behavior, changes in cellular chemistry and transcription of genetic material in response to iron and manganese limitation. This project benefits the National Science Foundation goals of understanding Life in Antarctica and adaptation of organisms to this extreme environment.

Such cells may lower the costs of mammalian cell-based manufacturing, which is used in the synthesis of products that are critical to modern medicine such as biologics and cellular therapies as well as in the manufacturing of products that may reduce the carbon footprint of global agriculture such as cultivated meat.  For example, cost parity of cultivated meat with conventional meat is not attainable with current technologies as over 95% of the cost of cultivated meat comes from the cost of adding recombinantly-produced growth factors to the culture medium to promote cell proliferation.  Mammalian cells grown for cultured meat may be engineered to produce their own growth factors to reduce cost.  Genetically engineering resilience in mammalian cells has the potential to bring the cost of performing large-scale mammalian cell culture down to a fraction of present-day cost.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a genetic engineering platform for mammalian cell programming.  State-of-the-art technologies enable DNA writing into mammalian genomes at only the 10,000 base-pair scale.

This application includes the financial services, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, transportation, and chemicals industries. Quantum computing is still at its infancy and the current device capabilities do not allow customers to adequately test the potential of incorporating quantum algorithms into their business. The hybrid platform fundamentally increases the computing capabilities of such industries to establish a better understanding of the use cases and the extent to which quantum computing improves their bottom line. This technology enables quantum hardware providers to offer more services to their customers. In fact, most major quantum hardware providers are also major classical cloud computing providers. This technology serves as the bridge between the existing classical infrastructure and the emerging quantum stack. The bottleneck cost for quantum computing is the hardware development cost. This technology is a low-cost, high-impact solution to significantly scale quantum services.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of technology that helps bridge the gap between quantum computing needs and the existing, insufficient solutions used to run quantum algorithms. Quantum computing has been proposed as a new paradigm that has the potential to offer computing advantages over the classical computing paradigm. However, the two existing solutions to execute quantum algorithms suffer from apparent challenges. First, simulations of quantum algorithms using classical computers do not scale. Second, quantum computers must satisfy highly demanding hardware size and quality requirements to support practical applications. This technology is a software toolchain that combines quantum and classical computing into a concerted computing platform. The 3-step process consists of (1) cutting a large quantum program into smaller pieces, (2) running the smaller pieces with quantum computers, and (3) reconstructing the results using classical high-performance computers. Overall, the technology leverages classical tensor network techniques and quantum computing to enable the execution of quantum programs significantly beyond the capabilities of the existing stand-alone solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Faculty mentors will lead in a series of open ended mathematical research projects ten undergraduate participants and two experienced peer mentors each summer of three years for nine weeks. The research projects chosen for the students are contemporary; difficult but tractable; of interest to the wider mathematical community; in areas of research actively investigated by leading researchers supported by NSF; and usually lead to more questions with every new result. Whereas the investigations often result in publications in peer reviewed journals, the site provides an experience akin to what students would encounter in a research career. Demographically, participants reflect the diversity of the nation?s workforce pool:   The selected student groups are at least 50% female; at least 40% from underrepresented groups; at least 40% first generation college attendees; and at least 50% from schools with limited undergraduate research opportunities. Students are carefully mentored and taken ?from a relatively dependent status to as independent a status as their competence warrants? (nsf19852). The program takes place in Ponce, Puerto Rico; offers a bilingual research environment; and builds a rich Hispanic research community from both Latinos in the U.S. and Latinos in Puerto Rico, creating a familiar environment for Hispanic students and preparing students from Puerto Rico for graduate studies life in mainland U.S. The REU has a strong peer mentorship aspect provided by experienced peer mentors who have already been successful in dealing with previous REU?s research projects and in navigating the difficulties in undergraduate studies.<br/><br/>Research areas include algebraic coding theory, probabilistic combinatorics, discrete geometry, and classical combinatorics. Students may use (a) deep methods in discrete combinatorial probability, and (b) classical combinatorics -- in tandem with classical analysis (inequalities, asymptotic analysis etc.). The concept of concentration of measure continues to be at the intellectual focus of several of the students' research activities. Projects in the combinatorics of parking functions are also offered. These begin with classical enumerative techniques, and based on student background and interest, further explore problems related to hyperplanes arrangements, partially ordered sets, Young tableaux, and discrete geometry. Students will use programming to uncover patterns and formulate conjectures leading to proofs of results in the area. In projects related to Coding Theory students might improve bounds on parameters of difference classes of binary Goppa codes, might improve on existing encoding and decoding algorithms of algebraic geometry codes, find bounds on the parameters of Polar Grassmann codes, or use linear codes in applications to DNA barcoding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

REPL?s focus is to provide these opportunities especially to those underrepresented in the programming languages research community. Between 2012-2018, the Computing Research Association (CRA) Taulbee survey shows only 4.9% of PhD students in computer science who study programming languages and compilers are domestic underrepresented students. REPL is the first REU (NSF or otherwise) designed for underrepresented students with focus on programming languages.  Programming languages themselves are the basic tools by which all modern software is constructed, so studying how to improve the reliability, quality, and performance of programming languages is essential to modern computing systems.<br/><br/>REPL research focuses on fundamental questions concerning the correctness of computation. How do we specify and prove the correctness of a program? And how do we make these methods scale to large systems? From 2015-2022, PLClub faculty Steve Zdancewic, Benjamin Pierce, and Stephanie Weirich co-led an NSF Expedition in Computing on these questions that explored the ?Science of Deep Specification.? Among other things, the expedition helped us reason about the Haskell programming language, LLVM compiler optimizations, web servers, and even the correctness of a lightbulb controller, yet much is left to do. Lightbulb control software, like much software we use daily, seems simple, but fully specifying and proving that it behaves correctly is not.

One aim is to increase the use of renewable electricity in the chemical and energy industries.  A major hurdle is the lack of efficient electrocatalysts that enable renewable processes, such as green hydrogen production, carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into carbon-neutral chemicals and fuels, or other processes that can broadly decarbonize various industries. Traditional discovery methods are slow and serial, which limits the development of novel, commercially viable electrochemical processes demanded by the climate crisis. This project will enable a more rapid and exhaustive search for electrocatalysts, resulting in a deeper understanding of the nature of catalysts, and facilitating the decarbonization of the chemicals and energy industries by displacing traditional fossil fuel-based processes with a transition to electrification which utilizes increasing levels of renewable energy. The proposed platform will expedite the discovery and development of enabling materials, which can be brought to market and deployed globally to enable more renewable chemical processes.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a generalizable platform that can rapidly search through vast materials spaces for higher performance electrocatalyst materials, displacing the current materials which are simply the best amongst the limited candidates tested to date. Using this project?s proprietary Megalibrary technology, which enables the rapid synthesis of libraries of tens of thousands of unique, well-defined, monodisperse, and complex metal nanoparticles in a single experiment, coupled with high-throughput screening technologies, it is possible to quickly probe hundreds of thousands of unique catalyst candidates to find electrocatalysts optimized for performance. To accomplish this goal, the project must adapt protocols to allow the synthesis of electrocatalyst Megalibraries on electrodes and enable electrocatalyst screening. Additionally, the approach requires robust and high-throughput screening methods that can site-specifically interrogate the electrocatalytic properties of the catalyst candidates. Using these two innovations, it will be possible to then demonstrate the power of the platform by searching the entirety of a three element platinium and materials (Pt-M1-M2) space for the best hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst on a per platinum-atom basis. This demonstration will solidify the ability to translate this platform to a much broader materials space and set of reactions, which can impact businesses and industries globally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The thawing of organic carbon stored in Arctic permafrost soils ultimately creates carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas). Further, this process is predicted to amplify with additional global warming, however, to an unknown extent. Therefore, we need to quantify the extent to which carbon dioxide released from thawing permafrost will amplify global warming; this is one of the most urgent questions that Arctic scientists must answer. To address this, this project will make measurements to quantify how much carbon dioxide is produced when organic carbon from thawing permafrost soils flows into sunlit arctic surface waters. The project will also leverage an existing University of Michigan program called Earth Camp to engage high school students about environmental sciences through hands-on experiences and outdoor activities.<br/><br/>As water moves through thawed soil it dissolves organic carbon. This dissolved organic carbon (DOC) then flows into streams, ponds, and lakes. Once in surface waters, both microbes and sunlight oxidize DOC to CO2. DOC exposed to sunlight is easier for microbes to oxidize to CO2 compared to the same DOC kept in the dark. However, the sunlight reaching surface waters spans a spectrum of wavelengths, from the high-energy ultraviolet (UV) to the lower-energy visible light. A critical unknown is which wavelengths of sunlight from the UV to the visible are most efficient at helping microbes to oxidize DOC to CO2. If visible light helps microbes oxidize more DOC to CO2 than currently assumed, the CO2 produced from this process could be double the current estimate because there is more visible light reaching surface waters than UV light. In addition, different wavelengths of sunlight may help microbes oxidize a fraction of DOC that, in the absence of sunlight, microbes would not be able to oxidize to CO2. This fraction of DOC that is difficult to oxidize may be some of the oldest carbon that has been frozen for thousands of years in permafrost soils. This project will test how efficiently sunlight helps microbes oxidize ancient permafrost DOC by measuring the amount and radiocarbon age of the CO2 produced from microbial oxidation of permafrost DOC exposed to UV and visible sunlight. Results from this project will enable predictions of the CO2 produced from ancient permafrost organic carbon thawed and exported to sunlit surface waters, which is critical knowledge needed to quantify arctic amplification of global warming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People living in rural areas including Alaska, often cite water as a scarce resource and often visit a washateria/laundromat or haul water to wash their clothing. Many homes do not have the water hookups needed for a washing machine, and it often takes a day to do laundry by hand. Current laundry appliances rely on large-scale mechanical agitation for washing and heat-driven evaporation of retained water for drying. The average washing machine uses 20 gallons of water to operate and uses hot and cold water hook-ups for operation. The standard dryer requires a 240-volt dedicated circuit. Clothes dryers account for 6% of residential energy usage and are responsible for 40 million metric tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions. The proposed technology leverages ultrasound to reduce the energy and water consumption of home laundry appliances while combining the processes into one low-cost appliance. These factors not only reduce the cost of ownership but make the proposed appliance more accessible to smaller dwellings.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an accessible, all-in-one ultrasonic washer and dryer to save time, space, and resources in environments that lack the traditional infrastructure for washers and dryers. The core technology is an ultrasonic transducer array that enables washing and drying to be performed with less energy and water in a single, compact appliance. Ultrasound is used to drive the creation of bubbles. Upon collapse, they generate a localized force and heat which gently expels dirt out of clothing. In the drying process, the technology uses ultrasonic atomization to cut drying time and use less power, allowing for the use of a standard wall outlet.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the increase in demand for transparency in the wood industry and more stringent regulations comes a demand for new technologies that support compliance. Despite being a critical step in this process, current methods for species identification are time consuming, require highly specialized training, and provide little information on age and origin. By combining a highly sensitive type of spectroscopy with advanced statistical approaches (i.e., machine learning), this project is developing a method that can reliably identify chemical fingerprints that inform about wood species, age, and origin when compared against a database. This Phase I project will develop and demonstrate this approach when applied to U.S. woods, including the creation of a wood species database, with these key objectives: 1) analyze domestic woods to develop statistical methods to identify the species; 2) test the method?s ability identify species within composite materials; 3) test the method?s ability to identify the geographical origin of samples; and 4) test the method?s ability to determine wood age.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the market for these types of ecological assets has not yet been tested, the demand for carbon credits and other ecosystem services is growing rapidly. Current carbon credit origination costs are too expensive for small projects, only making financial sense beyond 1200 hectares in most cases. This technology will unlock the ability for the roughly 5 million small-holder farmers (farmers with only a few hectares of land) around the world to participate in these markets, scaling supply to meet the current demand and making meaningful progress toward climate goals.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of practice-based methodologies for verifying changes in ecological state using human-sensing (images and data recorded via smartphones), sky-sensing (satellite and drone images), remote-sensing (internet of things devices and sensors) and reputational-sensing (community accreditation of trustworthy projects). This project is developing a sustainable and scalable model for issuing practice-based ecological assets using decentralized, digital forms of measurement, reporting, and verification of ecosystem services. The technology is a platform to collect, synthesize, and share verifiable carbon sequestration data from international small-scale farmers. This approach reduces costs and increases climate action by leveraging often-overlooked small-holder farmers and technology readily available to them (more affordable, on their mobile phones, and via satellite imaging), to prove their conversion to regenerative practices.

This project will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of an algorithmic approach and robotic development. The technology is a step towards creating a fully autonomous system with expanded robotics capability to further enhance the efficiency and speed of outbound shipping for customers. Over 3,000 parcels are shipped every second. However, in the U.S., one out of every four trucks is empty, two are less than 50% filled, and only one is filled over 50% capacity.  Initial projections indicate that the technology under development could decrease trucking costs by 20%, reduce loading costs by 70-80%, and decrease loading time by 30%, all while meeting the demands of peak shipping seasons. Overall, increasing the density of parcel shipping will reduce greenhouse gas emissions (400 tons/per truck/per year), reduce traffic congestion, and enable smaller businesses to compete with large organizations by reducing their logistics and shipping operating costs.<br/><br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on advancing a bin packing algorithm to minimize void space in outbound shipping containers. The 3-Dimentional Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) is a classic Nonlinear Programming (NP)-hard problem that has been studied for decades. To solve the problem, an effective and easy-to-implement constrained, quantum accelerated, deep reinforcement learning model is being developed. Monte Carlo Tree Search is an unsupervised, heuristic search algorithm technique in which the learning agent learns to predict the expected value of a variable occurring at the end of a sequence of states. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) extends this technique by allowing the learned state-values to guide actions which subsequently change the environment state. A proof-of-concept assessment showed that the learned strategy meaningfully outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Outcome success metrics for this project are >90% utilization rate, sub 24 hours of model training time, and >2500 parcels/hour for any given data set.

A portion of this charred material is dissolved upon interaction with water and is carried away from soils to rivers as dissolved black carbon (DBC). A warmer and drier climate has led to increased wildfire activity in Arctic regions and it is unknown how these changes will affect the amount of DBC in rivers and its fate in the coastal environment. In the summer of 2022, the Apoon Pass and East Fork Fires burned >255,000 acres in the Yukon River Delta (Alaska, USA), part of a trend towards larger and more frequent wildfires in the Delta in recent years. The main goal of this project is to determine whether recent wildfire activity in the Delta leads to increased amounts of DBC along the Yukon River and estuary to the coastal Arctic Ocean. Results of this work will lay the groundwork for future, large-scale studies on fire-derived carbon in vulnerable Arctic watersheds. This project will support collaboration among two early career researchers and one graduate student with guidance from an experienced Arctic investigator.<br/><br/>Pan-Arctic watersheds are experiencing increased fire activity as a result of climate change. The cumulative effects of wildfire (charcoal production, soil destabilization, change in hydrologic flow paths) on carbon export in major Arctic rivers is currently unknown. This project will determine whether large, recent wildfires within the Yukon River Delta have changed the distribution, composition, and total export of DBC along the Yukon River-to-Arctic Ocean continuum. To achieve this goal, new samples will be collected during the 2023 spring freshet and results compared to those obtained from archived 2019 freshet samples. We will employ a combination of molecular marker, stable carbon isotope, and ultrahigh resolution mass spectral techniques to evaluate wildfire-DBC relationships in the Yukon River Delta between low-fire (2019; ~10,000 acres burned) and high-fire (2023; >255,000 acres burned) years. This work builds upon other efforts to predict the effects of climate change on carbon cycling in Arctic-boreal landscapes and will assist in answering broad research questions regarding the behavior of DBC in intermediate reservoirs and fate of terrestrial organic matter in the coastal ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, in American English, the word WALKING can be pronounced as either walking or the more casual walkin'. Among the many social and linguistic factors shaping which option people choose, it is known that people tend to repeat the same pronunciation that they have recently used or heard. For example, an English speaker who just said or heard workin' becomes more likely to say playin' a few moments later, repeating the use of the casual -in' pronunciation even on a different word. In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigators use laboratory speech perception and production experiments to ask how basic properties of human cognition lead to this kind of repetitiveness in real-world language use. The results of the project have the long-term potential to help improve the capacity of language technology to handle the socially-meaningful variability that is pervasive in everyday language, to identify typical and atypical language use patterns in clinical settings, and generally to contribute to our scientific and cultural understanding of how humans communicate across a diverse range of language backgrounds.<br/><br/>The repetitiveness effect described above, known as variant persistence, has often been attributed to a cognitive process called priming, where processing a particular linguistic form makes it easier to produce the same form again. This dissertation provides experimental evidence for priming variable pronunciations in perception and production through English words whose ending alternates between -ing and -in', connecting data from controlled laboratory experiments with data from informal conversational speech in order to understand the perception and production of socially-situated language variation. A series of laboratory experiments will be conducted to show that variable pronunciations can be primed in perception and to investigate how these priming effects may be weakened or strengthened under various circumstances. To tie more closely into previous work on variant persistence in large corpora of conversational speech data, the proposed experiments also examine priming of the variable pronunciations that individuals choose in speech production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since ancient times, people have been interested in integer solutions to equations, called Diophantine equations; the Pythagorean equation, the Pell equation, and Fermat's Last Theorem are well-known problems of this type. In modern times, research has focused on general techniques for this sort of problem. A breakthrough result, proven by Faltings, shows that certain types of equations have only finitely many integer solutions. However, there is no known algorithm to find these solutions in general; algorithmic approaches to Diophantine equations are an active area of research. Surprisingly, this problem relates to many other areas in math, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, Galois theory, and more. In order to compute solutions to Diophantine problems, we need to develop methods to perform some calculations in these other fields.  This project involves studying several of these difficult computational problems.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate various computational and algorithmic topics related to finiteness theorems in number theory. For example, a theorem of Faltings guarantees a polynomial equation of a certain type can have only finitely many rational solutions. (In geometric language, a curve of genus at least two can have only finitely many rational points.) All known proofs of Faltings's theorem are ineffective: one knows that the solutions are finite in number, but the proof provides no way to tell whether one has found them all. Recent work, including a new proof of Faltings's theorem by the PI and Venkatesh, has opened up promising new avenues toward an algorithmic solution. The PI will study algorithmic and computational questions in algebraic geometry and number theory, motivated by Faltings's theorem and other problems in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. The PI hopes to study algorithmic approaches to the Shafarevich conjecture (determining abelian varieties over a fixed number field, with good reduction away from a fixed finite set of bad primes) and the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence (finding algebraic differential equations with given monodromy representations).  The Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, in turn, should be applicable to the problem of finding branched covers of curves, as well as the problem of studying variations of Hodge structure over a given base. Both these problems relate to Faltings's theorem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, cells in nature rarely live alone, but instead reside in communities such as tissues or microbial communities known as biofilms. A compelling biological problem is the determination of what rules of life govern the transition from a collection of individual cells to a multicellular community. Biofilms are used as a model to address this problem since they are structured communities composed of millions of single-celled bacteria that exhibit emergent coordination and dynamic cell-to-cell signaling reminiscent of multicellular organisms. The overarching goal is to understand the emergent coordinated group behaviors in bacterial biofilm communities that arise from cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms, and how these emergent behaviors impart functional community-level benefits. The project uses synthetic microbial communities to systematically construct mixed biofilms that can be quantified with single-cell resolution using microfluidics. Aided by a mathematical model, acetylcholine signaling dynamics is mapped to changes in membrane voltage for a set of mixed biofilm populations. Understanding how bacterial communities are coordinated to respond to their environments could provide an untapped source of new biology that could be harnessed for both basic science and biomedical applications. This new understanding could be applied to a range of circumstances from overcoming biofilm antibiotic resistance to developing in vivo microbial diagnostics using synthetic biology. This multidisciplinary research project also provides fertile ground for quantitative training opportunities for students in systems and synthetic biology and attracts students into pursuing new areas of scientific inquiry using the latest research on microbial communities.<br/><br/>While microbiologists have long studied gene regulation and metabolism in solitary bacterial cultures and have begun to describe biofilm-level morphology and pattern formation, integrating these two scales has been challenging. Here, using recently developed fluorescent protein biosensors, the PI has uncovered coordinated spatiotemporal oscillations in novel metabolites that spontaneously emerge during biofilm development. Since many of these metabolites lack known functional roles in bacteria, this discovery provides a model phenomenon to interrogate how previously unexplored cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms give rise to coordinated group behavior in biofilms. Specifically, the PI is using synthetic microbial communities to systematically construct mixed biofilms that are quantified with single-cell resolution using microfluidics. Aided by a mathematical model, spatiotemporal metabolic dynamics are mapped to changes in membrane voltage for each mixed biofilm population. These measurements are used to decipher the mechanistic basis for how these metabolites interface with electrochemical signaling to increase biofilm fitness. By combining quantitative measurement techniques and a tractable model system for multicellular dynamics, this research is poised to uncover new rules of multicellular life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the global population grows to 10 billion by 2050, the agriculture industry will need to produce 70% more food using only 5% more land. Indoor farming can make a significant contribution to meet this demand sustainably. Indoor farmers are also seasonally and geographically independent, which means they can help meet demands for locally produced fresh foods and are protected from extreme weather events. These farms primarily use soilless growing methods, such as hydroponics, that currently suffer from critical needs for efficient and affordable methods to monitor and manage nutrients and water in order to be financially viable and environmentally sustainable. The proposed project provides an innovative solution for nutrient management in hydroponic farming, thereby lowering the costs, increasing the yield potential, and supporting the viability of such farms. By supporting the expansion of the national hydroponics industry, this project will increase the local production of and expand access to fresh produce.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a nutrient management system to provide CEA farmers with real-time information about the nutrients in the growth solution of their crops.  The proposed solution will utilize ion-selective electrode (ISE) technology and a decision support system powered by machine learning (ML). This project will focus on the critically needed engineering and data analytics research and development to de-risk major technical challenges in the development of the nutrient management system, providing proof-of-feasibility. The key objectives of this project are to: 1) design a special chamber for the sensors to minimize the interference and increase accuracy, 2) validate the feasibility and accuracy of this new design in a greenhouse setting, 3) develop a predictive algorithm to automatically calibrate the sensors, and 4) measure and predict deficiencies in leafy greens production: collecting empirical evidence of nutrient deficiency to train ML models to identify, and ultimately, predict a deficiency prior to when it is observable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To be effective and impactful, assistive mechanisms need to capture and respond to the subtle and changing context of the human. Human behaviors, however, are challenging to learn due to their complexity and the constantly changing physical, social, and environmental context. Recently, wearables have emerged to fill this gap as users are adopting a variety of devices to help them monitor health related parameters. Given their ubiquity, wearables are positioned ideally to deliver persuasive content aimed at improving users? health outcomes.  However, there is a need for a holistic approach to infer human health behaviors, even as the user's context and the devices measuring their behavior vary over time. The proposed research has the potential to transform human health outcomes by capturing and responding to fine-grained behavioral information continuously, inexpensively, and unobtrusively. This human-in-the-loop system will facilitate rapid development of Health applications by providing the foundations for using adaptive and personalized interventions for diverse health populations to enable assistive care for all.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to develop human-in-the-loop cyber-physical systems that can model human behaviors and enable assistive interventions in sparse multi-device environments. This research will engender: (i) modeling human motion in sparse multi-device environments; (ii) learning motion-derived behavioral measures (verbal, physical, and psychological); (iii) a human-in-the-loop model that delivers interventions to the human and solicits their feedback when needed; and (iv) development and evaluation of the proposed techniques with target health populations. Our key idea is to develop novel techniques for learning coarse and fine-grained human motion in sparse multi-device environments, and infer physical, verbal, and psychological behaviors from human motion. This ultimately feeds into a human-in-the-loop CPS model to deliver the right interventions at the right time for target behavioral outcomes.

Temporal phenomena exhibit structure at various time scales?long events (e.g., breakfast) are composed of multiple long-term activities (e.g., cooking an omelet), which in turn are composed of various atomic actions (e.g., cutting onions). This project will develop computational representations of temporal phenomena that capture how concepts evolve over time by accentuating temporal cues in videos. Leveraging these representations, this work will create software that can discover distinctive recurring atomic actions from video collections and learn to compose these atomic actions to understand and explain long-term, complex temporal phenomena. The outcomes of this project will enable computers to be significantly better at recognizing complex activities, detecting anomalies, and forecasting future actions. The developed technologies have the potential to address challenges in several areas, such as analyzing weather patterns and forecasting extreme events, provenance search for malicious content on the internet, and indexing and searching internet-scale video collections using natural activity-level queries. Integrated with the research is a comprehensive plan for education, mentoring, and outreach, including training students in research at multiple levels, contributing to curriculum development for undergraduate and graduate courses, and designing outreach programs to attract diverse students at multiple levels.<br/><br/>At a technical level, this project will address fundamental challenges in understanding long-term temporal phenomena. At the core of this project is the notion of ?motifs??distinctive repeating temporal patterns?that can be assembled into long-term narratives, such as activities. The research program seeks advances in three key areas: (a) unsupervised temporal representation learning, where this work will develop disentangled temporal representations that can better model temporal phenomena, (b) discovering motifs, which will develop a large scale framework for discovering distinctive repeating temporal patterns as atomic actions, from unlabeled videos, which can help understand long-term activities, and (c) learning to assemble motifs to decompose actions. The project presents scalable strategies to learn implicit and explicit stochastic grammars of actions from unlabeled videos, revisiting a long-standing problem using contemporary data-driven methods.

Darwinian fitness, or individual survival and reproduction, is a foundational concept in biology. Scientists have hypothesized that the rate at which a population adapts is predicted by the genetic inheritance of individual fitness. Such a hypothesis could enable the forecasting of evolution and population dynamics, allowing scientists the ability to predict how natural populations respond to future environmental changes and if populations will persist or go extinct. The goals of this project are to establish a research program to (1) improve evolutionary predictions and (2) integrate education programs that train students and teachers to conduct hypothesis-driven research. The education component will teach high school teachers and students about evolution by natural selection while training them to conduct their own scientific research through independent projects that will further the project?s overall research goals. These plans involve students at the high school and undergraduate levels and seek to train high school teachers from throughout Alabama. Through involvement of several thousand students from across Alabama, this project?s activities address basic science literacy, engagement in STEM, and development of STEM educators and educational resources.<br/><br/>Fisher?s fundamental theorem of natural selection expresses the rate of population mean fitness change due to natural selection as a function of the additive genetic variance for fitness. The fundamental theorem of evolution is a broader statement about fitness change that includes the response due to natural selection and additional forces acting on population mean fitness. Despite a long history of theoretical development, there has been little empirical testing of either the fundamental theorems of evolution or natural selection. This project is a first-of-its-kind study to experimentally manipulate additive genetic variance for fitness among replicate populations of seed beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus) to test the theory that this genetic variance is the key quantity predicting the rate of change in population mean fitness. The project will then connect estimates of genetic variance in fitness with genetic covariance quantifying environmental deterioration for fitness arising from conspecific interactions. The impacts of conspecific competition and sexual conflict on fitness evolution address a long-standing, but unresolved debate whether sexual selection provides net costs or benefits to populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The outcome of this research contributes better zoning information, as well as data collection, processing, and mapping tools, to illuminate zoning, one of the most important, yet understudied, governmental powers impacting our economy and society. First, the project assembles hundreds of zoning codes, manually reviews them, and incorporates specific regulatory information into the publicly-accessible National Zoning Atlas. Then, the research team develops natural language processing methods to transform these zoning codes to structured data and ensure data accuracy by comparing the outputs of the automated process to the manual results. The compiled data and developed tools can facilitate concrete, actionable insights and unlock secondary research about zoning?s impact on housing availability, transportation systems, the environment, economic opportunity, educational opportunity, and our food supply. <br/><br/>Specifically, the research examines whether contemporary natural language processing techniques can successfully decipher complex local zoning codes. The team collects information about zoning codes and uses this information to train an algorithm for extracting key elements of zoning codes and regulations. The output data consist of zoning variables, such as zoning district names and specific rules for each district, ready for analysis and mapping. The team assesses the algorithm?s performance for accuracy and precision against human-performed reviews of zoning codes. If successful, the resulting data tool can offer local policymakers, researchers, and advocates across the U.S. the opportunity to compare zoning codes and processes in their state or nationwide with decreased manual effort, and to produce quality data for improved decision making, participatory planning, and regional collaboration. Moreover, the approach can guide future researchers interested in creating natural language processing models for other types of administrative law texts, including highway safety manuals, building codes, city plans, and more.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, the project proposes to increase students? perception of, interest in, and motivation to pursue research careers. Research studies have shown that students, particularly women, students from historically underserved groups, and first-generation students, often value communal goals of working together and helping people.  Consequently, the project proposes to create innovative undergraduate courses in which students not only perform STEM research but also apply their research work to directly serve their communities. This combination of research and service learning has the potential to transform students? ideas about research, including the capacity of research to help people.  In addition, it can also empower the communities with whom the students work.<br/><br/>We propose to combine two high-impact practices, service learning and research experiences, to create a Service-Learning theme within a Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (SL-CURE).  This SL-CURE will be implemented in three different institutions: (1) a large, public, historically black university; (2) a small, private, predominantly white liberal arts college; and (3) a large, public Hispanic serving institution in the context of multiple disciplines (biology, public health, social work). Assessing the impact of the SL-CURE will be grounded in the theory of the transtheoretical stages of change from pre-contemplation (when students don?t consider research as a potential career) through preparation (when students develop scientific skills and a broader, more realistic perspective of research affordance of communal goals). The project will also contribute to the STEM education community by assessing how specific implementations of service-learning, including community-based participatory research, science communication and outreach, and mentoring, influence students? perceptions of, interest in, and engagement in research practices not only during the course, but also one to two years beyond course completion. Disseminating this model is expected to influence existing and future CURES, which may result in a strong positive impact on retaining diverse individuals in the STEM workforce pipeline. This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources.   The IUSE: EHR program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

These households?often out of reach of government support?must take steps themselves to address the dramatic shifts already occurring in their local environments. Appropriate reaction therefore relies not only on access to the right tools to respond to the harmful effects of global warming but also on the knowledge to implement these measures in the first place. Yet several characteristic features of climate change, such as the small, incremental steps through which the environment evolves, make learning in this domain particularly challenging. This research project will explore these frictions to belief formation using new survey data among farmers in rural areas and test the extent to which they inhibit people's capacity to adjust to the environmental changes around them. Using an experiment correcting farmers? beliefs about the harmful consequences of global warming on their own plots, this project will evaluate the scope for a low-cost policy to improve technological adaptation. The results of this project will contribute to our understanding of how individuals adapt to climate change, and the new datasets measuring both beliefs and the incidence of environmental shocks will be made freely available to other researchers.<br/><br/>This project will delve into farmers? underlying mental models to understand how these households update about decision-relevant features of their local environment that have been impacted by global warming. Increased soil salinity threatens to dramatically reduce crop production without shifts in irrigation techniques and seed choice. Like with many dimensions of climate change, learning about rising soil salinity presents significant challenges: the underlying causal process is opaque (impacted by rising sea levels, depleting groundwater reserves, and increasing flooding) and changes often happen incrementally embedded in seasonal patterns. Economic theories of limited attention suggest that small shifts will remain neglected, generating mistaken underestimation of true salt levels. This project will elicit quantitative beliefs among farmers about salinity on their plots to provide direct measurement of expectations about their local environment. Using natural experiments in salt levels due to the interaction of flooding and water salinity calculated using recent advances in remote sensing, this project will test mental models of belief formation by assessing which signals trigger updating by farmers. By randomly providing information based on direct soil salinity measurements from farmers? own plots, this project will measure the elasticity of technological adoption with respect to beliefs, providing an evaluation of a low-cost policy to improve adaptation to climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By identifying barriers and bridges for women STEM faculty, this project aims to produce institutional change that will impact not only STEM, but also all women faculty at TCU. More broadly, as any institution develops an environment of equity as the norm, graduates of master and doctoral programs will enter their academic careers with a mindset of equity which has the potential to increase the number of women STEM faculty. In addition, systemic change (with an increase in the number of women faculty) has the potential to enhance infrastructure for research and education on our campus. The analysis and resulting five-year strategic plan may ground the work of other private universities with similar demographics and historical contexts.<br/><br/>The Texas Christian University ADVANCE Catalyst project is grounded in the robust literature of three academic areas; challenges for women in higher education (especially STEM), intersectionality, and self-studies in higher education. Combining these bodies of work, the focus is on understanding the institution?s role in cultivating challenges and disparate work contexts for intersectional women faculty. This project will consider the other identities and positions held by women/females to understand their positionality. The short-term goal is to conduct a self-study to identify systemic factors that impede equity and inclusion of women in STEM, paying particular attention to the ways intersectional analyses will inform understandings of women?s experiences on campus given that those differences make a material difference in their lives as derived from their diverse identities. A key strength of the project is the qualitative focus on understanding the barriers/bridges when women STEM faculty are seen as a complex being who are more than their gender. Research questions include: (1) What are the barriers and bridges for recruiting, hiring, promoting, and retaining women/female faculty in STEM? (2) What are the most significant intersections for women faculty for recruiting, hiring, promoting, and retaining within STEM? The long-term goal is to implement the five-year strategic plan and document the efficacy of institutional change efforts.<br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.

These potential risks include hearing impairment, stress, loss of attention, hypertension, enhanced blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, several studies have also found a loss of productivity for employees due to exposure to construction equipment noise. The prevalence of hearing protection device (HPD) use among U.S. construction workers is very poor. Some of users' most common complaints are that hearing protectors are uncomfortable, hot, and create difficulties in hearing and understanding speech communication and warning signals. Standard earphones do not adequately filter out ambient environmental noise. Users wearing standard earphones must raise the volume of the sound to overcome the environmental noise, which may cause further damage to their hearing.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of hearing protection for construction workers that is designed to work with an interactive software application to give the user control of surrounding noise. This device recognizes all the sounds in the environment from a predefined library and labels them based on their type. This assignment may allow the user to filter out the background noises based on their needs using the application. The application is designed to produce a signal with a 180-shift delay to cancel the noises that the user selected to block. The interaction of these two noises is found to be destructive, causing the sound to be phased out. Using the application, people exposed to the job site noise may customize and choose which ambient sounds they want to hear and which ones they do not want to hear based on their needs. Therefore, they may opt out of the sound of a jackhammer while still being able to hear any warning signals.  This sound selectivity may provide greater safety and hearing protection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Heterostructures formed by stacking distinct two-dimensional materials demonstrate exceptional mechanical and electronic properties, such as superlubricity, high strain tolerance, and correlated electronic physics. These properties originate from the van der Waals interactions at the heterointerfaces formed by the two-dimensional materials. A fundamental feature that dictates the structural response of a heterointerface is the degree of incommensurability or incompatibility between the atomic lattices that form it. However, the problem of quantifying incommensurability and its effect on the structural response remains a fundamental open question, which will be explored in this project. The success of this study will lead to a theoretical and computational framework to strain engineer two-dimensional materials systems for applications such as next generation nanolubricants and electronic and optoelectronic devices. On the education and outreach front, the project will develop transdisciplinary STEAM activities wherein Art and Science complement each other. These activities will involve working directly with undergraduate and high school students and collaborating with high school teachers to develop learning modules centered around the science and art behind overlapping two-dimensional atomic lattices. <br/><br/>The dominant influence of bicrystallography on the design, synthesis, and transfer of two-dimensional materials systems and the ability to control the local microstructure using strain applied at the macroscale motivate this project's goal: to realize the full potential of strain engineering as a route to modulate the atomic reconstruction in heterointerfaces for functional performance gains. The objective is to completely characterize the response of heterointerfaces to temperature and shear and normal forces in terms of the interface's microstructure. This study will develop a unified framework wherein bicrystallography takes center stage to explore how a structural response to incommensurability manifests in interfacial dislocation behavior. Bicrystallography will be examined using algebraic tools like the Smith normal form to reveal the translational symmetry of the heterointerfaces and characterize their interface dislocations. Strain and substrate engineering will be realized by the modeling of interface dislocations and substrate lattice steps at the continuum and mesoscale. The outcome will lead to a new understanding of how structural properties emerge from van der Waals interactions and pave the way for a systematic design and large-scale synthesis of heterostructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technological transition, which occurred around 50,000 years ago, is one of the most prominent behavioral changes observed in human evolutionary history. Possible environmental drivers of the MSA-LSA transition have been proposed, but establishing robust links between environmental and behavioral change has been challenging due to the lack of appropriate datasets. This project will quantify the degree of precipitation seasonality, dietary seasonality, and large animal movement through this key period while fostering research links and providing a foundation for undergraduate training in a collaborative environment. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the project would enhance public understanding of science and the scientific method broadly disseminating its findings.<br/><br/>The proposed project advances our understanding of the MSA-LSA transition by addressing the question: Did seasonal changes in resource availability influence human behavior across the MSA-LSA transition? Three objectives will be used to address this question through stable isotope analysis of serially-sampled fossil herbivore teeth from Pleistocene fossil sites: (i) using strontium isotopes to reconstruct Pleistocene migratory systems; (ii) using carbon and oxygen isotopes to evaluate how migration relates to precipitation and dietary seasonality; and (iii) assessing how seasonality and migration have shaped human foraging strategies and technological change during the last glacial period. Understanding the ecology of animals during glacial periods through these methods is essential to grasping the full picture of the evolutionary ecology of both living and extinct species, with implications for human evolution, biology, and conservation. Furthermore, this study will be the largest ever to evaluate serially-sampled strontium isotopes in this research context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed technology may help save time and effort for transportation agencies, and also promote transportation safety equity, especially for local agencies and underrepresented communities that have limited resources to improve their roadway safety.

This project investigates the regulation of these processes in two different viruses.  Understanding of this regulation process in greater detail will allow researchers to use it to exert control over viruses, both to inhibit viral infection and to re-purpose viral structures for biotechnology.  To ensure that viruses have the tools necessary for these processes while still maintaining a small genome, some viruses encode protein domains that have multiple functions. Intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) domains, for example, change shape to perform different functions. This project investigates a key mechanism enabling IDP domains to switch between functional shapes, which is modification of the protein with phosphate, a process called phosphorylation. The project will also engage and motivate the public to learn more about viruses and how computers are used to study them through different types of outreach activities. Researchers will develop software to enable students to learn computational biophysical chemistry, update undergraduate courses with hands-on computational biophysics modules to improve interdisciplinary training of biochemists, and leverage crochet to engage students, adults, and non-scientists alike in learning about virus structure and research.<br/><br/>Phosphorylation has been implicated as a key regulator of capsid function in viruses, but the molecular determinants of this phenomena have not been elucidated. For example, hepatitis B virus (HBV, a human virus that infects liver tissue) and Brome mosaic virus (BMV, a plant virus that infects cereal crops) capsids both contain multi-functional IDPs that undergo differential, reversible phosphorylation. It is hypothesized that variable phosphorylation patterns control the conformational ensembles of the IDPs. However, owing to intrinsic disorder, atomistic structures of the IDPs have not been resolved, impeding characterization of structure-function relationships. This project will use atomistic modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to establish the role of phosphorylation patterns in regulating specific RNA recognition for genome packaging, the mechanism and timing of intracellular trafficking signal display, and interactions required for the infiltration of host organelles, namely the nucleus for HBV and the endoplasmic reticulum for BMV. By cataloging the effects of phosphates on viral IDPs in terms of conformation, dynamics, and binding interactions, we can begin to establish the rules of phospho-regulation as utilized by viruses for genome encapsidation and host cell manipulation. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed technology significantly reduces the workload of measuring house-level lowest floor elevation and largely facilitates community-level flood damage assessment by providing services of on-the-fly damage predictions with user-defined scenarios. One benefit of the successful deployment of the proposed technology may be to help communities quickly explore the spatial distribution of flood risks and test how flood events with varying intensities affect individual houses as well as the whole community.

From September 27, 2022, just before Hurricane Ian made landfall, and continually for the next nine days, teams from Florida State University and Texas A&M University helped coordinate 24 UAS pilots flying 16 different models of fixed-wing and rotorcraft UAS over Charlotte, Lee, and Hardee counties. These missions obtained aerial imagery to survey wind and flood damage, direct ground response, support strategic planning and resource allocation, monitor threats to public safety, and provide documentation for subsequent emergency relief funding. Under this award, the research team will curate 55,000 images and videos collected during the disaster, comprising over 750 gigabytes of data, and supporting material such as flight schedules and log files. The curated data, and derived products such as aerial maps and edited video, will be made publicly available for open-source use. The project will analyze the mission logs and data products to assess pilot performance over time, and will document variables potentially influencing pilot performance, including pilot skill, prior training and experience, operations tempo, and fatiguing conditions, supplemented by individual and collective interviews with the UAS pilots. The image dataset and derived products will help the computer vision/machine learning (CV/ML) community design better algorithms for identifying threats to public safety, damaged structures, and people in distress.  The pilot performance dataset will be made available to the research community, to characterize human-robot performance, formulate best practices, and to understand deviation in behaviors and sources of mission error. The resulting insights into proper matching of vehicles, pilots, missions, and operational parameters will increase the ability of UAS platforms and pilots to save lives and accelerate economic recovery after a disaster. The datasets can help the domestic UAS industry improve products for response to a broad class of natural disasters, including wildfires and flooding, and for use in extreme environments, such as in oil and gas exploration and extraction and for in nuclear reactors and nuclear waste sites. The project will support the creation of better workflow procedures to reduce human error, increasing trust in the technology by UAS operators and other first responders, and facilitating adoption of UAS for emergency response. The project will broaden participation in science, with three women out of the four co-PIs, and will engage STEM students to help annotate the UAS imagery. <br/><br/>This project will curate vehicle and pilot data from the deployment of uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) during Hurricane Ian by Florida State University and Texas A&M University for the robotics, computer vision/machine learning (CV/ML), human-robot interaction, and geospatial land-use communities. The project has the following three objectives: 1) Curate the data (imagery, log files, flight schedules, etc.) and data products (images, video, orthomosaic maps, digital surface maps) collected during the disaster and make available for open-source use; 2) Interview the UAS pilots individually and collectively in order to capture human-robot performance, best practices, deviation in behaviors, and sources of error; and 3) Analyze the mission logs and data products for performance (quality or completeness) and document the quality over time by pilots, prior training, and frequency of flying the missions in normative conditions, the operations tempo, and fatiguing conditions. From a robotics perspective, it will contribute to the emerging model of how multiple agents may be used during disasters, and the consequences for design, performance specifications, the role of artificial intelligence, and wireless communications. Such a model can greatly increase the competitiveness of the domestic drone industry, as well as motivate novel directions in swarm research. Research stemming from this project will generate guidelines for data collection in future disasters, setting the stage for advances in engineering and computing for disasters. It will increase the availability of training data for CV/ML and serve as a testbed for transfer of learned features from other disasters; both of which could lead to fundamental advances in machine learning. From a human-factors perspective, it will generate a new methodology for creating human-robot datasets that combine on-site direct data (with no experimenters in the field) with post-event data. This methodology would overcome current barriers in conducting empirical investigations into scientific questions on extreme work environments because of the prohibition on embedded experimenters. This methodology is expected to transfer to other extreme work environments, such as nuclear, space, oil and gas industry, and the military. The human-robot data itself could lead to major findings in human error and workforce training. From a geospatial perspective, the data can help establish the impact of rising sea levels, the built environment, and prior storm surge and flooding mitigations. Overall, the project will benefit society by increasing the ability to save lives and accelerate economic recovery after a disaster with UAS and is expected to create findings and methods that will generalize to new technologies for extreme environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experimental studies on the impact of vertical accelerations on building response rarely have been conducted. Thus, numerical models cannot account for realistic data to predict the performance of building components. In this study, a near full-scale ten-story steel building will be instrumented to measure its vertical accelerations when tested on a shake table. The experimental data will be used to create numerical models to understand the behavior of beams, columns, slabs, and other components under vertical and horizontal seismic ground motions. The numerical models will be modified according to American design specifications to predict the seismic performance of steel buildings designed according to these standards and guidelines. Therefore, this research will improve the performance of steel buildings in seismic regions of the United States and provide much needed data for investigations on the vibration effects of beams and slabs on building occupants. The project will also support two Ph.D. students in the earthquake engineering field. The research outcomes will be disseminated through reports and journal publications.

The steel building includes moment resisting frames in the transverse direction and a dual system in the longitudinal direction consisting of interior buckling-restrained braced frames and exterior moment resisting frames. Non-structural components will be installed on several floors, as well as curtain walls. The structure will be subjected to ground motions with monotonically increasing seismic intensity, and structural components are expected to exhibit nonlinear inelastic behavior in the final stages of the experiment. The study tasks consist of i) implementing an instrumentation network in the ten-story steel building to collect accelerations and deformations on structural components during three-dimensional seismic shaking, ii) creating subassembly and system finite element models using research and commercial software platforms, resulting in validated modeling techniques to capture the impact of three-dimensional excitations, and iii) assessing the implications of vertical seismic demands on the structural resiliency of steel buildings designed according to U.S. practice. The study will produce the most complete and realistic modeling knowledge to date on the effect of vertical accelerations on steel buildings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to improve upon existing global financial infrastructure by replacing it with a safe, open, accessible network powered by the proposed next-generation distributed ledger architecture. Accessing traditional financial networks is a major challenge, and often requires significant capital coupled with deep industry connections. As DLT stands today, there are still challenges for it to safely support financial applications. DLT vulnerabilities can cost users billions of dollars and is leading to the same monopolistic dynamics that are characteristic of traditional financial infrastructure. This project aims to advance the foundation of distributed ledger technology to address these issues, and deliver an accessible, safe, democratized financial infrastructure that can operate on a global scale and support the untold myriad of value-added use cases from companies that cannot sustain the high economic costs, or overcome the accessibility barriers, of traditional financial infrastructure.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project seeks to advance distributed ledger technology to safely support financial primitives. Transaction information in modern distributed ledgers is public during origination, allowing validators to exploit this information and at times their privileged position to attack every financial primitive. As an example, there are issues with validators taking arbitrage opportunities and sequencing their own transactions first. Financial best practices are to silo transactions into distinct lifecycle stages to ensure consumer safety. This solution brings these best practices to DLT through a cryptographic commitment scheme. Cryptographic commitment schemes allow users to commit to an action without disclosing sensitive details, however, the traditional process requires centralization to coordinate the timing for disclosure. The primary research goal and objective for this Phase I project is proving the viability of a decentralized commitment scheme with real world latency and no centralized timekeeping or coordination mechanism. The proposed architecture will allow users to initiate transactions without including sensitive transaction details at origination. Without sensitive transaction details, validators can no longer exploit this information for their own gain, allowing this architecture to provide the security and privacy necessary for improved safety for financial applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From September 27, 2022, just before Hurricane Ian made landfall, and continually for the next nine days, teams from Florida State University and Texas A&M University helped coordinate 24 UAS pilots flying 16 different models of fixed-wing and rotorcraft UAS over Charlotte, Lee, and Hardee counties. These missions obtained aerial imagery to survey wind and flood damage, direct ground response, support strategic planning and resource allocation, monitor threats to public safety, and provide documentation for subsequent emergency relief funding. Under this award, the research team will curate 55,000 images and videos collected during the disaster, comprising over 750 gigabytes of data, and supporting material such as flight schedules and log files. The curated data, and derived products such as aerial maps and edited video, will be made publicly available for open-source use. The project will analyze the mission logs and data products to assess pilot performance over time, and will document variables potentially influencing pilot performance, including pilot skill, prior training and experience, operations tempo, and fatiguing conditions, supplemented by individual and collective interviews with the UAS pilots. The image dataset and derived products will help the computer vision/machine learning (CV/ML) community design better algorithms for identifying threats to public safety, damaged structures, and people in distress.  The pilot performance dataset will be made available to the research community, to characterize human-robot performance, formulate best practices, and to understand deviation in behaviors and sources of mission error. The resulting insights into proper matching of vehicles, pilots, missions, and operational parameters will increase the ability of UAS platforms and pilots to save lives and accelerate economic recovery after a disaster. The datasets can help the domestic UAS industry improve products for response to a broad class of natural disasters, including wildfires and flooding, and for use in extreme environments, such as in oil and gas exploration and extraction and for in nuclear reactors and nuclear waste sites. The project will support the creation of better workflow procedures to reduce human error, increasing trust in the technology by UAS operators and other first responders, and facilitating adoption of UAS for emergency response. The project will broaden participation in science, with three women out of the four co-PIs, and will engage STEM students to help annotate the UAS imagery. <br/><br/>This project will curate vehicle and pilot data from the deployment of uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) during Hurricane Ian by Florida State University and Texas A&M University for the robotics, computer vision/machine learning (CV/ML), human-robot interaction, and geospatial land-use communities. The project has the following three objectives: 1) Curate the data (imagery, log files, flight schedules, etc.) and data products (images, video, orthomosaic maps, digital surface maps) collected during the disaster and make available for open-source use; 2) Interview the UAS pilots individually and collectively in order to capture human-robot performance, best practices, deviation in behaviors, and sources of error; and 3) Analyze the mission logs and data products for performance (quality or completeness) and document the quality over time by pilots, prior training, and frequency of flying the missions in normative conditions, the operations tempo, and fatiguing conditions. From a robotics perspective, it will contribute to the emerging model of how multiple agents may be used during disasters, and the consequences for design, performance specifications, the role of artificial intelligence, and wireless communications. Such a model can greatly increase the competitiveness of the domestic drone industry, as well as motivate novel directions in swarm research. Research stemming from this project will generate guidelines for data collection in future disasters, setting the stage for advances in engineering and computing for disasters. It will increase the availability of training data for CV/ML and serve as a testbed for transfer of learned features from other disasters; both of which could lead to fundamental advances in machine learning. From a human-factors perspective, it will generate a new methodology for creating human-robot datasets that combine on-site direct data (with no experimenters in the field) with post-event data. This methodology would overcome current barriers in conducting empirical investigations into scientific questions on extreme work environments because of the prohibition on embedded experimenters. This methodology is expected to transfer to other extreme work environments, such as nuclear, space, oil and gas industry, and the military. The human-robot data itself could lead to major findings in human error and workforce training. From a geospatial perspective, the data can help establish the impact of rising sea levels, the built environment, and prior storm surge and flooding mitigations. Overall, the project will benefit society by increasing the ability to save lives and accelerate economic recovery after a disaster with UAS and is expected to create findings and methods that will generalize to new technologies for extreme environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project?s goal is to create a professional environment that effectively supports the inclusion and success of women with multiple identities in STEM. The ADVANCE team will take an intersectional approach to evaluate how individuals? multiple identities impact their professional experiences. The project aims to provide significant insight into workload distribution, resource allocation, professional advancement, concerns regarding inclusivity on campus, and factors that serve as barriers and facilitators to professional success. The project will lead to important understanding of issues related to gender equity and intersectionality for faculty at primarily undergraduate universities. Further, the ADVANCE team will aim to begin implementing targeted changes and develop a strategic plan to address observed inequities and challenges to success. <br/><br/>Using a mixed methods approach, specifically a sequential explanatory design, the ADVANCE Catalyst project will examine the institutional context for women in STEM at Christopher Newport University. The project will assess institutional data and survey faculty about their perspectives and campus culture. Themes about women?s roles and identities in their professional lives and productivity identified by analyzing the institutional and survey data will be used to develop questions for interviews with faculty and university administrators. The institutional, survey, and interview data will be used to 1) identify policies and practices that affect satisfaction, promotion, and retention of women and underrepresented minority (URM) faculty and, 2) develop a 5-year data-driven plan to remedy any identified systemic inequities or barriers to success.  The creation and implementation of the five-year strategic plan from this grant will support equity among STEM faculty at Christopher Newport University and is intended to have sustainable effects on the recruitment, retention, and promotion of women with multiple identities (e.g., parenthood, sexual orientation/gender identification). The intersectional approach will generate new knowledge about the experiences of STEM faculty and serve as a catalyst for change at Christopher Newport University as well as at other similar institutions.<br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.

Any passenger in a moving vehicle is subject to inertial forces associated with accelerations (e.g., speeding up, braking, turning, etc.). These inertial forces cause the passenger?s head and body to sway, which along with visual inputs, may lead to motion sickness and discomfort. One in three adults in the US is prone to motion sickness in moving vehicles. The goal of this project is to validate the need and commercial potential of a new motion sickness mitigation technology for the automotive and trucking industries that makes use of predictive algorithms to anticipate impending actions of a moving vehicle and their impact on the passenger.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel technology that makes use of predictive algorithms that employ real-time and historical data to predict the actions of moving vehicles, specifically those actions that lead to passenger discomfort and motion sickness. These predictions may be used to provide preemptive cues to the passenger via auditory, visual, and/or haptic stimuli to make them aware of the impending motion events. The goal of this research is to determine which combination of these cues and what time horizon of preemption is ideally suited to provide the passenger sufficient forewarning that can lower motion sickness. Preliminary results have shown the efficacy of such preemptive cues under specific conditions. This project may enable the development and testing of key hypotheses related to commercialization of this motion sickness mitigation technology in the automotive and trucking industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experimental studies on the impact of vertical accelerations on building response rarely have been conducted. Thus, numerical models cannot account for realistic data to predict the performance of building components. In this study, a near full-scale ten-story steel building will be instrumented to measure its vertical accelerations when tested on a shake table. The experimental data will be used to create numerical models to understand the behavior of beams, columns, slabs, and other components under vertical and horizontal seismic ground motions. The numerical models will be modified according to American design specifications to predict the seismic performance of steel buildings designed according to these standards and guidelines. Therefore, this research will improve the performance of steel buildings in seismic regions of the United States and provide much needed data for investigations on the vibration effects of beams and slabs on building occupants. The project will also support two Ph.D. students in the earthquake engineering field. The research outcomes will be disseminated through reports and journal publications. This project will contribute to the National Science Foundation (NSF) role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. Data from this project will be archived in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org).<br/><br/>This study is a collaboration with the Japanese National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED) research team that will test the ten-story steel building on the 3D Full-Scale Earthquake Testing Facility (E-Defense) six-degrees-of-freedom shake table operated by NIED and located in Miki, Japan. The steel building includes moment resisting frames in the transverse direction and a dual system in the longitudinal direction consisting of interior buckling-restrained braced frames and exterior moment resisting frames. Non-structural components will be installed on several floors, as well as curtain walls. The structure will be subjected to ground motions with monotonically increasing seismic intensity, and structural components are expected to exhibit nonlinear inelastic behavior in the final stages of the experiment. The study tasks consist of i) implementing an instrumentation network in the ten-story steel building to collect accelerations and deformations on structural components during three-dimensional seismic shaking, ii) creating subassembly and system finite element models using research and commercial software platforms, resulting in validated modeling techniques to capture the impact of three-dimensional excitations, and iii) assessing the implications of vertical seismic demands on the structural resiliency of steel buildings designed according to U.S. practice.

They can be packaged to run in a lightweight isolated execution environment (containers) and deployed on computing resources rented from public cloud providers, which can be updated and scaled seamlessly. However, the complex inter-container correlations and the heterogeneity of hardware resources pose significant challenges in managing these big data analytics applications in the public cloud. This project enables the easy deployment of containerized big data analytics applications in the public cloud and provides cloud providers with insights to better tune their systems for current and future big data workloads.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a scalable and deployable cyber infrastructure (CI) container orchestration toolkit for deploying large numbers of containerized big data analytics applications on heterogeneous nodes in state-of-the-art public multi/hybrid-cloud. This project spans three complementary thrusts: (i) a novel ?black-box? lightweight tool is implemented, which detects inter-container correlations for containerized big data analytics applications in a non-intrusive manner via hierarchical clustering and co-occurrence analysis; (ii) a novel scalable container scheduler is implemented, which deploys containerized big data analytics applications on heterogeneous nodes in the public cloud in a correlation-aware manner; and (iii) the system is implemented on open-source container orchestration tools and validated by subjecting it to experimentation on both the lab-based prototype and the practical, real-world data centers.

The development of DNNs suitable for real-world deployment requires formally proving that they satisfy a large number of trustworthy specifications (e.g., robustness, safety, fairness). If they do not, then the DNNs are iteratively repaired or re-trained until they are formally proven to be trustworthy. Overall, trustworthy DNN development requires calling a DNN verifier a large number of times for different specifications and DNNs. Each call to a DNN verifier is computationally demanding and while there has been plenty of work on improving the precision and scalability of state-of-the-art verifiers for verifying individual DNNs and specifications in recent years, the existing verifiers remain fundamentally non-scalable and unsustainable for trustworthy development of DNNs. This is because the expensive verifier needs to be run from scratch for every new pair of specifications and DNNs. The project novelties are in overcoming this barrier by the design of new concepts, theories, algorithms, and representations to enable incremental verification of DNNs. The project's impacts are making DNN verification more scalable, sustainable, and accessible. This allows scalable development of trustworthy DNNs thus ensuring that this technology realizes its true potential in transforming the society and economy.   <br/><br/>The project introduces the new concepts of proof sharing and proof transfer for enabling incremental DNN verification. Proof sharing makes the verification of multiple specifications on the same DNN more scalable and precise by computing a common proof for multiple specifications. Proof transfer boosts the verification across multiple networks by transferring the proofs generated on one network for multiple similar networks. Precision, speed, and memory gains from incremental verification are further improved by designing new mechanisms for DNN training and repair. The frameworks and tools for incremental DNN verification designed in this project are general, and compatible with diverse methods for DNN training, repair, and verification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to quantify and measure the value of data is critical to the entire ML lifecycle: from identifying useful data sources, to setting propriety over samples during training, and to interpreting the reason why certain behaviors of a model emerge during deployment. The potential of data valuation has been observed in many applications over the past few years. However, intermixed with these positive results is a vast array of applications for which existing data valuation techniques are not yet applicable, or too expensive to execute, or produce valuation results with substantial uncertainty. This project aims to enable data valuation to overcome applicability, scalability, and reproducibility challenges and transition to a practical and reliable tool for a data-centric future.

Specifically, the research focuses on the discovery and design of catalysts that enable efficient nitrate-to-ammonia transformation driven by renewable electricity. Beyond the technical aspects, the project will train students from diverse groups at the interface of catalysis, chemistry, and engineering.  The research will be integrated with educational and outreach efforts to illustrate the importance of sustainability in daily life while stimulating excitement for STEM amongst K-12 youth, especially those from low-income families. <br/><br/>The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a potentially attractive distributed NH3 production route, because it utilizes nitrate pollutants as the N-source, thus circumventing activation of the strong N?N triple bond associated with the H-B process.  The project will develop design strategies for single-atom alloy (SAA) electrocatalysts for the NO3RR and advance the fundamental understanding of both the catalytic active sites and the elementary mechanisms. The project is built on the central hypothesis that surface doping of Cu nanocrystals with isolated metal atoms (for example, Pt, Pd, Rh, or Ru) creates well-defined sites that activate water molecules and generate H-atoms that spill over to the Cu. The H-atoms hydrogenate N-species at low overpotentials and selectively tailoring of the binding strength of NO3RR surface intermediates through narrowly distributed d-states of single atoms for high-rate production of NH3, can potentially go beyond adsorption-energy scaling limitations. Catalyst synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical evaluation will be facilitated by advanced characterization techniques including operando surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, advanced electron microscopy, and computational tools such as density functional theory. The educational components of the project include (1) integrating research into the curriculum, (2) interdisciplinary student training, (3) involving diverse underrepresented students in science and engineering, and (4) implementing STEM-based outreach programs through the Center for Enhancement of Engineering Diversity at Virginia Tech and summer programs at Wonder Universe: A Children?s Museum.

This will occur because the geologic structures beneath the Earth?s surface act as a wave guide channeling earthquake waves into downtown Los Angeles. It has been shown that the ground motions one can expect could be a factor of four larger than what earthquake hazard models predict. This difference may significantly increase damages resulting from earthquakes.  It should also be accounted for when planning for earthquake resilience in the greater Los Angeles area. The inaccurate estimates for ground shaking result from incomplete Earth models which do not properly represent the geologic structures that channel seismic energy. Here, the researchers build a more detailed Earth model of the region.  They use recordings from a new style of seismic field experiment carried out between 2017 and 2020; it consisted of laying out more than 700 modern instruments along 10 lines across the study area.  This dense geometry allows the team to image better than ever before the subterranean structures channeling earthquake energy. The researchers carry out a full suite of analyses of the dense dataset.  They refine and update models for regional seismic velocity. They simulate expected ground motions accounting for the new findings. The new Earth models are made available to the scientific community by updating the Southern California Earthquake Center community velocity models; this is done using a newly developed platform for embedding high-resolution models into larger-scale regional models. Results of the study improve seismic hazard assessment in the Los Angeles area. This collaborative project also supports a female early-career scientist from an underrepresented group, and graduate and undergraduate students at Louisiana State University and the California Institute of Technology. <br/><br/>The researchers use receiver functions to construct profiles of the structure along each of the lines, using several teleseismic events that were recorded. The three-dimensional (3-D) shear wave velocities for the basins will be obtained from surface wave analysis based on ambient noise correlation between the nodes and broadband stations that were deployed as part of the survey, and the Southern California Seismic Network stations in the region. They combine the profiles and 3-D shear wave velocity estimates by using the gravity data across the basins. They produce attenuation (QS and QP) models from ambient noise and local earthquakes. The expected result will be a 3-D Earth model for the basins with a well-defined basement interface and shear wave velocities down through the sedimentary layers obtained at a higher resolution than existing models. As a further step, the team will simulate earthquake ground motions with the new model and compare strong motions to those predicted from noise correlations. The unique geometry of the survey allows the team to try more advanced methods including level-set inversion, autocorrelation methods, and possibly full waveform inversion. This advances the application of some of these methodologies for the first time to this particular type of data set. The full suite of methodologies developed here will be applicable other major cities around the world that are located on sedimentary basins such as San Francisco, Seattle, Mexico City and Lima.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many researchers have attributed this success to people?s ability to rapidly predict upcoming words. Previous studies have demonstrated various kinds of evidence for prediction mechanisms, e.g., more predictable words are read more quickly. But less is known about the mechanisms by which predictions are generated. This project investigates these mechanisms, by focusing on situations where people appear to make inappropriate predictions. A useful test case is ?role reversed? sentence pairs, such as ?the customer that the waitress had served? and ?the waitress that the customer served?, in which who did what to whom is reversed. Some psycholinguistic measures of prediction, particularly those involving comprehension, suggest that the verb ?served? is equally expected in both sentences, despite being inappropriate in the second. This has been taken as evidence that humans ignore the roles of nouns when generating expectations. However, some other measures of prediction suggest that humans generate appropriate expectations in those same sentences, making full use of role information. This project seeks to resolve this discrepancy. <br/><br/>The project combines computational and experimental methods to investigate why different measures indicate a greater or lesser role for semantic roles in moment-by-moment prediction in language. The project will develop a computational model of linguistic prediction that seeks to capture how a shared set of cognitive processes maps onto different experimental measures. The model will be extended based on results from new experiments. In order to understand the time course of predictions and the contributions of different task elements, the experiments will systematically vary whether or not participants are shown anomalous continuations, and what kind of response participants are required to give.

This project not only sheds light on the multifaceted nature of the relationship between social, financial, and legal sectors that shape perceptions of late-life care but also reveals the assumptions and beliefs about older adults ingrained within the legal, financial, and kinship networks. Moreover, it generates a novel understanding of how elders reconfigure and co-construct legal and financial settings through their daily practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their close integration with high-performance multi-core CPU architectures is also allowing very efficient heterogeneous computing. Going forward, it is imperative that such GPU-based systems scale both in terms of performance and energy efficiency to meet the exascale (and beyond) computing demands of the future. However, sustained scaling of these systems is challenging primarily because a) fabricating a single large die provides very low yield, making it prohibitively expensive, b) memory hierarchy remains a critical performance and energy efficiency bottleneck, and c) programmability and application scalability is hindered by inefficiencies in the shared virtual memory and multi-application support.<br/><br/>This project seeks to address these scalability challenges by rethinking the design of future large-scale GPU-based systems. In particular, this research project revolves around three major components: a) design space exploration of cores (including their organization) and the entire memory hierarchy, b) development of data movement optimization techniques by identifying and then exploiting cache locality via novel synergistic caching and scheduling techniques, and c) improving resource utilization of large-scale system resources by enhancing shared virtual memory and multi-application execution support. All three research components will be evaluated on a newly-developed comprehensive evaluation infrastructure. The findings of this research will be incorporated into new and existing undergraduate and graduate courses. It is expected that the insights resulting from this research would have a long-term positive impact on GPU-based computing, thereby making our daily lives more productive."

Advances in cloud computing have enabled integration of field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGAs) in high-end platforms for domain-specific customization. However, such FPGA-as-a-service systems are vulnerable to malicious attacks and countermeasures are needed to ensure that these systems can be deployed with high assurance. Today's security solutions are not sufficient for next-generation platforms in which intellectual property (IP) blocks from different providers are integrated on the same FPGA fabric; they access shared computational resources and incorporate applications from potentially untrusted sources. <br/><br/>This research is based on a combination of authentication methods, information flow tracking, shadow logic, formal methods, and the monitoring of on-chip sensors. Machine learning is utilized to detect malicious FPGA bitstreams. Authentication methods are being used to secure FPGAs against denial-of-service attacks due to greedy tenants, task-redirection, task-hiding, and temporal-instance attacks. Shadow logic and information flow tracking are used to secure the FPGA and other IPs against data-sniffing and data-modification attacks. Evaluation is being carried out  using a Digilent Genesys 2 board with an embedded Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA, and a ZedBoard Zynq-7000 development board.<br/><br/>Threat modeling, attack prediction, and proactive countermeasures will contribute to trust assurance in FPGA-as-a-Service systems.

A major challenge for environmental sustainability is to help semi-arid communities thrive by ensuring that cities, agriculture, and the environment are jointly water-secure. One successfully demonstrated option to meet growing water demands with the same water supply is reducing urban water use through efficiency. Urban lawn irrigation is now the primary target for reducing urban water use, as it dominates annual water use in many semi-arid cities. Cutting urban water use through irrigation efficiency could play a critical role in water-scarce river basins, but is presently limited by the potential unintended consequences of streamflow reduction from less runoff and groundwater flowing into streams. If we transform semi-arid cities to use less water outdoors, will urban streams run dry? Will major rivers flowing through semi-arid cities become trickles, with all the associated damage to ecology, recreation, and downstream water availability? The lack of fundamental scientific knowledge on how urban irrigation affects streamflow has limited the implementation of water-efficient urban irrigation systems in some parts of the semi-arid U.S. The purpose of this work is to predict the effects of reduced urban irrigation on streamflow, enhance the capacity of urban areas to manage scarce water resources, and ultimately contribute to the goal of thriving, sustainable semi-arid communities. The project will establish a mentoring program for underrepresented minority students interested in water careers and engage these students in hands-on urban water research. This project is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences Program and the Environmental Sustainability Program.<br/><br/>Reducing urban irrigation could play a critical role in achieving water security and sustainability in river basins where water is scarce. Urban irrigation may be reduced through smart, efficient irrigation systems or lawn conversion to xeriscaping and impervious surfaces. This work will quantify the present contribution of lawn irrigation to streamflow in small, semi-arid urban watersheds. This will be achieved in the Denver, Colorado, U.S. area by developing and applying a novel method combining water isotopes as a tracer of tap water with water provider reports, and monitoring in experimental watersheds. Then, using irrigation plots and integrated subsurface-surface-land surface hydrologic modeling, this research will determine the effects of reduced urban irrigation on semi-arid groundwater recharge and surface runoff. Lastly, this work will evaluate the hydrologic significance of present and reduced urban irrigation on streamflow in the semi-arid urban corridor of a large river basin. This research will integrate tightly with an education plan to diversify the urban water workforce in Colorado.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Species at both poles have independently evolved ways to deal with constant cold temperature, including the evolution of antifreeze proteins. Under freezing conditions, these compounds attach to ice crystals and prevent their growth. This lowers the tissue freezing point and reduces the chance the animal will be injured or killed. While it might seem that the need for unique adaptations to survive in polar waters would reduce species diversity in these habitats, recent evidence showed higher speciation rates in fishes from polar environments as compared to those found in warmer waters. This is despite the fact cold temperatures slow cellular processes, which had been expected to lower rates of molecular evolution in these species. To determine how rates of speciation and molecular evolution are linked in marine fishes, this project will compare the genomes of multiple polar and non-polar fishes. By doing so, it will (1) clarify how rates of evolution vary in polar environments, (2) identify general trends that shape the adaptive trajectories of polar fishes, and (3) determine how functional differences shape the evolution of novel compounds such as the antifreeze proteins some polar fishes rely upon to survive. In addition to training a new generation of scientists, the project will develop curriculum and outreach activities for elementary and undergraduate science courses. Materials will be delivered in classrooms across the western United States, with a focus on rural schools as part of a network for promoting evolutionary education in rural communities.<br/><br/>To better understand the biology of polar fishes and the evolution of antifreeze proteins (AFPs), this research will compare the evolutionary histories of cold-adapted organisms to those of related non-polar species from both a genotypic and phenotypic context. In doing so, this research will test whether evolutionary rates are slowed in polar environments, perhaps due to constraints on cellular processes. It will also evaluate the effects of positive selection and the relaxation of selection on genes and pathways, both of which appear to be key adaptive strategies involved in the adaptation to polar environments. To address specific mechanisms by which extreme adaptation occurs, researchers will determine how global gradients of temperature and dissolved oxygen shape genome variation and influence adaptive trajectories among multiple species of eelpouts (family Zoarcidae). An in-vitro experimental approach will then be used to test functional hypotheses about the role of copy number variation in AFP evolution, and how and why multiple antifreeze protein isoforms have evolved.  By comparing the genomes of multiple polar and non-polar fishes, the project will clarify how rates of evolution vary in polar environments, identify general trends that shape the adaptive trajectories of cold-adapted marine fishes, and determine how functional differences shape the evolution of novel proteins. This project addresses the strategic programmatic aim to provide a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of organismal adaptations to their current environment and ways in which polar fishes may respond to changing conditions over different evolutionary time scales.

Teams of robots, however, are extremely clumsy at coordination, requiring extensive communication and computation. Reliance on this infrastructure poses a significant roadblock to bringing robot teams into real-world applications. This project is pursuing an integrated research, education, and outreach approach for developing novel, data-driven algorithms for multi-robot coordination, inspired by human coordination. As cognitive beings that make decisions based on broad context, memory, and sensing, human capabilities are challenging to transfer to robotics. To facilitate this transfer, the project is developing an online crowdsourcing application that tasks participants with creating a global structure, such as a shape. The application constrains participants to robot-like capabilities by limiting available information and actions. The application will provide a faithful representation of the capabilities of distributed teams of robots, and will be used to gain insights into human coordination that can then be transferred to a multi-robot system.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the proposed work is to develop novel methodologies for multi robot coordination firmly grounded in human collaboration, based on models learned from data collected via a crowdsourced online application. To this end, the research objectives are (1) to explicate the relationship between context (communication and sensing) and outcomes in distributed teams of humans working on tightly coupled tasks using data generated from an online multi-person interface; (2) to identify, using statistical methods, parameters for distributed teams of robots solving similar shared objective problems; (3) to infer, using deep learning architectures, diverse ensembles of coordination models for distributed teams of robots solving tightly coupled problems using the data collected from the crowdsourcing application; and (4) to validate these models by evaluating their success in solving tightly coupled problems using a combination of simulation, hardware, and mixed reality experiments."

Prior to sequencing a biological sample, DNA must be liberated from cells and separated from proteins and other unwanted debris, and then mixed with specialty buffers and chemical agents. This skilled task is currently carried out by trained scientists using largely manual manipulations of the samples and expensive equipment. The alternative method proposed in this project will speed-up diagnoses from genomic sequencing by significantly reducing preparation time while also making preparation more reliable through automation. Notably, the proposed approach is expected to prepare DNA without reducing its length; consequently, the process should be ideally suited for preparing samples for emerging long-read sequencing technologies. These improvements have the potential to decrease the burden and costs associated with DNA sequencing, hence expanding the benefits of DNA sequencing technology to wider segments of society.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relies upon a process for trapping genomic material in a small flow cell through which an electric field and pressure-driven flow are simultaneously applied. The process is highly selective towards strands of DNA or (ribonucleic acid) RNA; proteins and other, unwanted debris that enters the flow cell passes through. Also, the process is relatively gentle, so the length of sample should not be shortened as a result. This project will advance the technology to the marketplace by: (1) Completing cartridge design details and fabrication, including evaluation of material options; (2) Building a custom research and development platform for interfacing with the cartridges; (3) Developing methods for DNA sample extraction and transfer; (4) Developing the library preparation protocols using mixing and heating while toggling the Electro-Hydrodynamic Trapping; and, (5) Integrating the entirety of the preparation process into a single cartridge and validating the process performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A significant amount of rehabilitation efforts, chemicals, and conservative design approaches are currently used to maintain cold-region infrastructure in serviceable conditions.

Through these processes, material removed from higher elevation areas by weathering and erosion is mechanically transported to lower elevation regions (i.e., basins), thereby leveling topographic highs (e.g., mountains). Studying and understanding these processes in a quantitative way provides Earth Scientists with fundamental information about geography, evolution, human migration, climate, tectonics, and the development of economically important sedimentary basins. One of the most robust ways to study sediment transport in modern and ancient sedimentary systems (e.g., rivers, deserts), is by measuring the geologic ages of weathering-resistant minerals such as zircon that contain radioactive parent and daughter isotopes. By studying the age patterns of far-travelled zircons, Earth Scientists can draw linkages to potential source areas with comparable ages and reconstruct ancient sediment routing systems. Students will be trained in the research methods and a new Creative Inquiry course for undergraduates will be developed as part of the project.<br/><br/>Studying sediment transport through age-dating of detrital minerals is not without complexities and potential biases. Although the mechanical sorting and fractionation of particles carried by tractive currents have been well-known processes in sedimentology for well over a century, our knowledge of how sediment transport affects detrital zircon populations and influences U-Pb age spectra remains critically inadequate. Using fluvial systems as natural laboratories, this project will quantify the effects that the physical characteristics of zircon, such as grain size, morphology, and accumulated radiation damage, have in systematically biasing detrital zircon age spectra during transport. This project will: 1) collect robust age and physical-properties information of detrital zircon fractionation during transport, and 2) apply methods of statistical inference to quantify the latent effects these physical characteristics have in biasing the observed age spectra. These insights will allow Earth Scientists to perform more ?geologically informed? inter-sample comparisons, enhancing the accuracy of tectonic reconstructions, quantitative provenance models, and sediment-transport pathways derived from detrital zircon U-Pb data.

Researchers use SAGE to gain valuable insights into fundamental Earth processes, and SAGE also provides key data for national security needs, including monitoring efforts of clandestine nuclear tests. The scientific priorities of the new facility would enable advances in the following areas: (1) Global Earth Structure and Dynamics: The facility would enhance our ability to resolve the three-dimensional structure of the Earth's interior and enable investigators to study processes that drive plate tectonics and natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. (2) Fault Zones and the Earthquake Cycle: Over the last decade, scientists have discovered a broad array of fault zone slip behaviors that span a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales. The SAGE facility will enable a variety of seismic and electromagnetic measurements to elucidate how these different types of behaviors start and stop, vary along fault zones, and interact with one another. (3) Magmas and Volatiles in the Crust and Mantle: Geophysical instrumentation is critical for understanding volcanic systems and minimizing risks associated with volcanic hazards. The capabilities provided by SAGE will enable researchers to study melt production, monitor its transport through the crust, and map out the plumbing systems of volcanoes. (4) Hydrosphere, Cryosphere, and Atmosphere: An area of increasing community interest is utilizing geophysical measurements to study processes at the Earth's surface. The SAGE facility will provide opportunities to study processes in the near-surface, such as hydrology, cryospheric processes, and glacier dynamics. (5) Education, Public Outreach, and Workforce Development: SAGE will develop a variety of educational resources and enable hundreds of undergraduate research opportunities.

While there exist numerous techniques for approximating solutions to many types of PDEs, it is the case that certain problems of practical interest exhibit various types of pathology, which render many standard techniques either highly inefficient or unusable. Such situations often arise in the setting of nonlinear problems which are posed in high dimensions or exhibit singularities, such as in the study of solid-fuel combustion optimization, oil pipeline corrosion predictions, and high-frequency financial trading. This project intends to provide means of circumventing the aforementioned issues through the rigorous study and development of so-called structure-preserving deep neural networks (DNNs). While it has been experimentally observed that DNNs provide highly capable methods of approximating solutions to a large class of problems, it is the case that the theoretical justification of such observations is still in its early stage. To that end, this project will provide a much-needed theory for certain classes of high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs via a two-pronged approach: namely, explicit randomized methods will be constructed which demonstrate desired properties while simultaneously developing theoretical tools representing and studying a large class of objects via DNNs. This approach requires the use of numerous tools from applied mathematics, functional analysis, stochastic analysis, and novel DNN computations. This unique intersection of techniques will serve as the basis for the project's educational and training components, which aim to increase the presence of women, minorities, and other underrepresented groups in mathematical research. This goal will be accomplished through the training and mentoring first-generation and underrepresented students at both graduate and undergraduate levels.<br/><br/>This project aims to address the question of whether or not it can be rigorously proven that there exist DNNs to approximate solutions to a large class of high-dimensional PDEs without suffering from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). The demonstration that DNNs are able to represent solutions to certain classes of high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs with a prescribed accuracy while not suffering from the CoD will fill a gap in the existing theory regarding machine learning algorithms. While the current focus is on studying the expressibility of DNNs with regard to solutions of PDEs, it is the case that this work will also serve as the foundation for extending such studies to other types of problems. This project will extend the existing theory of multilevel Picard (MLP) approximation methods to more general high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs, focusing on preserving inherent qualitative structures. The study of MLP approximations will also result in novel theoretical results regarding various stochastic fixed-point equations.

Islanded communities, defined as remote, self-contained regions, with low or intermittent physical (or cyber) connectivity, are especially vulnerable to natural disasters. A recent example is the extraordinary case of the island of Puerto Rico (PR), in the direct path of Hurricane Maria, and the near total failure of lifeline infrastructures. This event also exemplifies how extreme events compound endemic physical, social and economic vulnerabilities often present in remote or isolated communities. The associated cascading impacts, prior to and after Hurricane Maria, are clear evidence of our limited knowledge and readiness to anticipate risks in these complex engineered, physical and human systems. This reveals the urgent need to develop scientific and social frameworks and methodologies by which islanded communities can assess their existing preparedness to extreme climatic events, and through a multi-stakeholder engagement process and engineering analysis, evaluate and implement alternative measures to enhance the resiliency of such communities. Using PR as the case study, this Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) project will develop a data-driven modeling framework for understanding the complex physical and social vulnerabilities, and interdependencies that can and have resulted in near total failure of infrastructure systems.<br/><br/>The research questions that will be addressed include: a) How do socio-economic stability, governance and baseline conditions of  infrastructure impact performance and resiliency of critical interdependent infrastructure systems in extreme weather conditions? b) What knowledge and methods are needed to guide strategies for enhancing system resiliency and restoration in islanded communities? c) How can experts and stakeholders be engaged and informed about enhancing resiliency and effective failure mitigation strategies? The plan to achieve these objectives is by first implementing a data-driven process of gathering human narratives as social data and a source of information to recreate the timeline and experience of Hurricane Maria, before, during and after the event. Next, the project team will develop an integrated modeling and simulation framework, based on multi-layer distribution network theory. This framework will include structural-based assessment results in the modeling of infrastructure behavior during and after a disaster. The focus of study will be on the interdependencies of the electrical power, water distribution and communications systems. An objective is to recreate, via simulation, the event using a combination of system network models, geophysical data, and community data, to capture the sequence of the cascading failures and the corresponding societal impact as the event unfolded and during post-event recovery efforts. The project team seeks to arrive at a level of understanding of this system of systems that will lead to informed solutions and recommendations that will minimize adverse impact, disruption, loss of life and suffering, in the face of future extreme events. The research builds on a wealth of expertise in weather and climate processes in the Caribbean, understanding of local critical infrastructure, experience in mining community narrative, and from proven methodologies for rebuilding resilient communities in post-Hurricane Sandy in the New York and New Jersey Metro Area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In theory, the chemical composition and the crystal shape of clinopyroxene can be used to extract information about the liquid from which the mineral formed (e.g., temperature, pressure, composition). When studying rock samples, the accuracy of such markers is critical in deciphering the dynamics of a large number of volcanic and magmatic systems, both on Earth and other planetary bodies. However, the crystallization processes of clinopyroxene are complex and still poorly understood, which hampers its potential as a tracer of magmas. The proposed work aims to refine the crystallization processes of clinopyroxene using a combination of laboratory experiments and advanced analytical methods. These results will complete previous datasets, provide new insights on the mineral at the microscopic scale, and pave the way for new research avenues. The tasks will nurture a collaboration between three academic institutes with premier experimental petrology laboratories (Brown University, the University of Hawaii, and the Universite de Lorraine), support the professional development of two early-career researchers, and provide a research opportunity for three undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Clinopyroxene is one of the most complex igneous minerals in terms of its variability in texture and chemical zoning. Even today, its intricate complexity stands as a significant roadblock to reconstructing the history of clinopyroxene-bearing magmas. The rationale for this project stems from former characterizations of natural samples bearing complex sector zoning, and previous experiments on clinopyroxene + melt systems. This new work will exploit a trio of experimental apparatuses to address a broad range of crystallization conditions: heating stage microscope, 1-atm gas mixing furnace, and piston cylinder. The investigations will focus on major- and trace-element composition (in fine-scale detail to capture intricate zoning), growth features (habits, melt and solid inclusions, crystal defects) and the crystallization kinetics of clinopyroxene during the cooling of synthetic and natural melts. The experimental products will be analyzed using optical, electron probe, and transmission electron microscopies, and laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry. The overarching goals are: to document the textural variation of clinopyroxene at various pressure, temperature, and cooling conditions; to establish the conditions (cooling rate, undercooling, melt composition) at which sector zoning occurs; and to examine major- and trace-element partitioning between clinopyroxene and melt, and between sectors in clinopyroxene. These goals are intended to advance the practical application of clinopyroxene thermobarometry, by establishing which sectors and elements faithfully record magmatic pressure-temperature conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These attacks?including phishing, data disclosure, denial of service, and ransomware attacks?threaten students? and schools? cyber safety and privacy by making their personal and educational information vulnerable. These increasing cybersecurity threats highlight a need for cybersecurity education targeted to school administrators and staff to ensure they are adequately prepared to decide which educational technologies to use and how to optimize their security configurations and features. This project will provide cybersecurity education directly to school administrators, technology support staff, and teachers across North Carolina through the novel Cybersecurity Awareness-Ask-Action (AAA) program. This professional development program will equip school educators with a deeper awareness of how to secure their educational technologies, the communication skills to enable them to ask security- and privacy-related questions of software providers, and critical information on how to act when they recognize a threat to the digital privacy and security of their schools.<br/><br/>The project has three goals. First, K-12 school personnel will identify and analyze educational technology applications for collection, storage, and access to different student and school data types.  Second, the project team will design and develop workshop modules for school administrators, technology support staff, and teachers. Last, the team will facilitate a summer Cybersecurity AAA program to implement the modules with school administrators, technology support staff, and teachers. Outcomes are expected to improve the cybersecurity protection of K-12 school systems and further secure their student data. Evaluation results will be used to improve training modules.

This approach includes methods to modify images in a manner that is difficult or impossible to detect with the human eye but that reliably reduce the accuracy of machine learning classifiers. Current adversarial machine learning techniques do allow end-users to perturb images that they intend to share online but these technologies have, to date, been developed and evaluated from a technology-centered perspective, rather than a human-centered perspective. It remains unclear whether consumers find the developed technologies useful and practical. This project re-designs these technologies to improve consumer acceptance. The project introduces a human-centered approach to designing and evaluating adversarial machine learning anti-surveillance technologies.  Collaboration with advocacy organizations for populations that bear especially high risks from automated surveillance of images shared online enhance the educational and research impacts of the proposed work.<br/><br/>The specific activities proposed involves the creation of a standardized set of measures through which developers of human-centered adversarial machine learning ask human evaluators to assess the quality and acceptability of perturbed images. When a standardized measure is created, a public repository of human quality assessments of adversarial machine learning anti-surveillance technologies will be created and seeded with evaluations of extant systems. The project also involves the creation of a differentiable-loss term that captures the aesthetic quality of adversarially perturbed images. The differentiable-loss term can be used to help generate adversarial examples that human users perceive to be high quality. An open-source implementation of this novel loss term for at least one popular machine learning library will make it easier for other researchers to use and build on this work in the creation of novel human-centered adversarial attacks against automated surveillance. The project also involves the use of co-design processes to develop a new and novel human-centered adversarial machine learning application that will allow end-users to touch-up images they choose to share online in a manner that is both aesthetically pleasing and that helps evade facial recognition and other forms of automated inferencing of personally-identifiable information.

Although the global leaf surface area is more than double the surface area of the earth, the drivers and functions of leaf microbes are still mostly unknown, particularly for trees. Because forests provide ecosystem services to humans, including climate mitigation, timber production, nutrient retention, water filtration, and habitat for diverse plants and animals, understanding the role of plant-associated microbes in forests is critical. Forests that house a diverse mixture of many tree species may be more productive than stands with only a single tree species, in part because of their interactions with microbes. However, natural forests are losing diversity worldwide, and nearly all forest plantations and restorations are planted as single species stands. This research project explores the value of forest biodiversity, including trees and their associated microbes, by linking the effects of tree diversity to leaf chemistry and the associated communities of leaf microbes, root microbes, and insects. By determining whether and how tree and microbial diversity affects important ecological functions like tree productivity, this project will help determine best practices for sustainable forests and silvicultural plantations. Additional project impacts include engagement with invested stakeholders through workshops, the development of a field-based ?Bugs and Microbiomes? educational module, and training opportunities for undergraduate interns, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to predict the effects of microbes on tree productivity during the critical canopy closure stage of forest establishment. Researchers will utilize a large scale (32 acres) tree biodiversity experiment established in 2013 in Edgewater, Maryland, USA. Specifically, the project will track how tree species diversity affects above and belowground microbial diversity, while simultaneously characterizing leaf chemistry, insect communities and damage, and tree productivity. Targeted laboratory experiments will further determine the strength and directionality of the relationships observed under field conditions. Finally, a quantitative modeling approach will be used to link project components to determine their individual and combined effects on tree productivity. The results will provide a model for understanding how changes in multiple components of plant diversity ultimately influence plant productivity over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recent literature on fairness in machine learning offers a third stream of knowledge that practitioners can readily tap into when designing their personnel selection systems, yet a lack of integration between the machine learning literature and the two conventional streams of knowledge leaves a considerable gap preventing their effective integration. This research project focuses on bridging the gap to establish machine learning as the third pillar for the design of personnel selection systems in human resource management. The outcomes of the project inform policy makers and technology developers the factors important to the fairness of personnel selection. It also facilitates discussions about the use of machine learning in human resource management, by better connecting the empirical research of personnel selection with the technical design of fair machine learning algorithms.<br/><br/>The research in the project is rooted in the substantive bodies of multidisciplinary knowledge it integrates to enable fair personnel selection in the current legal structure. Specifically, the project develops a theoretical framework demonstrating how different design characteristics of a personnel selection system, from predictor selection to staging designs, influence and shape the Pareto front (in terms of tradeoff between selection validity and fairness) achievable under the prevailing employment opportunity laws. The findings from the theoretical framework speak to the importance of alignment between the design characteristics of a personnel selection system and the machine learning algorithms used within. Consequently, a key component of the project is a series of research tasks that combine theory development, algorithmic design, system implementation, and empirical research to properly situate the machine learning techniques within the current legal and industrial environments for personnel selection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meiotic recombination is a process that determines how parental chromosomes pair up and generate crossovers during sexual reproduction in order to reciprocally exchange genetic material. This makes one individual different from another due to the new and unique combination of alleles. However, breeders rarely know which sex direction of artificial pollination to choose in order to obtain the alleles they need. In order to help breeders determine the direction of pollination that will most enhance their breeding, this project will compare the frequency of meiotic recombination between male and female in corn to understand whether and how meiotic recombination differs between the sexes. The data generated in this project will be used to develop two bioinformatics courses for undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in big data science and advanced plant science. To broaden project impact, a 5-day ?Bioinformatics in Plant Science? summer workshop with an emphasis on programming skills and cutting edge technologies will be held annually to train graduate, undergraduate, high school students, and particularly female students and students from underrepresented groups. Additionally, high school science teachers will be involved in this project to help them develop science projects for high school curriculum.<br/><br/>Recombination has been widely recognized for its role in promoting genetic diversity and largely impacts the efficiency of plant breeding. While enormous progress has been made to decipher the molecular mechanisms of meiotic recombination, how genetic and epigenetic factors are involved in this complicated process, and whether and how recombination differs between male and female meioses in maize are still poorly understood. This project seeks to investigate the meiotic recombination during male and female meioses by using the hybrids of parents of the maize nested association mapping (NAM) population with the reference line B73. These NAM lines were selected to compare male and female meioses because they maximize genetic diversity of the entire maize population. We will first identify the lines that show largest differences with respect to recombination frequency between sexes (Aim 1) and will generate high resolution recombination maps of these lines to compare crossovers between sexes at global and local scales (Aim 2). To determine the causes of such differences between sexes, we aim to elucidate genetic and epigenetic factors important for regulation and control of meiotic recombination (Aim 3). In addition to using the NAM hybrids, a mutant in a RNA directed DNA methylation pathway will be used to particularly dissect the roles of epigenetic modifications in meiotic recombination (Aim 3).

While advances in communication and computing technologies enable the concept of CAVs, the coupling of application, control and communication components of such systems and interference from human actors, pose significant challenges to designing systems that are safe and reliable beyond prototype environments. Realizing CAV applications, in particular in situations where humans may partly remain in the loop, requires addressing uncertainties that arise from human input. Large scale deployment of CAVs will also require addressing challenges in coordination of actions among CAVs and with human operated systems. To address these challenges, this project develops a novel model-based stochastic hybrid systems (SHS)-theoretic approach that relies on describing and communicating behaviors of actors in the system in the form of evolving SHS using Bayesian learning. The models are then utilized in a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) framework for optimal coordination of actions. The proposed research will provide wide-ranging societal benefits through three major impact areas: first, by advancing research in stochastic communication-aware control design for hybrid systems; second, through the development of new models and advanced controllers to address the emerging challenges of coordinating mixed systems of automated and manned vehicles, hence opening new vistas in other areas involving general multi-agent systems; and third, through educational and outreach activities that are natural extensions of this multidisciplinary research. This project is also the first fruits of a recent National Science Foundation/Deutsche Forschungs Gesellschaft (NSF/DFG) collaboration on cyber-physical systems (CPS).

These applications generate a large influx of sensor data at massive scales. Under many time-critical scenarios, these massive data streams must be processed in a very short time to derive actionable intelligence. This CAREER project aims to support time-critical IoT applications by applying the stream processing paradigm to the Edge computing architecture. The success of this research will benefit many time-critical IoT applications in the areas such as factory automation, the tactile internet, autonomous vehicles, and process automation. It will also substantially improve the performance profiles of a variety of data processing systems, such as wide-area data analytics systems, mobile data access systems, event tracking systems, and streaming databases. As an integral part of its research program, this CAREER project involves K-12, undergraduate and graduate level education in partnership with the local Public School system.<br/><br/>Specifically, this CAREER project will build a scalable and adaptive Edge stream processing engine, which enables fast stream processing of a large number of concurrent IoT queries in the dynamic, heterogeneous Edge environment. This work includes three primary research directions. First, a new dynamic dataflow graph abstraction will be implemented, which automatically chains, parallelizes and replicates stream operators to adapt to the Edge dynamics and handle failures in a scalable way. Second, a new customizable data shuffling service abstraction will be implemented, which customizes the data shuffling path (e.g., ring shuffle, hierarchical tree shuffle, butterfly wrap shuffle) at runtime for the given network topology and workload. Third, a fully decentralized architecture with many distributed schedulers will be implemented, in which each scheduler operates autonomously to process IoT queries.

To do so, this research study will conduct a meta-analysis of mathematics teaching strategies used in informal learning environments, such as museums, libraries, and the home. A meta-analysis examines published research data, paying close attention to differences in findings, and uses statistics to analyze the findings across different studies.  This meta-analysis will summarize the relevant research about mathematics teaching that has been published since 1980, focusing on children in preschool to the end of third grade. It will also focus on mathematics learning topics of numbers and operations, algebra, geometry, measurement, and data analysis. The researchers will include data from peer-reviewed research, conference proposals, reports, and dissertations. In choosing which research studies should be included in their analysis, the researchers will consider the specific teaching strategies used, the participants in the study, and the training that the adults received. The project intends use their analysis to show what effective mathematics teaching looks like in informal learning environments.  This information can provide insights about best mathematics teaching practices for young children in informal learning environments. In this way, it can benefit mathematics education by informing the decision-making of researchers, practitioners, parents, childcare providers, teacher educators. <br/><br/>After a thorough review of the literature and collection of relevant studies, the researchers will code each contributing study for methodological, participant, and intervention characteristics, study quality, and type of dependent measure. The researchers will also double code studies to establish inter-rater agreement to ensure consistency in coding procedures across reviewers. A random-effects meta-regression will then be used to synthesize standardized mean difference effect sizes to determine an overall average effect and evaluate coded moderators that may account for variability in the observed effects. Cluster robust variance estimation will be used to account for dependence between effect sizes collected from the same study. This project has the potential to make a unique contribution to the field by (a) responding to a recent upward trend of empirical research on mathematics interventions in informal learning environments; (b) reporting on the current quality of evidence of intervention studies as a means to improve future research studies in this area; (c) broadening stakeholders? knowledge base regarding training parents and childcare providers to implement effective mathematics interventions; and (d) implementing a rigorous research plan and meta-analytic techniques.

Further, the project explores the role of faculty, staff, and administrators in perpetuating or dismantling the perception of a high stress culture as a necessary factor for success in engineering. The outcomes of the project will support the improvement and development of proactive interventions to support positive mental health and well-being in undergraduate engineering programs. Improving undergraduate mental health in engineering programs will improve recruitment and retention in engineering programs, which in turn addresses the national need of training engineers to address grand challenges. The results of the project will also raise awareness of undergraduate mental health in engineering programs by facilitating discussions among faculty, staff, and administrators who directly impact the climate in undergraduate programs. These discussions will further serve to increase the adoption of research-based practices and interventions to support mental health and promote student well-being.<br/><br/>The integrated research and education plan supports the development of a culture of well-being in engineering undergraduate programs. Though culture and perceived norms have critical recruitment and retention implications, no research has examined the role of a high-stress culture, particularly for underrepresented students who may already face a ""chilly climate"" or ""climate of intimidation"". The project addresses this knowledge gap using a mixed methods design to connect factors within the control of educators to outcomes seemingly out of control (mental health). The project studies engineering culture through the lens of social identity theory to identify key factors in how the high-stress culture evolves through a longitudinal study that identifies student stressors and coping mechanisms. The results of the longitudinal study will identify patterns in student responses to this culture, which will be further analyzed by qualitative interviews with students from different groups. Further, the project will identify coping mechanisms utilized by students who resist the notion of a high stress culture, which will inform proactive trainings to promote student well-being. Understanding how students positively cope and thrive in engineering programs will inform proactive trainings and early interventions to promote mental wellness instead of reactive, deficit-based approaches. Building communities both locally and nationally will raise awareness of mental health in engineering, emphasize the need to develop positive culture, and promote wider implementations of research-based practices to support student well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The modulus of resilience provides the measure of a material?s ability to absorb and release elastic strain energy, determined by the ratio between strength and stiffness of these materials. In general, engineering the modulus of resilience is extremely difficult because it requires asymmetrically increasing strength and stiffness against their mutual scaling behavior. As an alternative route, this award supports fundamental research to elucidate how nanoparticles can be used to tune mechanical behaviors of their polymer composites for simultaneously achieving high strength and low stiffness. This knowledge will accelerate the design of high strength, yet compliant polymeric materials for a broad range of applications, such as light-weight elastic energy storage devices, protective coatings, flexible and foldable optoelectronics, and artificial muscles. Thus, this research will not only promote the progress of science, but also advance the national health, prosperity and welfare. It can also help to secure national defense through technological innovations, e.g. light-weight energy absorption and protection systems for aircrafts. By integrating multiple disciplines, this project will train a diverse group of students in the areas of mechanics of materials, polymer science, mechanical engineering, and material science and engineering for next-generation workforce development. The educational objectives of the project will be realized through curriculum development, undergraduate research opportunities, summer research program for high school students, research experience for K-12 teachers program, and K-12 outreach program. Special efforts will be made to involve underrepresented students in this project.<br/> <br/>The objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that the combination of high strength and low stiffness is attributed to the unique microstructure of polymer nanocomposites that contains spherical nanoparticles weakly interacting with soft polymer matrix. To achieve this objective, the research plan consists of two major aims. The goal of Aim 1 is to establish a research framework integrating multiscale molecular modeling and complementary nanomechanical experiments for studying polymer nanocomposites with high strength and low stiffness. It will be used to elucidate how the size of nanoparticles, in comparison with free volume elements of the polymer matrix, can influence mechanical behaviors of polymer nanocomposites. In Aim 2, the underpinning mechanics principle of attaining the combination of high strength and low stiffness will be generalized to guide exploration of a novel class of polymer nanocomposites. These nanocomposites with ultra-high elastic energy storage capability can be used for superior mechanical protection, artificial muscles, soft robotics and flexible electronics. The interdisciplinary effort will open promising avenues for quantitatively understanding the anomalous high strength and low stiffness behaviors, and offer mechanistic insights into the design principles of a novel class of nanocomposites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this, this project will make use of optical circuit switches, which can handle large data traffic flows with sparse connection patterns.  It will develop scheduling algorithms to manage when to connect servers via these switches, taking into account practical constraints associated with the switching hardware as well as practical systems constraints. Addressing this challenge will enable more efficient use of data center resources for data analytics and other computationally intensive tasks. <br/><br/>This project addresses the problem of fast dynamic switching for adaptation to datacenter traffic patterns.

In 2018 it was discovered that both of these enteric viruses are often found in small fluid-filled sacs called vesicles. These vesicle virus clusters are widely found in stool and have been detected in wastewater. Rotavirus and norovirus vesicles are more persistent, infectious, and resistant to disinfection compared to non-vesicle viral particles. In spite of these concerning findings, relatively limited research on the environmental behavior and fate of enteric virus vesicles has been performed to date. The goal of this project is to address this knowledge gap on rotavirus and norovirus vesicles in wastewater and natural aquatic systems. To achieve this goal, the team will (i) identify and quantify rotavirus and norovirus vesicles in wastewater, (ii) investigate their stability and infectivity in model natural water and wastewater systems, and (iii) evaluate their inactivation under exposure to sunlight. Successful completion of this project will result in new knowledge on the distribution, persistence, infectivity, and inactivation of enteric virus vesicles in wastewater and natural aquatic systems. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education, training, and outreach integrating project findings into course modules. The diversity of the Nation?s STEM workforce will be increased through the recruitment and mentoring of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The recent discovery of vesicle-cloaked clusters of rotovirus and norovirus particles in stool and wastewater presents a challenge to our current understanding of the environmental fate and health risks of waterborne viruses.

The goal of this research is to address these knowledge gaps by investigating the environmental fate and infectivity of rotovirus and norovirus vesicles. To achieve this goal, the research team will carry out an integrated experimental program organized around three specific tasks. In Task 1, experiments will focus on the recovery, characterization, and quantification of rotavirus/norovirus vesicles in hospital and municipal wastewater using reverse-transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR). In Task II, the PIs will characterize the stability and infectivity of rotavirus/norovirus vesicles in representative water matrices using a suite of analytical tools and assays including dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and integrated cell culture-reverse transcription quantitative PCR (ICC-RT-qPCR). In Task III, the PIs will investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of inactivation of rotavirus/norovirus vesicles under sunlight exposure using similar assays as in Task II.

In order for the methodology to be disseminated and used by energy stakeholders and future LCA practitioners, the education objectives are to: (1) design and share a course in geospatial LCA modeling; (2) develop and promote a workshop and website on these methods and their results for industry and policy stakeholders; and (3) provide a research group structure designed to recruit, train, and retain students in sustainability engineering fields. This project will develop methodology for determining life cycle climate change impacts of energy technologies that is more precise than previously used methods in LCA. The results will be statistically compared against non-geographically-specific LCA results of the same modeled technologies and against the impacts of fossil fuels to determine the significance of incorporating geospatial components in energy system LCAs. The developed geospatial LCA methods can also be utilized in LCA of other systems beyond energy technologies, such as mining, and can be used for energy system planning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditionally, long-term characteristics of sleep patterns (sleep phenotypes) are largely unknown due to the lack of convenient monitoring devices and automatic algorithms.  Recently, massive health sensing data such as activity data, electroencephalogram, respiratory monitoring data and electrocardiography are being collected in clinics and at home, which brings unprecedented opportunities for understanding sleep phenotypes outside clinics. However, there are tremendous challenges to translate these noisy and unreliable multimodal sensing data into accurate phenotypes such as sleep stages and apnea events. Beyond sleep, many neurological conditions such as Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s all expect objective tracking of long-term disease progression, which is currently impossible. This project will provide the computational capability to conduct phenotype tracking at home with the focus on sleep phenotypes. Machine learning methods and software will be developed to conduct accurate phenotyping of sleep with minimal effort on sensor instrumentation, data collection and analysis. <br/><br/><br/>This project aims at developing DeepSense, a deep learning toolbox to model massive data streams including in-clinic monitoring data such as polysomnography and novel radio frequency signals from a wireless sensing device. The research team will develop accurate deep learning methods to automate sleep monitoring using polysomnography data. They will invent adversarial deep learning methods for modeling radio frequency  signals and leverage large historical polysomnography data to help improve models for radio frequency signals. They will develop interpretable models that leverage and expand medical knowledge on sleep phenotypes. Finally, all the proposed models will be validated through a prospective study with a goal of automating manual sleep studies and assessing the feasibility of sleep studies via radio frequency signal data. The research team plans to release the open-source software and large datasets from this project that can benefit computer science, engineering and medical community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such sophisticated movements are often taken for granted.  A majority of individuals with a stroke, however, tend to have persistent hand functional deficits, limiting their ability of living independently.  Human-machine interactions hold great potential to restore motor functions of stroke survivors.  Recently advanced rehabilitative or assistive techniques (e.g., hand exoskeletons) have the ability to substantially enhance motor functions.  However, few of these state-of-the-art techniques have been successfully translated to end users, and one critical limiting factor is the challenge in controlling the many movement directions robustly.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-invasive and robust neural decoding approaches for human-machine interactions that can directly translate to clinical applications.  Accordingly, this project aims to decode the neural command sent from the brain that controls individual finger movements.  This is accomplished by reading activities in the spinal cord using muscle electrical signals obtained from the skin surface.  The decoded finger-specific neural command can then be used to control rehabilitation or assistive robots, which can substantially enhance the quality of human-machine interactions.  This approach can also facilitate wide applications of robotic rehabilitation or assistance in stroke survivors.  The non-invasive nature of the techniques has a great potential for readily clinical translations.  The proposed research will be integrated with education through graduate and undergraduate research involvement and new course development.  Summer projects and demonstration materials on human-machine interactions will be developed for K-12 students.  Outreach programs will be organized to expose the proposed research topics to underrepresented students, highlight the opportunities in science and engineering, and promote students interests in choosing future STEM careers.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's long-term research goal is to develop highly innovative non-invasive tools for human-machine interactions, with a particular interest in better understanding the neuromechanical properties of the upper extremity, and improve the functional performance in individuals with a central or peripheral injury.  Toward this goal, this project aims to decode the descending neural command that controls individual finger movements by extracting spinal motoneuron discharge activities using source separation of high-density electromyogram signals (HD-EMG) from finger muscles. The non-invasive, robust, and real-time neural decoding technique developed will be easy to implement, can accommodate the different impairment levels of individual stroke survivors, and will substantially improve the control quality of exoskeleton or neuroprosthesis. The Research Plan is organized under three aims.  The FIRST AIM is to develop non-invasive offline and real-time neural decoding approaches based on spinal motoneuron discharge probabilities at the population level that are directed at a designated finger.  This aim addresses the need for non-invasive human-machine interface signals that allow robust and intuitive interaction between humans and machines.  Surface EMG signals will be recorded over the targeted extrinsic muscles using an 8x16 channel electrode array with an inter-electrodedistance of 10 mm.  Motoneuron discharge activities will be obtained from different independent component analysis (ICA)-based HD EMG decomposition methods that will be evaluated on both simulated and experimental EMG data obtained from stroke survivors and healthy control subjects.  The decoding accuracy will be evaluated by comparing the decoded neural drive with finger force output and joint angles. Given that binary motoneuron discharge events are used, the decoded neural drive signals are expected to be robust to changes in action potential properties in the EMG signals, background noise, and motion artifacts. The evaluation of the performance and boundary conditions of different source separation algorithms can further ensure robust decoding performance in a variety of situations, especially in clinical populations.  The SECOND AIM is to classify the neural command specific to individual finger movements. This aim addresses the need for effective control of individual/flexible finger movement in developing human-machine interactions. Surface EMG signals will be recorded over the extrinsic forearm muscles using an 8x16 channel HD EMG electrode array and over the intrinsic extensors muscles to fingers using an 8x4 channel grid. Different features from HD EMG activities and from motor unit (MU) distributions will be extracted. With macro and micro level features, different muscle activation regions will be identified for individual fingers using pattern classification approaches. The neural drive associated with specific finger movement will then be calculated based on MU discharge activities of a specific finger. The classified neural command signals can enable robust and flexible control of individual finger movements non-invasively, and dramatically enhance the dexterity of hand function in clinical populations.  The THIRD AIM is to quantify the performance of the decoding technique by controlling a non-invasive neuroprosthesis for dexterous finger grasp patterns. A transcutaneous nerve stimulation technique developed in the PI's group will be used to elicit flexible individual and coordinated finger movements. The neural stimulation system targeting the affected hand of stroke survivors will be controlled by the decoded neural drive from the contralateral/unaffected arm (particularly if the stroke is severe) or from the affected arm, with time-sharing between stimulations and recordings. The force output (force absolute error and force variability) of neural drive controlled stimulation will be compared with the global EMG controlled stimulation to evaluate the performance of the neural decoding technique.  The overall outcomes of the project are expected to ultimately allow stroke survivors to intuitively interact with rehabilitative/assistive devices in a robust and non-invasive manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such cyber-physical systems, which include many vital infrastructures that sustain modern society (e.g., transportation systems, electric power distribution) are usually safety-critical. If compromised, serious harm to the controlled physical entities and the people operating or utilizing them as well as significant economic losses can result. However, model mismatches between the real system and an imperfect model of the system, in addition to other sources of uncertainties (e.g., measurement errors) disable existing safety and security protection, while robust solutions without learning may be overly conservative. These challenges demonstrate the need to design novel computational tools that can guarantee robust safety and security of cyber-physical systems under real-world uncertainties without sacrificing performance. The project includes research activities that are integrated with education and outreach to engage students and industry partners to appreciate the importance of safety and security for computing-related technologies.<br/><br/>To enable learning-aided robust safety and security for cyber-physical systems, this project will develop mathematical foundations and control synthesis algorithms based on set-membership and learning approaches for uncertainty quantification, secure/attack-resilient estimation and safe-by-design control. The research endeavor will produce novel scientific foundations representing: 1) a shift from the conventional average or stochastic characterization of uncertainty of machine learning- and/or physics-based models to a set-membership representation using hybrid inclusion, 2) a transition from secure point estimator designs to secure set-membership estimators with run-time learning of man-in-the-middle attack models/strategies, and 3) a progression from fixed safe-by-design control algorithms with uncompromised state feedback to attack-resilient output feedback designs with learning from run-time data.

For humans and machines to become true teammates?and correlatively, for technology to extend occupational opportunities to people with such neurodiversity?intelligent machines must assess, adapt, and respond to both workers and their environment. Such agility requires a reciprocal teaming capability wherein workers can engage their AI counterparts as more than tools, and AI systems can collaborate with workers seamlessly by predicting their behaviors. To extend future occupational opportunities for people with neurodiversity, this project builds an AI-driven learning platform to enable distribution of AI teammates in construction workplaces to support employment opportunities and safety outcomes for construction workers with varying abilities. This study also investigates the intended work scenarios of worker-AI teaming, the unintended consequences of AI-teaming for workers, and the well-being of society. Considering that 4.2% of workers are diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?a disorder that is associated with more than 120 million lost workdays in the USA each year, equating to a human capital value of $19.5 billion?this project?s efforts to enable diverse workforce participation in the construction industry will have positive social and economic impacts. Additionally, this project will educate a new generation of leaders in worker-AI teaming and will create partnerships between academia and industry.<br/><br/>To lay the necessary foundations for building this human-AI teaming workspace for construction workers with neurodiversity, this proof-of-concept project will translate non?invasive biomechanical and neuro-psychophysiological responses into information a personalized AI-based training systems can assess, model, and leverage to predict workers? behaviors for improved worker?machine teaming without cultivating technological over-reliance or threats to privacy. In this project, a multidisciplinary team of researchers integrates expertise in civil engineering, computer science, cognitive and behavioral psychology, industrial engineering, and public policy and economics to address fundamental questions regarding the risk taking behavior and cognitive processes of workers with ADHD, barriers to adopting AI and wearable technologies, and the socioeconomic impacts of improved access to construction jobs for ADHD-diagnosed workers, especially in the context of interdependent human-AI partnerships. As this project?s global paradigm moves toward deeper human-machine teaming, the knowledge gained through this project advances the science and technology that influences diverse workforce development, education, and positive work outcomes for workers and society at large.

This research seeks to understand how multiple sources of stress impact humans, free-ranging livestock, and wildlife in shared rangelands in the western US. Increasingly frequent and more severe droughts make plant forage for wild herbivores and cattle less predictable and abundant, even as the return of gray wolves to parts of the landscape increases predation risk. As a result, wildlife such as deer and elk, as well as free-ranging livestock, may be forced to trade off food and security, and ranchers grazing their cattle on public land may face more uncertainty. This research will assess (1) how drought and wolves interact to affect wild herbivores and free-ranging cattle distributions across the landscape, (2) how decision-makers respond to these two sources of stress, and (3) how information, provided via a new wildlife and plant forecasting application, is received and used by both ranchers and wildlife managers. The project will also increase public awareness of human and wildlife connections and interactions in rangeland ecosystems via a documentary film, as well as by training citizen scientists to classify camera-trapped images of rangeland wildlife. A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students as well as a post-doctoral researcher will be trained over the course of this project. Outcomes of this project include a better understanding of how climate and carnivore risks affect human decision-making, as well as how humans impact rangeland food webs via cattle stocking and wildlife removal, potentially leading to increased opportunities for coexistence between humans and wildlife in changing environments.<br/><br/>Ecological shifts brought about by climatic change can strongly interact with other sources of change, such as recolonizing large carnivores, to alter food web dynamics and potentially reduce ecosystem provisioning for humans. The uncertainty created by such interactions also challenges human decision-making. A critical gap exists in our knowledge of how climate change affects human-wildlife systems via wild food webs, and how natural resource decision-makers respond to such stress. We hypothesize that multiple environmental stressors (e.g., climate change and novel predators) will have complex and interactive effects on human-wildlife systems. Effects will likely occur via trophic interactions among predators, prey, domestic animals, and plants within shared food webs, potentially reducing the provisioning of humans from the shared ecosystem and human tolerance for predatory and competitive wildlife, and increasing uncertainty for natural resource decision-makers. There is a pressing need to advance models, tools and theory to (A) understand how multiple stressors interactively affect food webs in which humans and domestic animals are embedded, and (B) identify and quantify feedbacks among natural resource decision-makers and human-wildlife systems in response to multiple environmental stressors. Such information would assist in identifying potential ?tipping points? in system resiliency and allow for better management of interacting wildland and agricultural systems. Using a factorial design of study sites across combinations of wolf presence and drought in Oregon and Idaho, we will study rancher-wildlife-plant dynamics. Data will stem from rancher surveys, wildlife camera grids, and ground-surveyed and remotely-sensed plant data. We will integrate social and ecological data into a structural equation modeling framework, which will drive ecological forecasts of predation and competition risk to livestock for ranchers and managers to use in future decision making. To understand natural resource manager decisions, which occur at larger spatial scales than rancher decisions, we will conduct a broad-scale analysis of the rangeland SES across the Western US using publicly-available wildlife and social data and remotely-sensed environmental characteristics. By analyzing decision-making across these spatial scales, we anticipate being able to identify key feedbacks, emergent phenomena, and potential tipping points in resilience for the human and wildlife components of the rangeland SES.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Dynamics of Integrated Socio-Environmental Systems (DISES) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of interest to Dr. Bangasser?s laboratory, is the ability of stress to impair certain types of memory. Previous researchers have studied this question by exploring whether stress hormones directly impact a region critical for declarative (e.g., autobiographical) and spatial memory, called the hippocampus. However, the hippocampus is part of a memory circuit and it receives input from another region called the medial septum. The studies in this project will investigate how a stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor, impacts the medial septum of male and female rats to disrupt memory. Preliminary data indicate that females are more resilient to the memory deficits caused by corticotropin releasing factor and a goal of the project is to determine why. Experiments will evaluate how gonadal hormones and sex differences in corticotropin releasing factor binding protein ? which reduces the efficacy of corticotropin releasing factor ? promote female resilience to the memory defects caused by corticotropin releasing factor in the medial septum. Additionally, chemical changes in the hippocampus that result from corticotropin releasing factor in the medial septum will be investigated to better understand circuits by which stress can affect memory. The results may eventually be utilized to develop compounds that improve cognition in healthy subjects experiencing stress, as well as in patients with disorders characterized by stress dysregulation and mnemonic impairments (e.g., patients with schizophrenia and depression). <br/><br/><br/>Stress impairs hippocampus (HPC)-dependent memory, so many researchers investigate how stress hormones directly impact HPC function. Yet, the HPC does not work in isolation, but is regulated by afferent structures, such as cholinergic projections from the medial septum (MS). Dr. Bangasser?s laboratory discovered that the stress neuropeptide, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), administered to the MS impairs HPC-dependent spatial memory, and males are more sensitive to this effect. Female resilience to CRF in the MS was not due to ovarian hormones but was associated with an increase in CRF binding protein (CRF-BP), which reduces the bioavailability of CRF. This project will determine how this sex difference is established and how CRF in the MS regulates the HPC. Aim 1 will test whether testosterone mediates male vulnerability to the spatial memory deficit caused by CRF in the MS. Aim 2 will characterize the sex difference in CRF-BP in the MS by first determining the MS cell-type that expresses CRF-BP and identifying sex differences therein. Next, CRF-BP function will be blocked in females to see if it increases their sensitivity to the low dose of CRF in the MS, mimicking the male effect. Aim 3 will use amperometric recordings to confirm that CRF in the MS alters ACh release in the HPC. Then proper ACh levels will be restored to assess if this rescues the mnemonic deficit resulting from CRF in the MS. Collectively, these studies will determine how biological sex and CRF interact to drive vulnerability vs. resilience to stress-induced cognitive changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With a radius that is slightly larger than the planet Mars, the core sits roughly ~2900 km below Earth?s surface. The fluid outer core holds high importance for a number of reasons, including the generation of Earth?s magnetic field, and being an important mechanism to transfer heat to the mantle, which helps to drive the convective engine responsible for plate tectonics.  In the past few decades, geophysicists have detected a thin shell at the top of the outer core where seismic waves appear to slow down, suggesting some form of stratification in the fluid.  However, the seismic models for this shell do not all agree, which motivates further study. A principle challenge in seismically imaging the outer core is that seismic waves from earthquakes that are used to study the core have to travel through the entire mantle of the Earth twice (down and then back), and the mantle is very heterogeneous, with seismic velocities that vary with position.  Thus, how can seismologists determine if patterns in measured signals are due to anomalous outermost core structure versus heterogeneities in Earth?s mantle?  The purpose of this project is to document the degree to which the heterogeneous mantle affects the data which are used to map the core. The team of four seismologists will collect seismic data from earthquakes and seismic sensors from all over the world, predict the observations using state of the art seismic wavefield computations, and conduct refined measurements on the signals that are sensitive to deep mantle and outer core parts of the planet.  The expected outcome is a better understanding of the degree to which Earth?s heterogeneous mantle affects measurements of data to study the core, and to produce an improved model of the outermost core by using the best data which are demonstrated to be minimally affected by the mantle.  Better seismic mapping of Earth?s outermost core will inform research that aims to understand the enigmatic nature of the magnetic field, heat flow from the core to the mantle, as well as possible chemical exchange between the mantle and core which is important for understanding the chemical evolution of the planet.  All four seismologists on the team will share results with the public in a variety of venues (including the classroom, public presentations, and science fairs) to promote awareness of the importance of Earth and planetary interiors in shaping phenomena experienced at the surface. The project will train several graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Seismically imaged P wave velocity (Vp) reductions in the outermost 50-400 km of the core imply the presence of a stably stratified layer overlying the deeper, separately convecting interior. The precise thickness and nature of the reduced velocity (and density) layer holds critical significance for geodynamo models that address making Earth?s magnetic field, as well as the ability to understand core composition and mineralogy. However, in over ~30 years of seismic studies, no consensus has emerged among seismologists on either the thickness of the layer or the velocity structure within it. This is likely due to the effects of mantle heterogeneity and anisotropy on the seismic data used to probe the uppermost outer core. This project will investigate travel time, wave path, waveform, and shear wave splitting anomalies of seismic waves that travel in the outermost core, including multiple reflections from the underside of the core-mantle boundary (?SmKS? waves), which are more sensitive to outer core structure than any other seismic wave, in order to identify and mitigate the effects of mantle structure on outer core models. To accomplish this, a method that sums seismograms at geographically localized seismic sub-arrays will be used to improve the clarity of weak signals relative to noise, which can improve upon identification of contamination from mantle heterogeneity and anisotropy. 3D wavefield synthetics will be used to benchmark how 1D outer core imaging tools are affected by mantle heterogeneity. New outermost core seismic models will subsequently be determined in forward and inverse experiments based on highest-quality data that have been corrected for the effects of mantle heterogeneity and anisotropy. Thus, this project will thus directly test the longstanding (but likely imperfect) assumption that differential SmKS travel times can be used to reliably retrieve outer core structure without explicitly considering the effects of mantle heterogeneity and anisotropy. In addition to producing new models of outer core structure based on high-quality, corrected data, this project will produce complementary data products that contain new insights into lower mantle velocity heterogeneity and anisotropy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy-efficient and miniaturized THz sources using light-weight, low-cost, and robust materials are a long sought goal. Few materials, however, possess the attributes needed to realize working devices. Metal halide perovskites with reduced dimensionality are a new class of semiconductors with great promise for such applications. They can be inexpensively synthesized and solution processed, have attractive electronic properties, and tolerate defects. These properties have led to great interest for applications in solar cells and flexible displays. Perovskites also show promise as high performance THz sources. Remarkably, these properties can be controlled via spin electronics (spintronics) that exploit the fundamental properties of electrons in devices. This makes it possible to interface perovskites with magnetic materials, enabling spintronic THz emitters. This project will lead to low-cost and energy-efficient THz devices with complementary magnetic, optical and electronic functions. The PIs will educate graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, by integrating research with education. Established and developing outreach programs will be used to involve K-12 students with the project.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>This project focuses on the realization of a spintronic control of the broadband THz emission in RD-HMH/Ferromagnet heterostructures. The research consists of three research thrusts: (1) Demonstrate the proof-of-concept spintronic hybrid THz emitter using reduced dimensional-hybrid metal halide (RD-HMH) polycrystalline thin films prepared by a low-cost spin-coating approach, taking advantage of the fast relaxation of spin (akin to a switch) and efficient spin-to-charge interconversion thanks to the heavy metal elements in RD-HMHs. A thorough, fundamental physical understanding of the ultrafast generation of THz emission in RD-HMH/Ferromagnet heterostructures will be unraveled. (2) Tailor the THz emission via engineering RD-HMH single crystals. Wafer-scale single crystals-based THz emitters will be designed and optimized with tunable bandwidth as well as high quality (Q-) factors, in complement to that of polycrystalline-film emitters. (3) Optimize the THz emission via versatile chemical synthetic routes using device building blocks. The available pool of high-quality synthesized RD-HMH candidates with tunable quantum-well effects are ready to be fabricated into efficient THz emitters, allowing the spintronic and magnetic control of THz generation that can be potentially used for logic applications utilizing THz-wave emission and absorption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While psychologists and education researchers have insights into how perseverance and resilience develop in general, deeply understanding these processes for STEM students and creating practical tools to help students achieve these outcomes will require input from scientists and science faculty. Failure as a part of Learning, A Mindset Education Network (FLAMEnet) brings together a diverse group of researchers and stakeholders to design, implement, and evaluate new approaches to cultivating resilience and challenge-seeking attitudes in undergraduate STEM students. These approaches broadly impact society by contributing to the training of a highly skilled workforce that is prepared to advance science and technology to meet our increasingly complex needs.<br/><br/>FLAMEnet's diversified membership includes psychology and education researchers to ensure that the resources developed are solidly grounded in current theoretical frameworks, and STEM instructors who provide valuable input and secure buy-in from the STEM community. Furthermore, the diversity of the network members inspires the creation of an equally diverse set of resources and intervention strategies that are applicable within and beyond the biological sciences and across institutional contexts. Building on previous RCN-UBE incubator funding (DBI 1827160), we will: 1) Develop resources and instructional materials to aid students in cultivating academic resilience; 2) Support travel for network members during implementation and dissemination of interventions; 3) Expand FLAMEnet membership with annual workshops to share results, develop and refine academic interventions, and promote dissemination of interventions to colleagues at network member institutions.

One category of immunotherapy involves engineering T Cells, key cells in our immune systems, to better recognize cancer cells. As each patient has a unique response to treatment, and success can be improved using a personalized immunotherapy called adoptive cell transfer (ACT) therapy. ACT involves extraction of T Cells from a patient?s own blood, engineering and growing them in large numbers in vitro (outside the body), then reinfusing the engineered T Cells back into the patient. To supply engineered T Cells for ACT therapy, a reliable high-throughput technique is needed to deliver molecules into cells in order to control gene and protein expression. The research goal of this CAREER project is to overcome the limitations of existing delivery techniques by integrating ultrasonic transducers to deliver molecules into cells in a microfluidic system. The proposed intracellular delivery device, called the UXuChip, will improve the molecule delivery efficiency while maintaining T Cell antitumor activity.  Success will help translate immunotherapy from bench to bedside. The primary goal of this project?s education initiative is to integrate the proposed research and educational activities by broadening the education of high school students and the greater community and mentoring at all levels from undergraduate students to post-graduate researchers. The research will be integrated with the development of exciting new educational opportunities on ultrasound imaging, microfluidic chip development, and cancer therapy. Engineering expertise and knowledge will be disseminated to high school students to promote their interest in engineering and biomedical sciences via 10-week research internships.<br/><br/>The investigator's long-term research goal is to utilize engineering principles to develop novel technologies and approaches for cancer diagnosis and therapy.  Towards this goal, the research aim of this CAREER project is to develop the next generation intracellular delivery technique to realize in vitro cell-based therapy to revolutionize therapeutic strategies.   While many immunotherapy treatment plans have shown promising results, a growing number of treated patients experience recurrence and relapse because each patient has a unique response to the same drugs due to cancer heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity.  Failure has been attributed to unwanted genomic and phenotypic alterations, uncontrollable cytokine secretion of engineered T cells, and attacking normal cells by engineered T cells in patients after the intracellular delivery.  To address these unfavorable outcomes, the project will leverage T cell engineering-based immunotherapy by providing a novel intracellular delivery technique with genetic, phenotypic, and functional stability as well as high cell viability and delivery efficiency. The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.  The FIRST Objective is development of an integrated device (UXuChip) using an ultrasonic transducer (UX) and microlens complex and a microfluidic chip (uChip) for cell manipulation. Ultrasound (2 MHz to 200 MHz) generated by a single lithium niobite (LNB) crystal and cylindrically focused by the microlens will push cells to pass through a constriction channel vertically to disrupt the cell plasma membrane to increase permeability for intracellular delivery of macromolecules.  The SECOND Objective is investigation of in vitro cell-level influence of the UXuChip on gene and protein expressions and cytokine secretion, which will be compared with electroporation. Parameters of electroporation and UXuChip will be optimized to achieve cell viability and delivery efficiency over 85% using human / mouse primary T cells. At the same time, CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) will be developed to ablate PD-1, a receptor/checkpoint protein on the surface of T-Cells that limits antitumor activity.  After treatment with electroporation and UXuChip, genome-wide microarray will be performed after 3 and 24 hours. Findings will be used to determine the number of genes that were misexpressed after electroporation and UXuChip treatment and if the effect is prolonged or not. Studies will be designed to test the working hypothesis that the changes in genetic level expression may affect cytokine secretion.  The THIRD Objective is investigation of in vivo effects and assessing the therapeutic potential of engineered T cells by UXuChip by ablating PD-1 using RNPs delivered by UXuChip and electroporation and injecting the engineered T-cells into tumors created in congenic mice.  Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that ablated PD-1 will not be conjugated with PD-L1 on tumor cells, resulting in increased T-cell antitumor activity. The killing potential of T cells treated by UXuChip and electroporation will be compared by monitoring the size of the tumor mass.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

International Data Corporation (IDC) report shows that over 815 million smart home IoT devices were shipped in 2019 and predicts that this number will reach 1.39 billion in 2023. There has been extensive research on IoT and related areas. However, most existing IoT research uses small-scale, ad hoc and non-realistic testbeds or simulation tools to generate data and/or evaluate their work. The U.S. IoT research community lacks high-fidelity experimental facilities to support rigorous and repeatable experimental evaluations of networked IoT systems. The objective of this project is to address the critical issue by developing an integrated IoT infrastructure that provides remotely accessible, configurable, and programmable IoT testbeds. The infrastructure is the first realistic large-scale one, and it includes a smart-home & IoT hardware testbed, a smart heath care testbed, and a smart-office IoT testbed. The testbeds will enable novel and high-quality research in many areas, such as hardware design, IoT, healthcare, elderly care, smart home/office, smart city, etc.  This project will engage a broad community (including academia, industry, and government) in the design, development and management of the infrastructure. The project will integrate research with curriculum development, and broaden participation of computing by including underrepresented students and the K-12 community.<br/> <br/>Shared, remotely accessible, configurable, programmable, and observable IoT testbeds are in great need for researchers at different organizations to experiment and test their work at scale. This project addresses the critical issue by developing an integrated IoT infrastructure. The infrastructure includes three remotely accessible, configurable, and programmable IoT testbeds using one uniform interface: a smart-home & IoT hardware testbed, a smart heath care testbed, and a smart-office IoT testbed. Each testbed consists of several remotely-controllable/programmable robots (to emulate human activities), a large number of smart IoT devices, and an IoT edge server (to store and process IoT data locally. The smart-home & IoT hardware testbed also includes FPGA boards and a high-end mixed-signal oscilloscope, for developing the capabilities to interface with robots and IoT devices, and override their control as needed to further customize their functions. In this project, the team will develop hardware and software (e.g., smart IoT applications (apps), IoT management software, and web interfaces) to grant these off-the-shell IoT devices such remote access features. The proposed infrastructure will enable many new CISE research opportunities, such as remote hardware design and evaluation, configurable IoT hardware test, IoT research based on realistic testbeds and real IoT data, and efficient healthcare and elderly care utilizing smart IoT. With the three IoT testbeds, for the first time the broad research communities (such as hardware design, IoT, healthcare, elderly care, and smart home/office) will be able to generate, access and collect real data, as well as instrument and run experiments using real devices. This project will enable, extend and accelerate high-quality research in the broad areas, and contribute to bringing different communities together. <br/><br/>The proposed infrastructure will enable a number of new CISE research opportunities and support high-fidelity research in healthcare, elderly care, smart home/office, IoT, hardware design, etc. (2) This project will engage a broad community (including academia, industry, and government). (3) The project will integrate the infrastructure development and the supported research into their curriculum development. This proposed project will directly foster new research and educational opportunities at Temple University, and two EPSCoR institutions (University of Arkansas and University of South Carolina). (4) The PIs will engage students of underrepresented groups and the K-12 community into this project. (5) In addition to publications, the PIs will create a publicly-accessible GitHub repository to share the project results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The IEEE FG conferences are the premier international forum for research in image- and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition.  Their broad scope includes new algorithms for computer vision, pattern recognition, and computer graphics, as well as machine learning techniques relevant to face, gesture and body motion for a variety of applications.  The conferences present research that advances the state of the art in these and related areas, leading to new capabilities in interactive systems, biometrics, surveillance, healthcare, and entertainment, and they play an important role in shaping related scientific, academic, and educational programs.  The Doctoral Consortium will provide an opportunity for Ph.D. students whose dissertations are on topics related to automatic face and gesture recognition to present their proposed research, and receive constructive feedback from an invited committee of faculty and industry researchers, as well as from other students working in these areas.  The event will give students valuable exposure to outside perspectives of their work, and provide a comfortable forum in which to discuss and fine-tune their career objectives with members of the international research community, and identify areas that need further development. The workshop will also enable these young researchers to develop a network of contacts at a critical stage of their careers, and will foster a supportive community of scholars and spirit of collaborative research, which will have broad impact because graduate students who are conducting creative and groundbreaking work are the foundation and future of the community.  The organizers will make a particular effort to recruit and include students from underrepresented groups (women and underrepresented minorities) and students from smaller schools or schools with less established computer vision research.  They will also try to recruit a demographically diverse (in terms of region, type of employment and stage in career) group of mentors to advise these students.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Consortium will be a half-day event during the conference.  This year, there will be four distinct aspects to the event.  First, each participant will be paired up with an invited faculty or industrial researcher who works in the related area and will act as their mentor both in the Doctoral Consortium and throughout the FG conference.  Second, there will be a career panel during a working lunch where participants will have an opportunity to discuss their research and career objectives with other participants and mentors in an informal setting.  Third, there will be a dedicated oral session for the students to present their research to the invited committee.  Fourth, there will be a poster session for the students to present their work to all conference attendees.  These four activities, taken together, will afford an excellent and structured way for students to communicate with other students as well as with established researchers of their related research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
