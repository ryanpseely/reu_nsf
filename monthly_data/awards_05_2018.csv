The main goal of this project is to develop feldspar thermoluminescence (TL) for use as an ultra-low-temperature thermochronometer. Once validated, this technique will allow geologists to: infer recent temperature perturbations caused by geomorphic agents acting within the upper kilometer or two of Earth's surface; resolve local Holocene uplift rates and better evaluate seismic risk in tectonically active regions; and survey sites for their potential geothermal energy resources. Dr. Brown will also interact with and train undergraduate and graduate students in the sample preparation and data analysis techniques necessary to implement this novel technique.<br/><br/>The spatial and temporal scales over which rivers and glaciers erode bedrock are largely inaccessible to thermochronologists. Feldspar TL thermochronology, however, shows sensitivity to near-surface and atmospheric temperatures and can be used to constrain continuous thermal histories at timescales ranging from about 100 to 1,000,000 years. This study will calibrate feldspar TL results against results obtained with the more established techniques of paleothermometry from cosmogenic 3He in quartz and apatite 4He/3He thermochronology. Bedrock samples that will be analyzed come from the Yucaipa Ridge tectonic block, adjacent to the San Andreas fault; the Klinaklini glacial valley in British Columbia; and the Pensacola Mountains of Antarctica.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alvarez has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a research and education plan at the University of Oklahoma and Simon Fraser University. The proposed work will make substantial contributions to our capability to numerically understand and predict the physical phenomena that control sediment transport and morphodynamic evolution of river networks. Gains in the knowledge of the role played by macro-turbulence events in sediment dynamics will allow us to obtain a deeper understanding of what determines the geomorphologic changes and will lead to the development of more efficient models.This model can also serve to investigate to what extent information obtained from well-controlled experiments and numerical simulations conducted at laboratory scale can be used to understand the physics of sediment transport at larger scales and to provide predictions about river network changes. The fellow will engage education and outreach by developing a six-week summer course in fluvial modeling, integrating many of the proposed research experiments.<br/><br/>Eddy resolving three-dimensional simulations combined with field and laboratory observations allow elucidation of key elements of fluid dynamics and sediment transport in fluvial environments. These models can resolve the time-dependent, energetically important, turbulent structures of the flow capturing the interactions between these eddies and the loose bed boundaries where sediment entrainment and deposition can occur. This research study proposes a compelling strategy for applying state-of-the-art computational fluid mechanics to the study of sediment transport and morphodynamic processes in fluvial systems. The main objective of the proposed research is the development and testing of a fully three-dimensional turbulence resolving model using Dettached Eddy Simulation techniques that can simulate turbulent flows under a broad range of spatial and temporal scales and their effect on sediment transport, entrainment and deposition and channel/river reach evolution. The numerical model will then be used to (1) understand the role played by the plunging flows, secondary flows and velocity inversions on sediment transport, entrainment and deposition in river reaches and (2) explain morphodynamic changes based on the dynamics of the macro-turbulence effects and velocity redistribution inside the river reach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the individual stones can become airborne during severe storms such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms. Once airborne, the particles can damage buildings downwind and destabilize the roof from which they are removed. The mechanics of exactly how the wind lifts up individual particles is poorly understood, particularly in the complex wind flow around and over a building. This research will combine state-of-the-art, large-scale wind tunnel testing with detailed computational modeling to establish the aerodynamic forces acting on individual particles as they become airborne. The knowledge generated from this research will enable engineers to design building roof systems that are significantly less prone to aggregate blow-off, thus creating safer buildings and surroundings during severe storms.  Learning modules based on the research findings will be developed for undergraduate and graduate fluid mechanics courses. The research also will be used as a platform in Clemson University's EMAG!NE program to engage high school science and math students in outreach activities related to windstorms and other natural hazards. The research team will include a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students working with faculty in South Carolina and Florida.  Data from this project will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org/). <br/><br/>This research will, for the first time, elucidate the physics of loose-laid particle motion initiation in a non-uniform, highly separated turbulent flow. The combination of large- and full-scale wind tunnel experimentation, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) computational modeling, and model validation using physical tests will produce a comprehensive understanding of the mechanics of particle motion initiation.  This project will use the NSF-supported NHERI Wall of Wind facility at Florida International University for experimentation. The experiments and simulations will produce data on the surface shear stress distribution over a roof surface and its correlation with the pressure field.  The research approach of examining particle scale loading and developing physics-based criteria for motion initiation can transform the understanding of other scour problems and mark a significant departure from models that assume uniform flow. This research will move away from empirical approaches to scour that assume shear stress and horizontal aerodynamic drag as the dominant factors for the motion initiation process. By modeling the individual physical processes that, when coupled, result in particle motion, the research can be extended to other erosion problems in unsteady separated flows. The mitigation study on parapets will result in a comprehensive data set on the load changes that result from placing parapets above flat roofs. Combined with the LES modeling, this research will improve the understanding of the role of parapets in building aerodynamics and can lead to safer building designs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at their home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) seeks to advance the research capacity of a biologist by developing a collaboration with a leader in the field of soundscape ecology at Boise State University. The investigator and several minority undergraduate students will work on a research project examining the influence of noise on wildlife. Noise is an important and growing component in both natural and human systems. Anthropogenic sounds, including those from transportation networks, power generation, motorized recreation, urban development, and fossil fuel extraction are loud and pervasive. Remote wilderness areas are not immune and transportation noise is a near universal component of the modern acoustical landscape with noticeable levels of airway, railway, and roadway noise reaching nearly all corners and counties in the continental USA. Meanwhile natural sounds, such as a morning birdsong chorus or the thunder of a mountain river, can be loud and prominent environmental features that are present in virtually all environments. A substantial body of work has revealed that organisms change behaviors and distributions due to noise, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The education and research experiences provided by this project will contribute to WSSU's efforts to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in wildlife biology and also help prepare students for graduate school and the Nation's STEM workforce.<br/><br/><br/>Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain noise avoidance by animals: 1) masking of important auditory information (when the signal and noise acoustically overlap), 2) distraction, a limitation of available processing resources (independent of signal and noise overlap), and 3) noise aversion (associated with a stress response). To tease these hypotheses apart, the researcher and students will conduct a series of lab-based experiments focused on performance and stress in animals foraging in noise. Several species of bats and birds that vary in their reliance on sound for hunting will be pitted against prey in a large flight room. Simultaneously, behavior will be filmed with high-speed cameras and heart-rate, a measure of perception and stress, captured using radio tags. Predators will be trained to locate prey-generated sounds. During the experiments the animals will be observed foraging in quiet control or two noisy soundscape conditions (each with different frequency profiles). If masking is responsible for noise avoidance, then a reduction in foraging success should occur only when the noise overlaps with prey signals. If distraction underlies noise avoidance, foraging deficits will be equal for both noise conditions. However, if aversion explains noise avoidance, a heart rate response will be observed with no decline in foraging success. Understanding the mechanisms driving noise avoidance is critical for the development of sensory ecology theory and anthropogenic noise policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The one-day workshop has been especially beneficial for junior graduate students, giving them a supportive environment in which to present their research (in many cases, for the first time) and enabling them to meet peers and more senior researchers. Networking opportunities have helped senior graduate students and postdoctoral fellows find jobs following graduation.  Indirectly, by retaining women in the field, WiML assists in the development of research products by women. Women continue to be underrepresented in the machine learning community. The ability to meet and interact with other women (role models and colleagues) in a technical environment allows women to build confidence in sharing their work; it is the most often cited benefit of the workshop.  <br/><br/>The workshop achieves these goals via events including the following. (1) Invited talks by established researchers. Technical talks by researchers from academia and industry share core machine learning research as well as serve as role models. (2) Contributed talks and posters by students provide opportunities for graduate students to showcase their own research and raise the presenters' visibility among their peers. (3) Research and career advice roundtable discussions. WiML matches senior researchers with junior researchers in small discussion and mentoring groups. The support from senior women, many of whom were previous attendees, speaks to how WiML is creating a lasting community where women help retain women in the field. WiML is primarily a technical event. Attendees have substantive technical discussions with other attendees, and many attendees go on to stay in contact with colleagues they meet at WiML as research collaborators. WiML has an established pipeline of senior women who continue to return to the workshop each year to encourage and mentor younger researchers.  WiML has also helped with publicity and coordination when other organizations wanted to host events for women, such as lunches at conferences or more local events.  The WiML Board has released a public directory of women in machine learning (with over 1,300 entries) to assist event organizers in finding female speakers and panelists.  Thus, in addition to the workshop, WiML is becoming the de facto source for connecting and finding women in machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this case, it is common to turn to the web, e.g. enter a natural language query, search, browse results, copy-and-paste appropriate code, and modify it to the desired shape. However, this process is still time-consuming. This research aims to automate and enhance this process, by creating new data-driven methods for code synthesis from natural language, which allow developers to go directly from natural language description to code. Specifically, this project's goal is to bring code synthesis to the open domain, moving from highly engineered methods that work on only a single programming language or task, to methods that have the flexibility and scalability to answer most of the questions asked by programmers, in many different programming languages. The intellectual merit of this cross-disciplinary project lies in its potential to contribute to software engineering through the examination of developer's interaction with natural language productivity tools, and its potential to contribute to natural language processing through new models to understand procedural texts. This project will have broader impact through the development of tools and data linking together programs and natural language, potential to improve STEM education by lowering the barriers to programming, and training of graduate and undergraduate research assistants who will be able to straddle and act as bridges between the fields of natural language processing and software engineering.<br/><br/>There are three technical pillars to the work. First, it will focus on methods to mine data consisting of natural language and corresponding code at scale, necessary for training. The mining will be performed over existing online data sources, such as community question answering sites (Stack Overflow) and open-source software repositories (GitHub), using machine learning models that consider both content matches and available meta-data, and crowd-sourcing-based verification of the extracted data. Second, the project will develop code synthesis methods that have the flexibility to handle the wide variety of expressions expected across a variety of software projects and developer needs. This will be done by developing models using neural networks, which have recently shown impressive ability to interpret a wide variety of expressions in other natural language processing tasks. We will expand these models to condition on project context, which will ensure handling of the various constraints necessary to create well-formed programs and allow for adaptation to project-specific conventions and needs. Third, the project will develop methods for learning and improving the models from developer behavior, by feeding back corrections to the generated code into the system and learning from the differences between the pre- and post-correction code. These methods will all be integrated into developer support tools that can be used in a development environment, or through an online API. The utility of these methods will be examined in both controlled and in-the-wild studies. Controlled studies will examine the subjective accuracy of the mined data and generated code, as well as the effect of the tools on the efficiency and ease of development, for programmers from novice to expert level. This project will also create and release tools for general consumption, solicit feedback from a wide variety of developers, and examine how developers use the proposed tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sociological research has documented the importance of social networks for individual health. Social ties may be even more critical for the health of the most vulnerable. Developing a better understanding of the nature and influence of social networks among the underserved will provide insight into social and health disparities, and how the healthcare and social service systems can better partner with network members to improve the health of disadvantaged individuals. The overall goal of this project is to advance scientific knowledge that will strengthen the formal and informal safety net and improve the well-being of individuals in society.<br/><br/>This project will use egocentric social network analysis and qualitative interviews with patients and providers to examine how disadvantaged individuals' networks are shaped by their social and health conditions, and what kinds of formal and informal social interactions facilitate productive engagement with institutions that promote wellbeing. Specifically, network data will be collected from 100 participants and interviews will be conducted with 50 participants to (1) identify the social network characteristics and complex, interacting social and medical vulnerabilities of individuals in the healthcare safety net; (2) examine longitudinal relationships among social network dynamics, health behaviors, services utilization, and chronic disease management to identify social mechanisms that foster or undermine patients' engagement with healthcare institutions; and (3) assess the strengths, functions, and structural positions of formal and informal caregivers to understand the co-evolving roles of institutions and lay persons in patients' networks. Potential contributions of this study include: (a) transforming our conceptual understanding of the formal and informal safety net among the marginalized and the resources provided by social ties, (b) enhancing our research methods for ascertaining and studying personal social networks in these populations, and (c) amplifying our ability to supplement social networks and leverage them to achieve individual and societal benefits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these problems require too long to solve exactly - a common approach for dealing with this has been to design techniques which can efficiently find approximate solutions that are 'good enough' for the task at hand. The study of what approximations are best possible, as well as methods for achieving them, has also led to many new ideas in theoretical computer science, leading to a rich mathematical theory. This project considers several such problems (arising in different areas) which represent challenges to our current understanding. The goal of the project is to develop unified techniques for solving and analyzing them. The project includes several opportunities for training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students. Another aim of the project is to develop a collaborative forum for theoretical computer science students in the Chicago area, which can be used to discuss technical ideas and develop expository material.<br/><br/>This project considers various problems in discrete and continuous optimization, which represent bottlenecks for algorithmic techniques for designing approximation algorithms, as well as for techniques proving hardness of approximation. The difficulty of understanding many of these problems arises from the fact that many of them only impose a relatively weak global constraint on the solutions, which is hard to exploit algorithmically and also not amenable to techniques for proving inapproximability. The project considers several continuous optimization problems which offer an ideal testbed for the development of new algorithmic techniques, while still capturing the bottlenecks in proving inapproximability of related discrete problems. The aim of this project is to examine such problems from the following perspectives: (1) average-case hardness and lower bounds for the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy of convex relaxations; (2) techniques and barriers for proving inapproximability; and (3) conditions under which good approximations are achievable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, in data analysis, a central task is to extract important features of data, a high-dimensional point set in many cases.  The extraction of the significant features then leads to applications such as visualizing the data or clustering the data in a meaningful way.  Another example is in scientific computing where modeling the behavior of a physical phenomenon such as heat, sound or electricity within a geometric space is a central problem.  These problems can be specified by partial differential equations (PDEs), for which efficient solvers are necessary.  Many of these geometric problems can be cast as problems in linear algebra: computational problems on Laplace-de Rham operators, a sequence of matrices that succinctly present geometric spaces.  Thus, faster and simpler methods can be developed for these problems using powerful tools from linear algebra, which is the focus of this project.<br/><br/>Recent advances in the study of graph Laplacians (the first matrix in the Laplace-de Rham sequence) have resulted in a series of simple and elegant algorithms that helped important applications in computer science and data analysis. In contrast, higher dimensional variants of Laplace-de Rham operators, in spite of their key roles in science and engineering (e.g. in solving physical equations, in performing Helmholtz/Hodge decomposition for applications in data visualization and statistical ranking, or in revealing effective  geometric or topological properties of a hidden space) have remained largely under-explored. This project will fill this gap by addressing important open problems about Laplace-de Rham operators for two different types of applications under two high-level aims: (1) design efficient solvers for Laplace-de Rham matrices that appear in important problems raised from partial differential equations (PDEs), e.g. vector Laplacians in Navier-Stokes or Maxwell equations, in scientific computing, and (2) discover and harness effective properties of Laplace-de Rham matrices and their spectra for data analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

He focuses primarily on questions arising in physical applications.  Among the questions he studies are the metastable behavior of fluid systems, whereby long-lived structures like vortices appear in the flow on a relatively short time scale, and then determine the subsequent evolution of the fluid for very long times.  He also studies the influence of localized structures like vortices on the behavior of rotating, stratified fluid layers like the atmosphere.  The differential equations arise in a variety of different physical contexts and are characterized by the fact that while the equations themselves are well known, they are too complicated to solve explicitly except in very special or physically unrealistic cases.  Nevertheless, applications require at least a qualitative understanding of the behavior of their solutions; this research project aims to develop such an understanding.  The project incorporates the training of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows into all facets of this research.<br/><br/>Among the specific systems that the investigator studies are: (i) nearly inviscid fluids and weakly damped Hamiltonian systems like the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam system using normal forms and the theory of hypercoercivity; (ii) invariant manifolds and their implications for the behavior of: (a) unstably stratified, rotating fluid systems, (b) the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and (c) as a means of understanding the continuum approximation of kinetic systems, and (iii) small-divisors in fluid mechanics and other infinite dimensional systems.  One feature that makes it difficult to apply dynamical systems ideas to partial differential equations on unbounded domains is the interplay of effects due to continuous spectrum with those coming from discrete spectrum.  The planned work on stratified fluids and approximation theorems for kinetic systems further develops the theory of invariant manifolds to treat these problems.  The study of small divisor problems in the vortex sheet equations extends KAM-like methods to a new class of infinite dimensional systems.  The study of weakly viscous fluids and weakly damped oscillator systems both leads to a deeper intrinsic understanding of the origin of intermediate time scales in these systems and illuminates the mathematical relationships between these two apparently quite different physical systems.

A bit is ""written"" into the nano-magnet by passing a spin-polarized current whose polarity determines whether bit ""1"" or bit ""0"" is written. The energy barrier between these states prevents the magnetization from switching spontaneously due to thermal noise, making the device non-volatile. Unfortunately, the energy dissipated in the writing current is 100-1000 times more than the energy dissipated in today's CMOS devices, which is a large cost to pay for non-volatility. This project seeks to demonstrate that temporarily reducing the energy barrier between the ""up"" and ""down"" magnetization states with surface acoustic waves (SAW) can significantly lower the current needed to write a bit and reduce the energy dissipation by orders of magnitude.

There are a class of problems called ""NP-hard"" problems which are believed to be computationally infeasible or ""hard"", and without any efficient algorithms. A well-known representative problem in this class is the Travelling Salesperson (TSP) problem: given a large number of cities and pairwise distances among them, what is the minimum length tour that visits all the cities?  NP-hard problems, though computationally hard, do arise in practice and do need to be ""solved"" somehow.  A natural approach is to design efficient algorithms that compute approximate solutions along with a guarantee on the quality of approximation. In the case of TSP, there is an efficient algorithm that computes a tour that is guaranteed to be at most 1% longer than the minimum length tour (which might be good enough in practice).  A huge amount of research has been devoted to designing good approximation algorithms for numerous NP-hard problems. However, it is also of interest to investigate whether there are limitations on the quality of approximation that can be achieved by an efficient algorithm. Indeed, it turns out that for several NP-hard problems, computing an approximation better than a specific threshold is as hard as computing the exact solution (and hence infeasible). These latter kind of results, called ""hardness of approximation"" results, are the focus of this project. The project aims at studying analytic and geometric questions that are motivated by their applications to theoretical computer science (TCS) and primarily to hardness of approximation. The research goals of the proposal will be integrated with teaching, mentoring, and dissemination activities.<br/><br/>Hardness of approximation has been a highly influential topic of research starting with the Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCP) Theorem in early 1990s. While there have been major successes towards characterizing precise approximation thresholds for basic NP-hard problems, this quest remains largely open. The investigator for this project proposed the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) in 2002 to make further progress, which turned out to be quite successful, and led to many novel research directions. This project focuses on (1) the analytic and geometric questions that arise from the investigator's recent work towards proving the UGC; (2) understanding the phenomenon of approximation resistance of predicates (which would certainly lead to challenging analytic questions and would likely be related to the recently resolved Dichotomy Conjecture); (3) analytic questions that are not necessarily related to hardness of approximation, but are among long-term goals in this area at the interface of analysis, geometry, and hardness of approximation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large system may contain a lot of clones that were created from reused software or else from software maintenance where code was modified to fix bugs or adapt to changing requirements. The ability to detect code clones is fundamental to software development, maintenance and evolution. The ability to analyze software retrospectively to find same or similar code is very important to software quality and productivity.  Clone detection has been an active area of research for many years. However, clones were considered same/similar if they had same/similar syntax. This project breaks new ground by detecting semantically similar clones, which may be consider same/similar even if they look different, i.e. have different syntax. To be semantically equivalent, clones need to have the same behaviors, which is to say they produce the same execution paths from the same inputs.<br/><br/>This project investigates dynamic analysis approaches to identifying behavioral similarities among code elements in the same or different programs, particularly for code that behaves similarly during execution but does not look similar so would be difficult or impossible to detect using static analysis (code clones). While code clone technology is fairly mature, tools for detecting behavioral similarities are relatively primitive. The primary objective is to improve and shape behavioral similarity analysis for practical use cases, concentrating on finding similar code in the same or other codebases that might help developers understand, debug, and add features to unfamiliar code they are tasked to work with. The project seeks to advance knowledge about what it means for code to be behaviorally similar, how dynamic analyses can identify behavioral code similarities, how to drive the executions necessary for these analyses, and how to leverage code whose behavior is reported as highly similar to the code at hand to achieve common software engineering tasks that may be ill-suited to representational code similarities (code clones). The research investigates the utility and scalability of dynamic analyses seeking behavioral similarities in corresponding representations of code executions; guiding input case generation techniques to produce test executions useful for comparing/contrasting code behaviors for particular use cases; and filtering and weighting schemes for adapting the preponderance of the evidence metaphor to choosing the most convincing similarities for the software engineering task.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The near future, with complex computer vision systems, self-driving cars, and ML driven medical care and patient monitoring, promises a nearly pervasive presence of ML systems in our society.  Despite promising performance in idealized settings, current ML systems are often brittle--they are sensitive to slight changes in the input data, and often have weaknesses that can be easily exploited by a malicious adversary.  Resolving these current shortcomings is a necessary step in ensuring the stability, safety, and security of a society that relies heavily on machine learning.  The central goal of this project is to develop learning algorithms that are robust, and secure.  These go beyond the traditional goal of developing learning algorithms that achieve high accuracy, and address the broad need for reliability and safety in critical deployed systems.  As an extension of the research component of the project, the investigator will continue education and outreach efforts.  These include disseminating the research publications and code produced by this project, continuing to develop new courses and teaching materials on data-centric algorithms, machine learning, and related topics, and organizing a semi-annual forum for the exchange of ideas between industry and academia.    <br/><br/>The research core of this project addresses the lack of robustness of current learning and optimization algorithms. This lack of robustness takes the following two distinct forms. First, current algorithms are sensitive to changes in even a very small portion of the data-set on which they are trained.  Second, even when trained on legitimate data, the learned models are often susceptible to ""adversarial examples"" in the sense that for the vast majority of data points--even data points in the training set--a small adversarial perturbation of the data point in question will result in the model outputting a completely different label.  The presence of these two types of fragility in current learning systems raises the possibility of vulnerabilities to two new sorts of security threats: 1) the threat that a portion of the training data is either extremely biased and unreliable, or worse--that it has been generated by an adversary whose goal is to mislead the machine learning system, and 2) the threat that deployed machine learning systems can be tricked via minute but carefully generated adversarial modifications in their test points--modifications that are essentially invisible to humans. The project seeks to address these two critical weaknesses of current systems, by : 1) developing new algorithms that are robust to the presence of significant fractions of arbitrary -- including adversarial -- data, which can be applied to a number of fundamental estimation, machine learning, and optimization tasks, and 2) developing a rigorous understanding of why certain training algorithms yield models that are inherently vulnerable to adversarial examples, and develop tools for reducing this vulnerability.  Additionally, this project investigates the computational, and information theoretic aspects of robust and secure learning, including developing an understanding of any potential trade-offs, for example between the amount of training data and computation time, and robustness or security of the resulting trained model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This requires developing appropriate quantum security models and designing new schemes; 3) develop other quantum pseudorandom objects and explore applications beyond computer science such as understanding black holes and thermalization in physics.

Although much progress has been made in software verification and validation, software testing remains by far the most widely used technique for improving software dependability. Among various types of testing, developer testing has been widely recognized as an important and valuable means of improving software dependability. The popularity and benefits of developer testing have been well witnessed in industry; however, manual developer testing is known to be labor intensive, and is often insufficient in comprehensively exercising behavior of the software under test to expose its hidden bugs. To address the issue, one of the common ways is to use testing infrastructures and tools to reduce or complement manual testing effort to achieve higher software dependability. In the past decade, the software testing research community has made significant progress in automatic test generation. With various recent scientific advances by the research community, a question naturally arises: what would be the audacious goal for the field of developer testing in the upcoming decade to bring a much higher testing effectiveness and efficiency to developers? To address this question, this project investigates the science and tools of intelligent developer testing, fundamentally advancing knowledge and understanding in foundations, techniques, and tools for intelligent developer testing. The project improves software dependability by revealing more bugs during software development before they manifest in deployed software.<br/><br/>The project focuses on science and tools for instilling intelligence from two major ways (natural language interfacing and continuous learning) into developer testing tools as part of the efforts for realizing the vision of intelligent software engineering. The project develops novel and practical techniques and tools of intelligent developer testing that have high potential to impact the industry. In particular, the project focuses on parameterized unit tests, which are an improvement over conventional unit tests because they can easily be extended by automated tools to increase code coverage while reusing developer-written oracles. The PI plans to develop intelligent tools that will make it significantly easier for developers to write parameterized unit tests with the goal of automatically translating developer intents into parts of executable test cases.

They constitute some of the earliest forms of life (over three billion years old), and have an aggregate biomass that is larger than that of all animals and plants combined, numbering over 5 x 10^{30}.  Despite their simplicity, the operations and interactions of bacteria are not fully understood, yet microbial communities play a significant role in bioremediation, plant growth promotion, human and animal digestion, disease and drive elemental cycles, the carbon-cycle and the cleaning of water. Thus, it is of significant interest to further understand microbial populations. An interdisciplinary approach toward the understanding of cooperative and anti-cooperative behavior in microbial populations with a focus on signaling methods such as molecular diffusion and electron transfer will be undertaken. The research objective is to investigate biological group behaviors that exploit a variety of coupling mechanisms in order to form structures. In particular, microbial communities that are able to form structures at different scales will be examined. Problems relevant to two key applications motivate the research: microbial fuel cell optimization and infection initiation and suppression and the relationship to quorum sensing. In quorum sensing, when the concentration of a compound produced by the bacteria exceeds a threshold, the bacteria express new genes leading to new community behavior such as luminescing or infection.<br/> <br/>The fruits of the research should result in novel bio-inspired systems that naturally rely on principles of multi-modal sensing and different modalities of control and environmental conditions. More ambitiously, design methods by which structures in microbial communities can be induced are sought. Ongoing collaborations with biophysicists that have been instrumental in model design and validation via experimental data will be leveraged. Given the expertise of key collaborators, two strains of bacteria will be the focus:  Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. In particular: (1) can one optimize the operation of microbial fuel cells exploiting electron transfer in bacterial populations and (2) can one design strategies to understand quorum sensing and potentially prevent infection without the use of antibiotics? Key questions to address include assessing what is the minimal amount information needed in order for distributed entities to form desired structures and geometries as well as engage in desired behaviors. Bacteria have limited capabilities and the distinctions between communication, respiration, and ingestion can often be minimal. These activities can provide either explicit or implicit avenues of communication and thus can exact a control.   Specific problems include: molecular modulation design without the need for timing information, bacterial cable formation via multi-terminal information theoretic methods, models for quorum sensing including decision theoretic approaches, game theory and multicellular interaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory of plate tectonics describes a set of stable, rigid plates (the lithosphere) moving on top of a comparatively soft convecting medium (the asthenosphere). The strength of the lithosphere compared to the asthenosphere determines how the plates interact and is likely responsible for differences in tectonic styles between Earth, Mars, and Venus. However, laboratory measurements of olivine, the most abundant mineral in the oceanic lithosphere, indicate its strength is significantly greater than plate strengths inferred from field observations and numerical simulations of plate tectonics. This stark disagreement inhibits the creation of predictive models for large-scale phenomena like the formation of new plate boundaries, the uplift of Earth's surface after removing ice sheets, and the stress evolution of seismogenic faults after an earthquake. This project will use experiments to investigate three mechanisms that may lead to a weaker lithospheric mantle than predicted by current laboratory data: a length-scale effect (manifesting in terms of grain size), the presence of intracrystalline water, and the role of secondary mantle phases (orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene). The education plan focuses on (1) co-teaching undergraduate tutorials on rock deformation, incorporating modern research techniques into the curriculum, and (2) teaching an earth science course in an outreach summer school aimed at the high school level. <br/><br/>Deformation experiments will be conducted using state-of-the-art interdisciplinary techniques, including nanoindentation and D-DIA to deform plastically natural samples in the laboratory. The PI will establish the plastic behavior of olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene at room temperature while varying the length-scale and water content of the experiments. Deformed samples will be characterized using secondary ion mass spectrometry to measure water concentrations and high-angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction to determine the microstructures related to crystal deformation. Experiments will then be conducted at high temperatures to develop low-temperature plasticity flow laws for the three minerals. Finally, the behavior of multi-phase aggregates will be examined to determine the best method for combining monomineralic flow laws to understand the strength of tectonic plates. The results of this project will provide constitutive constraints that can be incorporated into models of mantle convection, plate flexure, and deformation at the base of the seismogenic zone. Broader impacts include methodology development: setting up NanoSIMS to measure water content in samples as well as HR-EBSD for pyroxeme minerals.

This project aims to close this gap. The project maintains a repository of software tools and benchmarks that is publicly available under open source licenses.

However, a recurring problem in such proofs is that data structure abstractions that work well for sequential software are much harder to reason about in a concurrent setting. The project takes a radically different approach to data structure abstraction that leads to a new semantic model of separation logic and can describe the complex concurrent data structures found in practice. The obtained abstractions admit proof rules that generalize over a wide variety of data structures. This gives rise to novel proof modularization techniques where abstract algorithm templates are proved correct once and for all and can then be refined to concrete data structure implementations, significantly reducing the proof effort compared to the state of the art.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the complexity of the basic question of learning a quantum state (called tomography) was only resolved in the past few years, whereas its classical analogue of distribution estimation is now textbook material in any introductory statistics course.  Research under this award will be dedicated to the study of the problem of estimating fundamental information measures, as well as introduce new information measures for quantum systems. The project will establish the fundamental limits of the information processing capabilities of quantum information systems, as well as design novel algorithms that can match these limits. The project outcomes can enable the development of efficient quantum computer and communication systems.<br/><br/>The award will develop a deeper understanding of a quantum system as a statistical mechanism, and integrate ideas from various disciplines such as representation theory, information theory, statistics, and computer science. A novel variation of the statistical principle of maximum likelihood estimation as a general methodology for quantum property estimation will be proposed and developed. The project will also study the extension of representation theory results of Schur-Weyl duality to higher dimensions to obtain optimal quantum measurement schemes for properties of multiple quantum systems.

The massive MIMO technique is well suited for accommodating a large number of devices and maintaining a constant level of energy efficiency that is independent of the number of devices.

Lattices are mathematical objects defined as the the set of all integer combinations of some n linearly independent vectors in n-dimensional Euclidean space. For instance, the set of all integer points in n-dimensional Euclidean space forms a lattice. For n=2, this is the set of all points in the familiar Cartesian plane with integer coordinates. Lattices have attracted the attention of mathematicians for over two centuries, and have an impressive number of applications in mathematics and computer science, from number theory and Diophantine approximation to complexity theory and cryptography. Lattice-based cryptography is unique in that it is believed to be secure against attacks using quantum computers, a feature not shared by any of the traditional cryptographic schemes such as RSA (named for its inventors' initials).

The first part of the project is to develop a front-end infrastructure that captures these sources of variability in a new intermediate representation. Such reusable infrastructure is crucial to the development of state-of-the-art analyses.  The second part seeks to create variability-aware versions of static analyses and propose new inter-procedural analyses that enable tradeoffs between scalability and precision.

The key to speed and energy efficiency in devices with multicore processors is in finding enough parallelism in computer programs to keep as many of the multiple cores active as possible.  Historically, both computers and people have not been very good at finding enough parallelism for multicore processors.  This leaves many cores idle, making multicore devices slow and inefficient.  This project addresses this problem by helping computers and people extract previously unconsidered parallelism, parallelism that the investigator and others have shown to exist but is hidden because it spans large portions of the whole program.  The project's novelties are new methods and tools to help computers and people extract this previously unconsidered parallelism in programs for multicore processors. The project's impacts are increased performance and energy efficiency for all multicore devices, from smartphones to data centers.<br/><br/>Prior work by the investigator and others demonstrated the applicability and importance of considering the loop critical path in extracting scalable parallelism from loops.  Despite the successes of the loop critical path approach, it misses many opportunities, and its gains seem to have plateaued. The problem is that optimal loop-local decisions often dismiss opportunities revealed by considering the whole program critical path. To realize these opportunities, this project goes beyond loop-level optimization by applying the lessons learned in earlier critical-path-based approaches to entire programs.  This project's aim is a dramatically higher degree of parallelism realized by exploiting concurrency across loop invocations and through non-loop sections of programs.  This project's tasks include analyzing information from dynamic data dependences to expose the whole program critical path, making this information readily accessible to both compilers and programmers, and guiding new compiler transformations to create even more scalable and efficient parallel versions of programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, in many applications starting with Internet-of Things, connections between the nodes are established based on physical proximity or similar features that affect the ability of the nodes to communicate with each other or with the data collector.

Today we have the ability to jointly manipulate these sources of information both physically and computationally, via signal processing, to ever increasing degrees, and the resulting technologies are finding application in diverse domains.  While interference effects would appear to limit the information that can be extracted, this need not be the case, as the familiar example of a pinhole camera illustrates.  Motivated by such examples, this project develops, in a unified way, the role that such phenomena have to play in enhancing the amount of information that can be recovered from environments of interest. Potential applications include medicine, public safety, building security systems, autonomous vehicle safety systems, microscopy and astronomy, and virtual and augmented reality systems. The proposed research is a highly education-centered activity with a focus around the intellectual and professional development of students.<br/><br/>The research investigates several instances and aspects of occlusion-based imaging problems, including: the analysis and optimization of interference phenomena; the development of optimum information extraction and inference of environmental parameters of interest; and investigation of blind methods for poorly characterized settings.  The research emphasizes a common framework of analysis, and exploits a rich collection of tools from signal processing, statistical inference, systems theory, and information theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to reduce the difficulty of developing new software, research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been promoting a new model of programming: instead of having a human engineer design and code algorithms, a set of training examples are used together with machine-learning algorithms to automatically extrapolate software implementations. In classical programing, because such code is written by humans, we can persuade others that it is correct. In machine-learned systems, however, the program amounts to a highly complex mathematical formula for transforming inputs into outputs. The key difficulty, however, is that it is not possible currently to reason about correctness in such systems.<br/><br/>This project addresses this issue by developing an algorithm, called Reluplex, capable of proving properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) or providing counter-examples if the properties fail to hold.  The project has three main objectives. First, the investigators develop algorithmic techniques to greatly reduce the number of states that need to be explored by a verification tool.  Second, they develop a strategy for producing checkable verification proofs.  Checkable correctness proofs make it unnecessary to rely on correctness of the verification tool; one can instead rely only on the correctness of a small trusted proof-checker.  Finally, the investigators implement this approach in an open-source tool and evaluate it on real-world industrial DNNs. Given that AI components are becoming ubiquitous in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, this research will increase trust in these systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditionally, these problems have been tackled using tools from Information Theory (IT), which assumes that the data has been produced according to a certain generative model.  In practice, most of the time the generative model is not known. Even if it is known, it is often more complicated than the models typically used in theoretical studies. This project will use tools from Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT, also known as Kolmogorov complexity), which equates the information in a piece of data with its minimal description length.  The advantage is that the new approach does not rely on any model, and consequently the results obtained this way are valid in more general circumstances. The problems that will be studied are of interest to computer scientists, electrical engineers, and mathematicians. The project will promote a deep and dynamic exchange of ideas between these communities. This project will produce new insights in Kolmogorov complexity and communication complexity. These areas have applications in computational complexity, machine learning, constructive combinatorics, and other fields. The results will likely have an impact in many of these areas. The project will allow undergraduate and graduate students to participate in research activities that have a strong theoretical flavor and the promise of real-world applications.<br/><br/>The project is timely and realistic because it has recently become apparent that some interesting questions (for instance, source coding of non-ergodic sources), which cannot be approached with tools based on Shannon entropy, can be solved in the AIT framework. In the other direction, there has been recent progress in some classical problems in Kolmogorov complexity inspired from results and techniques from IT. The project will: (1) isolate, understand, and develop certain aspects of Kolmogorov complexity that are particularly relevant for data communication; (2) use the newly-developed tools to make progress in outstanding problems in network communication such as channel coding, network coding, interactive protocols, and others; and (3) use the insights from the communication setting to advance the theory of Kolmogorov complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, software transcribes videos, translates documents, selects what news articles are promoted, and determines who gets a loan or gets hired. It is possible for software to exhibit bias in its operation, whether or not it is intended by the customers or developers of the software. For example, software might be more accurate at transcribing male voices than female ones. Or software may inject societal stereotypes into automated translations, and risk-assessment computations may exhibit racial bias. As more societal functions operate in cyberspace, the importance of software fairness increases. In these settings, data-driven software has the ability to shape human behavior: it affects the products we view and purchase, the news articles we read, the social interactions we engage in, and, ultimately, the opinions we form. Biases in data and software risk forming, propagating, and perpetuating biases in society. This project develops theory, techniques and tools to enable software designers and engineers to describe fairness requirements, test the software for fairness properties, and debug fairness defects. The outcomes of this project will help increase the society's trust in software decisions and in the data the software uses, in turn, increasing potential impact and benefits the software can bring to society.<br/><br/>The project addresses scientific questions behind efficiently and effectively measuring potential bias and helping stakeholders make informed decisions about software. It is not the project's aim to devise policies or eliminate bias in software. Instead, the aim is to provide software testing tools and measures that can be validated for formally specified software fairness properties. To measure bias, the project develops a novel approach for measuring causal relationships between program inputs and outputs. Software testing enables conducting causal experiments consisting of running the software with nearly identical inputs that vary only in a key input characteristic under test. Variations in an input characteristic that affect execution behavior provide evidence of a causal relationship. The project identifies when causal relationships are appropriate for measuring potential bias, develops efficient testing methods for measuring these relationships, and creates tools and techniques to help engineers identify and modify the causes of these relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such materials exhibit a range of scientifically interesting and technologically useful properties. Understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for these exotic properties is not only important scientifically, but is an essential prerequisite to optimizing these materials for use in technological applications. This project combines the use of high pressures, high magnetic fields, and visible laser light to identify and control the underlying mechanisms responsible for magnetically responsive behavior in a select group of materials. The diverse techniques employed in this research, including high-pressure techniques using diamond anvil cell technology, high-magnetic-field and low-temperature methods, optical and laser techniques, and materials growth methods, provide the graduate student researchers outstanding training for a diverse range of careers in academia, industry, or national laboratories.  This project is also dedicated to imparting scientific literacy and enthusiasm for science in both the general public and K-12 students, through public lectures on science, middle-school scientific demonstrations, and lab tours that highlight the excitement of the materials studied, and the scientific techniques used in this project.  This project also includes efforts to increase the number and mentoring of underrepresented PhDs in STEM fields; to improve scientific communication skills of PhD students; and to provide guidance to current PhD students concerning their career paths.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>Magnetically frustrated materials, such as the magnetic spinels (chemical formula AB2X4), exhibit a range of diverse ground state phases and phenomena that can be sensitively tuned with pressure and magnetic field, including spin-spiral, charge-ordered, multiferroic, and spin/orbital-liquid phases.  The exceptional tunability of the spinels and other magnetically responsive materials make them excellent scientific laboratories in which myriad phases and phenomena can be sensitively controlled and studied.  Yet, there is limited microscopic understanding of the microscopic magnetostructural effects that lead to the important pressure- and field-tuned behaviors these materials exhibit, due largely to the absence of spectroscopic information that elucidates how the spin- and lattice-dynamics of magnetically frustrated materials change as functions of magnetic field and pressure.  The purpose of this research is to fill this important gap in our understanding by using inelastic light scattering techniques to study the spin- and lattice-excitations of select magnetically frustrated materials while field- and pressure-tuning through their diverse phases.  The goals of this research are to clarify the relationship between competing phases observed in different phase regions, to study as-yet-unexplored phase regimes and phenomena in magnetically frustrated materials as functions of temperature, pressure-, and magnetic-field, and to realize exotic new phases of matter that are of scientific or technological importance. This research also sheds light on the general conditions that are conducive to enhancing magnetoresponsive susceptibilities in magnetically frustrated materials; such information is an essential prerequisite to controlling these materials for useful technological applications.  In addition to providing diverse technical training to several graduate students, this research will impact the broader community through laboratory tours aimed at exposing K 12 students and teachers to the excitement of materials research and optics-related demonstrations to middle schools students; through efforts to improve the numbers and mentoring of underrepresented PhD students; and through scientific communication skills training of PhD students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rioux and Janik of Penn State University are developing fundamental principles to provide new, more effective catalysts. Most catalysts used today consist of aggregates of metal atoms on a support material. The metals are often rare and expensive, and the metal atoms inside the aggregates are not active in catalysis. Much more efficient use of these expensive metals is possible if they are used as single atoms, and not aggregates, on the support. Thus, there is significant motivation for preparing single atom metal catalysts.  The Penn State team is using a combination of experimental and computational methods to determine and understand the conditions under which single atom catalysts can be successfully prepared. Undergraduates from groups underrepresented in science and engineering are being included in these research efforts. In addition, student researchers are developing teaching modules that demonstrate how energy production impacts our environment for inclusion in outreach activities directed at students and the general public.<br/><br/>Single-atom catalysts represent an exciting new class of catalysts that have demonstrated high activity for chemical reactions relevant in energy production.  The research groups of Dr. Robert Rioux and Dr. Michael Janik are developing computationally derived and experimentally validated design rules for the stabilization of single-atom motifs on reducible oxides.  The synthesis approach is based on the strong electrostatic adsorption of precious group metal precursors that will define the upper boundary for metal loading on oxide supports.  The combination of computational and experimental techniques is allowing the determination of descriptors that guide the choice of precursors, support, and pH for the synthesis of stable precious metal single atom catalysts.  Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements of adsorption at the solid-liquid interface and density functional theory calculations are being used to evaluate and predict conditions leading to formation of stable single atom catalysts.  The Pd on ceria system is being used as an initial testbed due to its promise as a low-temperature methane oxidation catalyst.

Molecular recognition---the ability of molecules to recognize and bind specifically to other molecules---is a fundamental aspect of all physicochemical processes, and plays a central role in cellular interactions and biomolecular function.  Among the many examples in nature are the self-assembly of viruses in infected cells preparing to attack other cells; chemical signals directing embryos to form specific organs and limbs; and the mediation of thought and memory in the brain through chemical messenger exchange. In industrial settings, the principles of molecular recognition guide the development of new drugs, advanced materials, catalysts and chemical sensors.  However, quantitative models do not yet reach the level of atomic resolution and reliability necessary for designing molecules that target specific partners.  Molecules recognize other molecules based on static properties such as shape and charge.  However, they are also dynamical entities that perform recognition through the ability of binding partners to change shape and assume complementary conformations.  Dr. Gallicchio is developing advanced techniques and software to target these complex features and capture the influence of molecular motion and flexibility on molecular recognition processes.  The research is being carried out with active participation from Chemistry undergraduate students who, working with partnering experimental laboratories, interactively test computational predictions against measurements. The software and method development efforts involve Physics, Math, and Computer Science students. An important goal of the project is to help students from challenging socio-economic backgrounds to become the next generation of broad-thinking scientists, capable of tackling complex problems from multiple, convergent perspectives.  <br/><br/>The likelihood of interaction between two molecular species is related to the standard free energy of binding, or, equivalently, the equilibrium constant for bimolecular association.  The goal of this project is to develop theoretical models and computational algorithms to accurately and efficiently compute binding free energies from first principles, and to understand how free energies are influenced by molecular properties. A statistical analytic theory of binding relates physical quantities such as the geometry of the binding site, the size of the ligand, and the strength of their interactions, to dynamical data produced from binding free energy simulations.  This theory is being used to improve binding free energy methods through the use of massively-parallel non-equilibrium protocols, and to build an automated classification procedure for molecular complexes based on the parameters estimated from the statistical model.  The code developed for this project is being disseminated as high-performance, automated, freely available, and well-documented software, supporting a variety of platforms and operating systems, including computational grids and heterogeneous high-performance computing systems. The ability to treat dynamical aspects of binding has application to novel chemical synthesis, mitigation of chemical hazards, drug discovery, and materials design.  Research and educational activities are closely integrated within the project and are providing deserving students from challenging socio-economic backgrounds with the scientific and technological skills to enter the modern workforce, while planting the seeds for growing future generations of research scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This empirical approach has failed to induce protection against some pathogens, as vaccine effectiveness can be hindered by a combination of factors including pathogen genetic diversity, complex pathogenesis, and/or ability of pathogens to evade the immune system. Mathematical models in combination with data analysis can help advance the understanding of correlates and mechanisms of protection. This research project provides an interdisciplinary approach into the study of such mechanisms of infection, persistence, and protection. It combines development of mathematical techniques and the use of biological data for the investigation of the role of antibody in the clearance of viral infections, the dynamic mechanisms that induce immunological priming and memory following external challenge, and the complex immune cell interactions following vaccination and boosting. The project aims to help identify key mechanisms involved in the formation of immunological memory after challenge and vaccination with the aim of guiding strategies for disease prevention and control. <br/> <br/>In this project, mathematical models will be developed, analyzed, and compared with temporal data with the aim of (1) evaluating the relationship between protection and the quantity, quality, and dynamics of antibodies following virus challenge; (2) investigating the molecular mechanisms that tilt innate immune cells into inflammatory or tolerant phenotypes; (3) determining the relationship between immunological memory and the size and dynamics of cellular and molecular markers induced through vaccination. The project's investigation of complex non-linear dynamical systems of biological switches is intended to lead to rigorous theoretical criteria on asymptotic, global behavior, as well as model features needed for the emergence of bistable solutions. Model validation against data will provide insight into the relationship between protection and antibody development, and will advance understanding of the relationship between immune factors and vaccination outcomes. Most importantly, it will predict key mechanisms, at cellular and molecular level, involved in the formation of immunological memory following challenge.

As the world's population expands to the expected 9 billion by 2050, there will be a need to balance difference resources across these three systems to obtain different user goals without putting undue strain on the ecosystems that provide these resources. The goal of this project is to develop FEW Nexus solutions for regions where bioenergy crop production competes with animal feed production for land, water, and energy sources. Due to the increased demand for ethanol from corn production, there is less land for animal feed production. Farmers will often use distiller's dried grains with other grain waste products to supplement animal diets. However, this feed is not digested efficiently by swine and poultry, leading to wasted nutrients and nutrient run-off to surface waters. The Hu research group at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, in collaboration with Chinese partners at the Dalian University of Technology, Guangxi University, Beijing Technology and Business University, and Beijing Normal University, propose to develop a fungal fermentation step during corn-ethanol processing to convert corn stillage, along with other agricultural residues, to animal feed that can be better utilized by swine and poultry. This step will ultimately reduce energy costs for the corn-ethanol production process and mitigate impacts to the interconnected FEW systems of bioenergy production and animal feed production. By testing various agricultural residues, the researchers will identify different opportunities for nutrient enhancement for swine and poultry feed which will lead to more efficient digestion by these animals and reduce nutrient run-off from incompletely digested feed.<br/><br/>Through the whole conversion of corn and selected agricultural residues, the principal investigator's research group, in collaboration with 4 Chinese universities, will support both the biofuel and feed production industries in interconnected food-energy-water (FEW) systems. Livestock with monogastric diets are typically fed with corn stillage, a by-product of the corn-ethanol fermentation process to reduce the cost of ethanol production. While suitable as feed for monogastric livestock, this stillage is not easy to digest. The inefficiency of stillage digestion leads lower nutrient uptake by livestock and, subsequently, the increase of nutrient run-off from animal waste.  The researchers plan to study methods to improve the digestibility of this feed through fungal fermentation of this stillage, along with other residues such as rapeseed meal, during integration with corn ethanol production. First, they will evaluate the digestion efficiency of these co-products in comparison to traditional diets of corn-soybean meal and untreated corn-stillage diets to determine the best combinations of stillage and residues. Once the optimized feed mixture(s) is/are identified, life cycle analyses and techno-economic analyses will be used to identify the potential economic and environmental impacts of the new diets from synthesis to digestion and waste treatment.  The research could benefit bioenergy production in both the US and China by lowering the cost and the environmental impact of corn ethanol production through the development of a higher-value byproduct of corn ethanol fermentation.  The researchers plan to engage the Hmong community, an underrepresented Asian community, through community outreach, high school programs, and summer camps designed to inform these stakeholders of ways to increase their corn ethanol production income while benefiting the environment and reducing strain on the local FEW Nexus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although akin to the familiar test-tube, these chemical reactors are exceedingly small.  Much like Nature's catalysts - enzymes - these reactors are capable of trapping one molecule at a time to bring about novel and selective chemical transformations.  Additionally, the program of research is designed to improve our understanding of chemical transformations using exceedingly mild conditions (e.g., room temperature water).  This research is important to society because it addresses national needs in sustainability.  The use of room temperature water helps to reduce energy cost for production of chemicals and avoid environmental issues associated with the use of organic solvents.  Broader impacts of the research include education and training of graduate and undergraduate students as the next generation of productive members and leaders in the chemical sciences, as well as outreach activities designed to promote chemistry within the local community and to broaden participation in science and engineering fields.<br/><br/>The state-of-the-art of supramolecular chemistry has now reached a point that the construction of (supra)molecular containers is relatively facile.  Building on this, a significant aim of this program of research is to consider how electrostatic potential fields within nano-spaces can be engineered, and in doing so, how it is possible to control guest reactivity and catalysis within the nano-space.  This program of research focuses on three classes of chemical conversions (cyclization reactions, stereoselective halogenation of carbon-carbon double bonds, and halogenation of aromatic compounds) using cavitands and deep-cavity cavitands as scaffolds and hosts.  All of the chemical conversions being studied utilize water as the solvent and take advantage of the hydrophobic effect to drive guest complexation and/or promote turnover.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be accomplished through the twin tools of fundamental particle-physics theory, along with cosmological observations, which include galaxy clustering, the hot and cold spots in the microwave background, and the bending of light by galaxies (gravitational lensing), to improve our knowledge of the mechanism responsible for the current period of acceleration. The project will focus on providing a further stress test of the data to search for any evidence of alternative theoretical explanations for the cosmic acceleration, including modifications of the General Theory of Relativity. Important to the success of this program is an outreach component, which will be coordinated with the SUPA program at Syracuse University. The outreach will include communicating our results to local high school students and more broadly to improving the science curriculum throughout the state of NY and beyond.<br/><br/>The quality of data from cosmological probes of Dark Energy (DE) continues to grow at an impressive rate, whereas theoretical progress in our understanding of the underlying mechanism behind cosmic acceleration has been far more modest. As the accuracy of cosmological measurements continues to improve it is crucial to establish an economic and systematic way in which to use data to guide theoretical efforts to reveal the nature of DE.  The Effective Field Theory (EFT) of DE provides such an approach. By focusing on the fundamental symmetries of different DE models, rather than the details of a particular model realization, the EFT groups DE models into universal classes based on their general properties. This approach is analogous to the use of EFT methods in particle physics and condensed matter, where it has been very successful in connecting theory and experiment.   This project will focus on developing the EFT of DE to establish whether the EFT framework is robust enough to provide a uniform approach to the study of DE.  On the practical side, the investigators will work to establish a parameterization of the EFT that is best suited for bridging the gap between fundamental theory and cosmological observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the colors of light emitted by these nanoparticles can be altered simply by changing the size. This type of size-tunability is exploited in many modern electronic devices, such as high-resolution displays and biomedical sensors. Other properties can also change with particle size.  For example, the melting point of nanoparticles tend to decrease as their size is reduced, which presents problems for applications that involve significant heating during manufacturing. In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Richard Schaller at Northwestern University is studying the melting of nanoparticles after the sudden introduction of energy.  Working with his students, Professor Schaller uses very short pulses of laser light to rapidly heat nanoparticles, causing them to expand and melt. The team then employs a series of ultrafast experimental methods to monitor structural changes in the nanoparticle lattice. The insights gained from the research could impact technologies ranging from light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) to solar cells. These insights may help to advance additive manufacturing in 3D printing, which could benefit from facile melting and growth of particles into larger solids. The project also provides education and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.  The results from the research are incorporated into chemistry courses at Northwestern University.  Professor Schaller and his students interact with the City Colleges of Chicago, STEMfest events, and K-8th grade students in<br/>Evanston's District 65, to spread interest in the sciences through on-site classroom demonstrations and guest lectures.<br/> <br/>This research experimentally probes equilibrium- and transient- physicochemical effects that underlie properties of nanoparticles at elevated temperature as well as in elevated temperature processing. The activities focus on advancing the fundamental understanding of both nanoparticle and surface chemistries, so as to develop strategies that can enable individual nanoparticles to maintain their desired function at elevated temperature (preventing the loss of ligands, change of crystal phases, or evolution of chemical composition).  The effort implements transient physical and spectroscopic methods including high fidelity, synchrotron-based transient x-ray diffraction to probe heating and phase behavior, and vibrational spectroscopies.  The research enables insight into ligand behavior and local chemistry, in these important, yet poorly explored conditions.

Mathematicians have divided the study of spaces into two parts: qualitative questions (like whether a space has a hole in it), which is the field of topology, and quantitative questions (like the diameter of the hole), which is the field of geometry. Most, though not all, applications require quantitative answers, but before one can start on quantitative answers---the geometry---one needs to understand the qualitative behavior---low-dimensional topology, the focus of this National Science Foundation funded project. Indeed, in four-dimensions, even many of the most basic topological questions remain unanswered---questions about how many different simple spaces there are, how spaces can be cut up into simpler pieces, and what kinds of surfaces one can fit in given four-dimensional spaces. By using relations with other parts of mathematics and high-energy physics, this proposal seeks to advance human understanding by developing tools to answer some of these basic questions.<br/> <br/>This project, which focuses on applications of symplectic topology, algebraic topology, and representation theory to low-dimensional topology, has four interrelated goals. The first goal is to extend Lipshitz-Ozsvth-Thurston's ""bordered Heegaard Floer homology"" invariant of three-manifolds with boundary from the ""hat"" variant to the richer ""minus"" variant, for three-manifolds with torus boundary. The second goal is to prove a higher naturality result for Heegaard Floer homology, giving a functor from an appropriate quasi-category of decorated cobordisms to the quasi-category of chain complexes. The third goal is to prove new localization results relating the Heegaard Floer homology of a space with the Heegaard Floer homology of its branched covers. The fourth is to extend Lipshitz-Sarkar's stable homotopy refinement of Khovanov homology to cobordisms between knots and to other variants of Khovanov homology, including Lee homology.

Among these, thin film organic photovoltaic cells (based on small organic molecules and polymers) are a potentially suitable option. This technology provides a path towards a lightweight, flexible platform for integration of renewable electricity production capacity into building infrastructure. Of the organic solar cells under study, ternary blend cells have demonstrated the potential for state-of-the-art efficiency. In addition, the technology amends itself to simple device fabrication methods that are compatible with existing continuous roll-to-roll processing manufacturing methods. This project will address fundamental research into the mechanisms that govern the active layer of material, the polymer blend, in order to increase efficiency of the resulting device. The project will focus on the complex physical and electronic interactions in the ternary polymer blend mixture that determines the cell's solar conversion efficiency. The research plan of the project is coupled with a cohesive educational plan that benefits community college students as well as University of Southern California (USC) undergraduates and graduate students. Community college students from Cerritos College (Norwalk, CA) will be hosted each summer to participate in the research project. These students are largely from under-represented groups in STEM and many are first generation college students. The project also involves collaborations with laboratories in Germany and Denmark. Undergraduate and graduate students (from Cerritos and USC) will also work closely with the international collaborators, including graduate student exchange for an extended international research experience. Finally, the project includes efforts toward developing write-to-learn pedagogies are being pursued in undergraduate organic chemistry courses at USC with the goal of facilitating learning and student retention. <br/><br/>The focus of the fundamental research project is to expand the understanding of the role of miscibility of synergistic components in ternary blend organic solar cells, specifically those based on two donor polymers and one molecular acceptor. Specific interests are centered on how physical relationships influence the open circuit voltage and on the development of a more global picture of favorable electronic interactions between components. The objectives of the project are: to elucidate the fundamental physical and electronic interactions between synergistic components and clarify the mechanism of operation; to establish the limits of effective electronic relationships between synergistic donor components, specifically focusing on the maximum effective highest occupied molecular orbital offset; and to develop rational design rules for synergistic components. This work will be executed through a combination of polymer synthesis, basic electronic and structural characterization, device characterization and theory.

Mendelian Randomization (MR) is one popular approach to draw better causal conclusions from observational data.  In a nutshell, MR is a ""big data"" approach based on methods from economics. Specifically, MR adapts instrumental variables (IV) to large observational genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to determine causal mechanisms. Specialized MR methods and computer software have been developed leading to the widespread use of the approach, but to date little is understood about the statistical properties of these methods. For example, when do MR methods work well (and when do they not)? Other fundamental questions about the underlying causal mechanisms are also poorly understood.  This project will investigate the statistical theory and methods behind MR so that investigators can properly use MR to draw causal conclusions from observational data, leading to better medical and health decisions.<br/><br/>The MR approach requires finding genetic variants in GWAS, called instruments, that satisfy the following assumptions: (A1) Instruments are associated with the risk factor, (A2) Instruments have no direct effect on the outcome, and (A3) Instruments are unconfounded by variables affecting both the outcome and the risk factor.  Specific aims that will be investigated include (1) laying the theoretical foundations for MR including identification and statistical sufficiency, (2) studying the statistical properties, including efficiency, power, and robustness, of popular MR methods, such as the median method or the MR-Egger method, (3) proposing new MR methods that are robust to common problems associated with MR data, most notably violations of the three core assumptions (A1)-(A3), (4) developing numerical and visual diagnostic tools for assumptions underlying MR, and (5) producing easy-to-use software suites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will highlight where and how fast deltas are expected to be drowned by sea-level rise, eroded by waves into spits and barrier islands, or shaped by tides into alluvial estuaries. Such a unified, global picture can also be used to assess how uncertain future scenarios, driven by for example carbon emissions, will affect coastal change. To achieve broader impacts the investigators will collaborate with Deltares and the United Nations to reach decision makers on a local and global scale by developing the Delta Forecast tool, a new interactive web-based map that will highlight projected changes to river deltas.

This ""polar amplification"" is consistent with the dramatic temperature increase seen in the Arctic, which has caused a variety of severe impacts on the human and natural systems of the region. Research on polar amplification is thus of practical as well as scientific interest, as the warming and thawing of the polar regions is poorly understood and difficult to predict yet has worldwide consequences.<br/><br/>In the education and outreach component of this CAREER award the PI works with undergraduate students to develop computer games that can be used to introduce middle school students to environmental science. The work is based on research showing that appropriately designed games can be used to introduce students to scientific discovery, enticing them to probe a virtual world through formulating, testing, and reevaluating hypotheses. Games have been developed to foster scientific thinking in other disciplines including molecular biology and astrobiology. The work has educational broader impacts both for the broad audience of game players, many of whom may have limited interest in traditional STEM classwork, and for the cross-disciplinary team of undergraduate students who develop the game.<br/><br/>The scientific focus of the project is the lapse rate feedback, in which changes in the way temperature varies with height affect the total amount of warming that occurs for a given increase in carbon dioxide (CO2).  In the tropics the warming is top heavy, with greater temperature increases at upper levels, and the greater warming aloft helps the atmosphere cool to space more effectively to balance the heat trapping effect of the CO2.  But the polar caps typically warm more near the surface, in part due to reductions in ice and snow cover which expose the darker land and sea surface below. This bottom heavy warming requires a greater temperature increase to balance the CO2 increase than would be required if the warming were distributed equally at all levels, thus it contributes to polar amplification.<br/><br/>The logic of the polar lapse rate feedback is sound and the effect has been demonstrated in models, but the strength of the feedback is unclear.  One consideration is that energy transport into the polar caps could work against bottom-heaviness given that much of the transport occurs aloft. But the net effect of energy transport is unclear as the transport of dry static energy is expected to decrease with warming while latent energy increases as the air becomes more moist. Low cloud changes due to near-surface warming may also reduce the warming effect of the polar lapse rate feedback.  These effects are examined through simulations using a hierarchy of models at varying levels of complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the non-constructive nature of its proof has been a barrier towards finding these structures efficiently. Existential proofs based on the algebraic method have resisted progress on the constructive front (unlike those based on probabilistic method). In this project, the investigators will break ground along this direction by obtaining efficient constructive proofs for restricted applications of Combinatorial Nullstellensatz.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current ways of providing communication and information access to DHH museum visitors require DHH learners to split their attention between the visual focus of the experience and the interpreter or captioning display. As a result, DHH learners are forced to decide which information to miss during live presentations, thus presentations may not be fully comprehended by the DHH learner. Furthermore, this issue perpetuates a lack of inclusivity and accessibility in informal STEM learning environments. The work focuses on investigating approaches to develop an AR platform with a near-eye display that will allow DHH visitors to receive signed or captioned instruction while still looking at and interacting with the intended exhibits. The new platform will allow for transmission of live and spontaneous instruction. Researchers will evaluate and recommend efficient ways to make information at science centers and museums accessible to the DHH population based on data collected from DHH learners. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program's Pilot and Feasibility Studies which seek new approaches to design and development of STEM learning to be accessible to all learners including underrepresented groups in informal environments.<br/><br/>The researchers will investigate the following research question: how can the use of Augmented Reality (AR) as a method of support service delivery improve the engagement of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) adolescent learners in semi-structured learning environments? Both formative and summative evaluations will be conducted from two different angles: (1) an engineering-centric evaluation focused on technical development and (2) an educational-research centric evaluation focused on pilot studies on user experiences, attitudes, and learning outcomes. Both qualitative and quantitative data on the use of this technology will be collected. The evaluation methods include attitudinal surveys (pre/post), ethnographic observations, pre/post tests of content knowledge, and semi-structured group and individual interviews. This project will be conducted by researchers in the Center on Access Technology at National Technical Institute for the Deaf, one of the colleges of Rochester Institute of Technology, in partnership with the Rochester Museum & Science Center, which includes the Rochester Challenger Learning Center.

Water trapped between the plates is thought to play an important role in controlling friction along the plate boundary and may explain large variations in earthquake activity along the Alaska Peninsula. This study will collect seafloor electromagnetic geophysical data to image the distribution of water in the sediments and crust along the plate boundary, with the goal of understanding how the transport and release of water in this critical region may regulate earthquake behavior and plate slip. This project will advance electromagnetic imaging as a new tool for studying subduction zones, and one that will help to image fluid volumes in key areas of the megathrust fault. The project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students at sea where they will learn how to collect and analyze marine electromagnetic data.<br/><br/>This project will use new marine electromagnetic (EM) imaging technology to study the fluid content of the crust and mantle along the Semidi and Shumagin sections of the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone. These sections of the subduction system have markedly different seafloor fabric entering the subduction zone trench and commensurately different seismicity. Data from a 2011 active seismic survey at this location show variations in sediment thickness and crustal fracturing along the incoming plate but are not able to fully constrain the amount and distribution of fluid. Passive and active EM data will be collected during a month-long cruise at 160 ocean-bottom stations along three trench-crossing profiles and one along-strike profile. Controlled-source EM data will image the electrical conductivity of the sediments and crust, while passive magnetotelluric data will map deep crustal and upper mantle conductivity. Together these data will constrain the hydration state of the incoming plate at the trench outer-rise, the distribution of fluids along the plate-interface beneath the forearc, and the release of fluids into the overlying forearc crust. The new EM data will be interpreted in conjunction with the existing seismic survey results to: (1) test the hypothesis that along strike variations in seismicity and plate locking are related to the fluid content of the incoming oceanic plate, which in turn is related to the pre-existing fabric in the plate and the orientation of this fabric with respect to the trench; (2) image and quantify fluids released from sediment dehydration along the surface of the down-going plate; (3) image and quantify zones of over-pressurized fluids and hydrofacturing of the overriding plate related to fluid release from the slab; (4) compare the conductivity structure at the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone with a similar profile at the Middle America Trench, an end-member system where seafloor faults are aligned parallel to the trench, potentially maximizing fluid-flux into the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching aim of these topics is to push forward our knowledge in mathematics as well as in physics. In particular, this involves geometric analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with a focus on the Einstein equations in general relativity. The new insights and methods from this project will also be important to solve other structurally similar PDE, some of which are central to models in science and technology. One main branch of the PI's research concerns the Einstein equations linking the physical content of our universe to geometry, thus they give the physical laws a geometric structure. These equations are at the heart of the theory of general relativity, which governs the physics of our universe in the large. Exploring these equations will lead toa better understanding of the universe as a whole and of isolated systems such as galaxies, binary black holes or binary neutron stars.  The observation of gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) project in 2015 marked the beginning of a new era where information from distant regions of our universe is decoded directly from the universe itself (rather than from electromagnetic waves like for instance light in telescopes). More than ever, synergies between mathematics, in particular analysis of PDE and geometry, physics and astrophysics are needed to unravel the new structures. The PI will build on her results to develop new methods to achieve these goals. Through the educational component of this project, the PI's research will also have direct impact in a wider sense via teaching and outreach activities.The PI will train students and postdocs in these fields, and through broad outreach activities reach members of the public including underrepresented groups. The PI will also communicate her results through publications, conferences and the internet.<br/><br/>The PI will develop and explore new mathematical methods to investigate the Einstein equations and other nonlinear PDE describing physical phenomena. In particular, the PI proposes to study: (1) the Cauchy problem for the Einstein equations focussing on spacetimes with radiation; (2) the mathematics of gravitational waves and their memory effect (a permanent change of the spacetime showing as a permanent displacement of test masses in a detector like aLIGO) in general relativity,as well as analogs of memory in other physical theories; and (3) Euler equations and other PDE per se and their coupling to the Einstein equations. Whereas all these topics center around a purely mathematical (geometric-analytic) treatment, each one of them will produce results that can be directly applied in physics experiments. Parts of the suggested research will continue the PI's former work linking her mathematical insights to experiments (aLIGO in particular). It is expected that the gravitational wave memory effect will be measured in the near future. These new projects will partially build on the PI's and collaborators' recent results and methods but will also require new ideas and approaches. The PI and D. Garfinkle derived two analogs of memory in electromagnetism, thus for the first time outside of general relativity. The PI and collaborators will continue their research to complete the understanding of memory in general relativity, and to extend their research to other physical theories (e.g., quantum electrodynamics). The PI will connect this line of research with her other project about the global Cauchy problem, and she will study other PDE with geometric-analytic methods. Moreover, solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to other PDE will be investigated for general situations, including asymptotically flat as well as cosmological spacetimes, and thereby interesting local and global structures are expected to be found.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, work of Riemann on curved spaces later provided the mathematical language necessary for Einstein's theory of general relativity, which explains gravity in terms of curved spacetime. The broad framework, in which gravity is a paramount example, is known as field theory. Other key examples include the gauge field theories governing the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, which required physicists to use (and develop for themselves) non-trivial mathematical ideas from geometry, topology, and modern algebra. In fact, a systematic and rigorous mathematical framework that fully integrates these insights of physics is currently not available. This project aims to improve the situation by placing these field-theoretic ideas and techniques into the emerging subject of derived differential geometry, in particular, by developing a novel approach to derived differential geometry tailored with this application in mind. The Principal Investigators hope this effort will lead to a new language which facilitates communication between mathematicians and physicists.  They will explore the wealth of derived geometric objects that theoretical physics offers, focusing on connections with gauge theories.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators will develop foundations for derived differential geometry (DDG) custom-tailored for field theory and will work out concrete applications of this framework. On one hand, their approach will be similar to that of Toen-Vezzosi for derived algebraic geometry, allowing one to easily adapt their theory, tools, and techniques, specifically the theory of shifted symplectic and Poisson structures. On the other hand, with D. Roytenberg and R. Grady, they will incorporate a locally ringed approach to DDG, rooted in dg-manifolds and thus making it easy to import examples from physics. As a continual test and guide for developing our framework, they will carefully construct and investigate the derived critical locus of the Chern-Simons action functional, which can be thought of as a derived enhancement of the character varieties of 3-manifolds. With P. Teichner, the PIs will use this derived stack to relate quantum groups to the perturbative quantization of Chern-Simons theory. Finally, with R. Grady and B. Williams, the PIs will pursue a higher categorical analogue of work by Gelfand-Fuks-Kazhdan, Bott-Segal, and Haefliger, providing a natural home for invariants of smooth manifolds equipped with local structures, such as foliations, as well as for the anomalies to quantizing nonlinear sigma-models.

However, due to their limited computational resources, most existing approaches either use memoryless approaches, such as reactive obstacle avoidance, or highly memory-inefficient approaches that build and store accurate geometric representations.  An important question, therefore, is what is the minimal representation a robot must create of its environment in order to achieve its task.  A related question is what are the fundamental tradeoffs between how memory-efficient the representation is and how efficiently the robot can accomplish the task.  An understanding of these issues has the potential to dramatically increase the type of tasks that MAVs can perform.<br/> <br/>Motivated by the need for memory-efficient algorithms, this project is developing principled and general techniques for establishing the memory resources required by robots in order to perform their tasks. Specifically, the project will investigate: (i) techniques for establishing lower bounds on memory requirements, and (ii) algorithms for creating memory-efficient and task-centric representations for robot tasks. The key insight is to leverage and extend ideas from the theory of streaming algorithms and communication complexity, establishing a connection between streaming problems and robot perception by viewing a robot's sensory inputs as constituting the data stream.  This analogy enables application of powerful techniques, originally developed by the theoretical computer science community, for proving lower bounds on memory requirements and using the vast suite of memory-efficient algorithms from the streaming algorithms literature. The resulting tools will be applied to MAVs with limited computation performing various tasks such as search, exploration, and navigation in search-and-rescue contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The methods are based on mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for characterizing the compositions and structures.  They allow accurate and sensitive analysis of the molecular structures of the synthetic macromolecular compounds comprising these materials, enabling meaningful understanding of the relationships between molecular structure and useful properties, thus facilitating the design of better, commercially viable products with desired macroscopic features.

More specifically, these equations govern mathematically-defined processes that smoothly modify objects in a way that is driven by geometrically meaningful quantities such as length, area, volume or curvature.  The equations that the PI studies have very nice regularity properties, in the sense that bumpy objects often become smoother as they evolve; in fact, it is reasonable to expect that the object will gain more symmetries as the flow proceeds, and this will help us better understand the class of geometric objects we started with.  Unfortunately, these equations also have the potential to develop singularities in finite time, meaning that the solution may acquire sharp points and corners, and one cannot expect in general to have a smooth solution to the equation for a long time. In order for us to achieve our ultimate goal, and better understand the underlying geometric object using the flow techniques, we need to understand how to deal with singularities that may arise. These and similar topics have been the subject of several workshops in geometric analysis at Rutgers University organized by the PI (together with colleagues), attracting many graduate students and featuring both research talks and advanced graduate-course level lectures.<br/><br/>One of the aims of this project is the classification of ancient solutions to nonlinear geometric flows, such as, the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. The PI proposes to combine the PDE techniques and geometric estimates to study the ancient solutions of such flows. Their classification is crucial for better understanding the singularities that occur in finite time. Ancient solutions to the two-dimensional Ricci flow describe trajectories of the renormalization group equations of certain asymptotically free local quantum field theories in the ultraviolet regime. The PI will classify ancient closed non-collapsed solutions to the three-dimensional Ricci flow, which would settle down a conjecture stated by Perelman in one of his papers. The PI shall also find minimal conditions that guarantee smooth existence of a solution to the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. The PI also wants to understand singularity formation in the following sense: what the stable singularity models in four dimensional Ricci flow are. This is related to understanding the singularity formation of a four-dimensional Ricci flow starting at generic initial data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key goal of the research is to investigate the relationship of groundwater age and sustainability. The two have often been conflated, but there has yet to be a mechanistic study linking the distributions of groundwater age encountered in a pumping well with the sustainability of extracting water from that well. This work will bring together stakeholders in Tucson such as water managers, native communities, urban residents, and industry representatives to establish mutually agreed upon parameters for groundwater sustainability, such as acceptable spatial and temporal scale of overdraft. The results of this stakeholder engagement will be explored using a combination of age tracers for residence time estimation and integrated hydrologic modeling. The study is important in linking groundwater age to sustainability using advanced modeling and age-dating techniques, as well as to advance national health and welfare, since access to clean water is paramount for the prosperity of communities in semi-arid and arid regions of the United States. <br/><br/>Multiple age tracers will be linked with a sophisticated integrated hydrologic model to explore the full spatial and temporal scales of flow path and storage response to groundwater extraction, using the Tucson regional aquifer system as a case study. Extraction wells will be sampled for common age-dating tracers (Tritium-Helium and Carbon-13) to estimate the fraction of young and old water encountered in Tucson extraction wells, respectively, using a novel tracer (Argon-39) to estimate the intermediate age fraction. The integration of these three tracers will reveal a more complete distribution of flow paths contributing to a well, and thus provide insight as to the recharge and hydrogeologic characteristics of the regional aquifer system. These results will be used to validate an integrated hydrologic model (ParFlow-CLM) of the Tucson area via a particle tracking code (EcoSLIM). This step will result in a model that captures the dominant flow systems contributing to Tucson extraction wells. The posterior model will then be used to explore the relationship between groundwater age and sustainability, and project this relationship forward under climate change and population growth scenarios.  This result will fill in the gaps in our understanding of flow path distributions to wells using non-overlapping age tracers and link those results to a sophisticated regional aquifer model that includes the upland recharge and contributing areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The basic principles of how T cells efficiently discriminate between rare foreign cells and abundant host cells is not completely understood. This project will develop a new generation of theoretical and computational tools to massively accelerate the random sampling of T cell activation times. Working with experimental collaborators, the project will explore (through mathematical modeling, stochastic analysis and large scale computational simulations) the role that the cell-to-cell contact topography plays in immune recognition. This award will support undergraduate and graduate student researchers to work on this project. This project will reach the broader mathematical community through mini-symposia at upcoming conferences and thematic workshops hosted by the American Mathematical Society.<br/><br/>When T cells encounter a cell of interest, they scan its surface for rare diffusing signaling molecules. This search is conducted in a bustling and noisy environment and so T cell activation is a stochastic process described mathematically as a first passage problem. Previous mathematical models of this process assumed the interface between the cells was large and contiguous. Recent experimental work has revealed that T cells extend numerous finger-like projections called microvilli to sculpt a highly transient and distributed interface. This project will build new models of T cell activation that incorporate the recently discovered role of stochastic topography arising from microvilli sampling. Much existing first passage theory has focused on determination of the mean of the distribution. Owing to the sensitivity of T cell activation, this project will require the development of new probabilistic tools to obtain the full distribution of passage times in a variety of narrow escape problems. To complement these theoretical results, the proposal will develop a new suite of computational (deterministic and Monte-Carlo) tools for studying stochastic processes in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The science and engineering generated by the study will promote the production of chemicals from renewable feedstocks, thereby decreasing dependence on fossil resources, reducing global carbon footprint, stimulating and diversifying rural economies, and promoting a range of educational opportunities. <br/> <br/>Metal-support interactions provide a suitable handle to engineer the catalytic activity of a chosen metal function through both chemical and electronic effects. Such interactions have been generally overlooked in the case of carbon as this material is usually considered to be inert in catalysis. Yet, there is ample evidence in materials science that the electronic properties of carbons can be tailored by varying the nature and concentration of the oxygen moieties that cover their surface. As a result, the work function of conventional carbon scaffolds can be modulated between 4.4 and 5.4 eV, providing an ideal platform for studying and harnessing electronic metal-support interactions without the challenges associated with atom mobility that are common for oxides. The project will decouple the chemical and electronic interactions introduced by oxygen moieties and reveal their true effects on the hydrogenation performance of supported palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles. Cinnamaldehyde and furfural will be utilized as probe molecules as they present both carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds - two functionalities common in bio-based chemicals. The associated fundamental understanding will yield transformative concepts for manipulating the performance of carbon-supported catalysts, in particular Pd/C and Pt/C, two catalysts with broad applications in the chemical industry.  Broader aspects of the project will include several educational and outreach activities highlighted by a student-led community-based program ""Be Iowa Smart"" that will attract a diverse group of students to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and build a competitive and globally engaged workforce in Iowa and the Midwest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, inspired by biological materials, like nacre and dental enamel, a novel metallic composite which combines amorphous alloys (called metallic glass) with crystalline metals, such as copper or aluminum, is shown to have an appreciable strength improvement without sacrificing its ductility. However, up to date, the development of such materials is still at a 'trial and error' stage because: (i) the integration of metallic glass with crystalline metals leads to a complex material microstructure spanning a wide range of length scales from nanometers at the atomic scale to microns; (ii) many existing techniques, which either resolve the material as a collection of atoms or approximate it as a deformable body without considering its internal structure,  are incapable to provide a full-scale interpretation on  how such material responds to a mechanical forces like tension, compression, or shear. This project supports research addressing these problems through a combined computational and experimental analysis of the deformation in metallic composites over a range of length scales. This research will link the atomistic deformation physics with its overall mechanical performance. Two fundamental questions to be answered are: (a) how does the interface between the amorphous and crystalline phases contribute to their co-deformation? (b) how to architect the metallic composite microstructure such that its failure can be delayed? This research will advance the field by providing researchers with a platform that can be used in a rational design of high-performance materials for a variety of engineering applications such as biomedical implants, aircraft structures, and energy infrastructures. It will expose the next-generation workforce to a broad range of knowledge and skills related to mathematics, physics, mechanics, supercomputing, materials synthesis, processing, and characterization. Moreover, several kits of metallic composites will be developed for illustrating how little changes of the volume amounts of each phase in composites can significantly change its properties. These kits will be presented to science teachers at Gilbert middle and high schools in Iowa for promoting science and engineering to K-12 students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>In the search of strong and ductile metallic materials, one strategy is introducing interfaces, such as grain boundaries and twin boundaries, to resist dislocation motions. This strategy is usually accompanied by a decrease in ductility although it does lead to an enhancement in strength. By contrast, instead of blocking dislocations, the amorphous-crystalline metallic composites utilize the amorphous phases to absorb dislocations, and may fundamentally change 'the strength-ductility dilemma'. Nevertheless, a methodical engineering approach for developing such composites is not achieved so far due to a knowledge gap in correlating its multi-level microstructure with the overall mechanical performance. This project supports research to fill this gap. The mechanical behavior of amorphous-crystalline metallic composites with microstructure complexities will be analyzed from the atomistic to the microscale. Concurrent atomistic-continuum models that resemble the microstructure of the amorphous-crystalline metallic composite fabricated at the Department of Energy-Ames Laboratory will be developed. Multiscale simulations of plastic flow in such material will be conducted to gain the insight into the interplay between dislocations and shear transformation zones. The intrinsic difference in mechanisms for the deformation in magnetron sputtered orthotropic nano-laminates and ball-milled polycrystalline aggregates will be identified. This research opens up the possibility of architecting the metallic composites microstructure for a desired property. Many aspects of this research will not be limited to metals but are readily extendable to other classes of materials, such as biomimetic ceramics, metallic glass-based composites for electromechanical devices, corrosion-, and radiation-resistant materials for nuclear power plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite being a 'trace element' (i.e., element of relatively low concentration) in most geological environments, its preferential enrichment in the chemically differentiated portions of the terrestrial planets - like Earth's continental crust - plays a key role in the presence of accessory minerals like zircon (ZrSiO4) and baddeleyite (ZrO2). In addition to being a cornerstone in the study of geologic time using the Uranium-Lead geochronometer, these accessory minerals are the main carriers of zirconium in the crust and are thus likely to preserve a unique yet unexplored record of the evolution of Zr isotope composition through geologic time. As such, understanding the processes that lead to variability in the isotopic composition of zirconium and how this is recorded in Zr-rich accessory minerals, may provide a window to explore the geochemical evolution of our planet in the deep geologic past, even beyond the oldest preserved rock record currently known in our planet.<br/><br/>Shifts in the bonding/coordination environment of tetravalent Zr ions in silicate magmas during zircon and baddeleyite crystallization are expected to result in fractionation (i.e., differential equilibrium incorporation) of its isotopes in precipitated solids and residual melts. This implies that small variations in the abundance of zirconium stable isotopes in terrestrial rocks and minerals have the potential to elucidate how this element behaves and fractionates in high-temperature geological environments. This award will support two early-career investigators to develop techniques to measure zirconium isotopic compositions at high precision and explore, for the first time, the stable zirconium isotopic composition of silicate Earth. The principal goals of this research are threefold:  1) To develop the laboratory materials (e.g., isotopic reference standard and isotopic tracers) necessary for making zirconium isotopic measurements at high-precision. This will be accomplished in collaboration with scientist from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), who in the future will continue to distribute the standard materials produced during this research; 2) To explore the range of variability in zirconium isotopic abundances of key reservoirs that comprise the solid Earth; 3) Using the newly gained knowledge, explore how variations in the isotopic composition of Zr may be linked to the development, evolution and chemical refinement of the Earth's crust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Better and longer stream-flow records will help improve water resource management in large and complex watersheds experiencing and anticipating drought and water supply shortages.  In places where measured runoff records are limited, tree-ring based streamflow records can be used to understand the range of possible variability and to therefore improve water management planning and modeling.  This technique has mostly been used in semi-arid environments with relatively simple surface hydrology.  This project implements and analyses tree-ring based streamflow modeling techniques in temperate, hydrologically complex watersheds, to assess its effectiveness, and thereby improving drought mitigation in those basins.  This research will be conducted in collaboration with local stakeholders, and has the potential to inform local water management plans, fish conservation, and ongoing negotiations of water and resource rights. Technical workshops will build capacity for stakeholders to incorporate these new records into their own decision-making framework.  The project provides field and academic learning opportunities for an undergraduate student and supports the continuing research program of an early career female Postdoctoral Research Scientist. <br/><br/>Large temperate watersheds are increasingly susceptible to the impacts of drought, but their complex hydrology complicates the application of flow reconstruction to water supply forecasting.  To accomplish meaningful tree-ring modeling in these basins, where multiple, shifting sources of runoff across several sub-basins mean that water management is reliant on seasonal streamflow information, this project directly targets drought-season runoff and decomposes the study watershed basin into independent main-stem and sub-basin reconstructions.  This project will compare a large network of tree-ring chronologies with meteorological, gridded climate, and instrumental streamflow data from the basin main-stem and sub-basin gauges.  Using these relationships as a guide for targeted chronology resampling, paleoclimate reconstructions of past summer runoff and drought will be developed for each basin spanning the last several centuries.  During the summer season a combination of snowmelt, air temperatures, and rainfall determine streamflow and each of these factors is also linked to radial tree growth.  The reconstructions will be statistically compared against independent estimates of past hydro-climate variability, model simulations, and independently developed climate fields to determine whether recent droughts have been exceptional in the last several centuries, and whether medium- and long-term internal hydro-climate variability contains a forced anthropogenic signal.  Updated chronologies will permit examination of a recent extreme drought event and estimates of the probability of similar-magnitude droughts in the future.  By targeting one of the most complex river basins in the world, the Fraser River Basin (FRB), this project provides a sound framework for enhancing water management in temperate watersheds in the United States and around the globe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Relationships between quantum-mechanical systems and their classical counterparts can be explored by investigating how the quantum-mechanical equations behave as the value of the parameter h tends to zero in some sense.  Pursuing this idea rigorously, however, involves subtleties.  Because h is not a dimensionless quantity, the ""smallness"" of values of the parameter must be expressed in terms of other relevant quantities.  This research project aims to deepen understanding of relationships between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics through rigorous mathematical analysis centered on the limit when the Planck constant h tends to zero.  The questions under study are of great interest both to mathematicians and to physicists.<br/><br/>This research project primarily concerns stationary states of quantum systems.  Global harmonic analysis is the use of the long-time dynamics of the geodesic flow of a Riemannian manifold to understand the high-frequency asymptotics of eigenfunctions.  Two of the most important goals of the project are (1) to analyze Lp norms of eigenfunctions and (2) to analyze nodal sets and critical point sets.  Making use of recent results relating geometric control and restrictions of eigenfunctions to hypersurfaces, the investigator aims to study nodal problems in non-ergodic situations and possible relations to the fractal uncertainty principle.  The project also includes exploration of several other topics, including the numbers of nodal domains of eigenfunctions on manifolds of higher dimension; Lp norms of eigenfunctions and microlocal Kakeya-Nikodym norms and their relations to analytic continuation to Grauert tubes; and the behavior of density of states of spectral projections for various Hamiltonians across natural interfaces such as energy surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The spatial distributions of stratospheric ozone, stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux, and ultraviolet radiation reaching to the lower troposphere under various climate states obtained from the project will become available to the tropospheric chemistry modeling community. The research results will be disseminated to the broader atmospheric and climate research community through scientific publications.  The proposal will support a Ph.D. student and a postdoc and provide interdisciplinary training in atmospheric dynamics and chemistry to the graduate student and postdoc. The research team is committed to public outreach, including developing educational videos and other outreach materials for grades K-12; giving public lectures on the research.<br/><br/>The Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) is the stratospheric meridional circulation that links the tropics and pole in the winter hemisphere. The BDC couples the troposphere and the stratosphere through the transporting of ozone-depleting gases from tropical troposphere to the stratosphere and then from the stratosphere to the troposphere in the mid- and high-latitudes, influencing the lifetime of trace gases such as methane.  By transporting stratospheric ozone from the tropics where it is produced to the poles, the BDC also determines the spatial distribution of the ozone column abundance that is the primary control on ultraviolet radiation penetration into the lower troposphere, playing an important role for driving atmospheric chemistry. During the cold climate of the LGM, both temperature and Brewer-Dobson circulation could be very different from the present day, because of different concentrations of radiative and chemical constituents (e.g., CO2, H2O, CH4, N2O, CFC), surface boundary conditions (colder sea surface temperatures, larger latitudinal temperature gradients and large ice sheets) and tropospheric circulations. <br/><br/>Recent work using ice core observations shows higher tropospheric ozone concentrations in cold climates relative to warm climates, indicative of the potential importance of stratosphere-troposphere ozone transport. However, there are very few studies on the BGC and ozone during the cold climate and there is no study so far quantifying the stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux and surface ultraviolet radiation during that time. Motivated by the recent findings from ice core observations, this research project will fill this knowledge gap by investigating the BDC and stratospheric ozone and quantifying the stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux and ultraviolet radiation and their impact on the tropospheric chemistry during the cold climate of the LGM.

This new knowledge will enable the translation of these high performance materials to applications in transportation, energy, and infrastructure. The research will be integrated into a series of educational activities for undergraduate students, as well as part of outreach to middle school students from underrepresented groups to inspire excitement in Materials Engineering.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the fundamental processing-microstructure-property relationships active during pulsed electric current (PEC) joining of Oxide Dispersion Strengthened alloys.

There are also inconsistent results across different studies which have been attributed to, among other factors, differences in the density and morphology of the biomass. This project will investigate mass transfer limitations within the biomass before and after supercritical carbon dioxide treatment to understand the impact of these limitations on conversion rates and extents. This project will advance the viability of supercritical carbon dioxide treatment as an effective biomass conversion strategy to produce high value chemicals. This work will also facilitate the development of new tools for studying chemical kinetics and transport phenomena associated with biomass conversion.<br/><br/>The evolution of biomass composition and morphology during supercritical carbon dioxide treatment is poorly understood, despite their demonstrated importance to conversion extent and efficiency. The objective of this project is to investigate the evolution of biomass morphology during supercritical carbon dioxide treatment in order to assess the role of mass transfer in the conversion of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. This objective will be achieved through experimental characterization of evolving biomass morphology with treatment duration through the use of established techniques and the development of novel techniques. Specifically, new insights into the evolution of biomass morphology for a range of biomass structures, densities and particle sizes will be gained. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide with environmentally benign co-solvents, such as water, has been shown to be effective at hydrolysis of biomass polymers via the formation of carbonic acid. Thus, research will focus on this co-solvent system and results will be incorporated into a model that accounts for hydrolysis chemistry and evolving biomass morphology to describe the conversion process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, work of Riemann on curved spaces later provided the mathematical language necessary for Einstein's theory of general relativity, which explains gravity in terms of curved spacetime. The broad framework, in which gravity is a paramount example, is known as field theory. Other key examples include the gauge field theories governing the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, which required physicists to use (and develop for themselves) non-trivial mathematical ideas from geometry, topology, and modern algebra. In fact, a systematic and rigorous mathematical framework that fully integrates these insights of physics is currently not available. This project aims to improve the situation by placing these field-theoretic ideas and techniques into the emerging subject of derived differential geometry, in particular, by developing a novel approach to derived differential geometry tailored with this application in mind. The Principal Investigators hope this effort will lead to a new language which facilitates communication between mathematicians and physicists.  They will explore the wealth of derived geometric objects that theoretical physics offers, focusing on connections with gauge theories.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators will develop foundations for derived differential geometry (DDG) custom-tailored for field theory and will work out concrete applications of this framework. On one hand, their approach will be similar to that of Toen-Vezzosi for derived algebraic geometry, allowing one to easily adapt their theory, tools, and techniques, specifically the theory of shifted symplectic and Poisson structures. On the other hand, with D. Roytenberg and R. Grady, they will incorporate a locally ringed approach to DDG, rooted in dg-manifolds and thus making it easy to import examples from physics. As a continual test and guide for developing our framework, they will carefully construct and investigate the derived critical locus of the Chern-Simons action functional, which can be thought of as a derived enhancement of the character varieties of 3-manifolds. With P. Teichner, the PIs will use this derived stack to relate quantum groups to the perturbative quantization of Chern-Simons theory. Finally, with R. Grady and B. Williams, the PIs will pursue a higher categorical analogue of work by Gelfand-Fuks-Kazhdan, Bott-Segal, and Haefliger, providing a natural home for invariants of smooth manifolds equipped with local structures, such as foliations, as well as for the anomalies to quantizing nonlinear sigma-models. The project will synthesize techniques from differential geometry, algebraic geometry, abstract homotopy theory, higher category theory, algebraic topology, and mathematical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will focus on providing a further stress test of the data to search for any evidence of alternative theoretical explanations for the cosmic acceleration, including modifications of the General Theory of Relativity. Important to the success of this program is an outreach component, which will be coordinated with the SUPA program at Syracuse University. The outreach will include communicating our results to local high school students and more broadly to improving the science curriculum throughout the state of NY and beyond.<br/><br/>The quality of data from cosmological probes of Dark Energy (DE) continues to grow at an impressive rate, whereas theoretical progress in our understanding of the underlying mechanism behind cosmic acceleration has been far more modest. As the accuracy of cosmological measurements continues to improve it is crucial to establish an economic and systematic way in which to use data to guide theoretical efforts to reveal the nature of DE.  The Effective Field Theory (EFT) of DE provides such an approach. By focusing on the fundamental symmetries of different DE models, rather than the details of a particular model realization, the EFT groups DE models into universal classes based on their general properties. This approach is analogous to the use of EFT methods in particle physics and condensed matter, where it has been very successful in connecting theory and experiment.   This project will focus on developing the EFT of DE to establish whether the EFT framework is robust enough to provide a uniform approach to the study of DE.

Light is an especially unique tool for causing chemical reactions that has many advantages: it can pass through barriers such as glass, travel long distances, and be switched on and off easily. To control matter with light, a particular type of light-sensitive chemical called a photochrome is especially useful. Photochromes are molecules that change structure and color when irradiated with light.  Photochromes also changes back to their original form when the color of light is changed or the light is removed. Examples of photochromic matter are glasses that become sunglasses outdoors, but are regular glasses indoors. The research group of Professor Samuel Thomas at Tufts University investigates new forms of photochromic matter: plastics that not only change color, but also dissolve in water when irradiated with light. Because light causes photochromic molecules to switch reversibly between two structures, these polymers can then be separated from water when the light is removed, allowing for ""on-demand"" control over the water solubility of these plastics. This fundamental research has the potential to benefit society by opening the door to a new class of aqueous nanomaterials that harnesses the power of light to remotely control their properties for eventual utility in encapsulation and release of drugs in biomedical applications, membranes with switchable permeability, and reversible adhesives. Beyond the hands-on training that this research provides to graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, this project also provides college students from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds with their first experiences in original scientific research. Professor Thomas continues his successful program of recruiting students from Bunker<br/>Hill Community College, as well as his partnerships in the Tufts Visiting and Early Research Scholars Experiences (VERSE) program, which recruits summer research students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. <br/><br/>Jointly supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry and the Polymers Program of the Division of Materials Research, this project develops a novel approach to control the properties of polyelectrolytes and enable the formation of new, self-assembled nanostructures and coacervates that undergo reversible, photoinduced phase changes as a result of charge shifting.  The first phase of this project is to establish how the structures of both spiropyran pendants on polymers and hydrophilic co-monomers influence the key properties of the photochromic units.  These properties include the acidity of protonated merocyanines, the quantum yields of merocyanine ring closures, and the rates of spiropyran openings. Measurements of photoinduced changes in solution pH and zeta potentials serve to correlate changes in optical properties to changes in polyelectrolyte charge.  The second phase of this project harnesses these systematically-derived structure-property relationships to develop reversible, photoinduced formation of polyelectrolyte nanostructures and coacervates through the corresponding changes in polymer charge at near-neutral pH. Further extension of these principles to photochromic block copolymers is aimed at reversible self-complexation and self-coacervation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Water trapped between the plates is thought to play an important role in controlling friction along the plate boundary and may explain large variations in earthquake activity along the Alaska Peninsula. This study will collect seafloor electromagnetic geophysical data to image the distribution of water in the sediments and crust along the plate boundary, with the goal of understanding how the transport and release of water in this critical region may regulate earthquake behavior and plate slip. This project will advance electromagnetic imaging as a new tool for studying subduction zones, and one that will help to image fluid volumes in key areas of the megathrust fault. The project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students at sea where they will learn how to collect and analyze marine electromagnetic data.<br/><br/>This project will use new marine electromagnetic (EM) imaging technology to study the fluid content of the crust and mantle along the Semidi and Shumagin sections of the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone. These sections of the subduction system have markedly different seafloor fabric entering the subduction zone trench and commensurately different seismicity. Data from a 2011 active seismic survey at this location show variations in sediment thickness and crustal fracturing along the incoming plate but are not able to fully constrain the amount and distribution of fluid. Passive and active EM data will be collected during a month-long cruise at 160 ocean-bottom stations along three trench-crossing profiles and one along-strike profile. Controlled-source EM data will image the electrical conductivity of the sediments and crust, while passive magnetotelluric data will map deep crustal and upper mantle conductivity. Together these data will constrain the hydration state of the incoming plate at the trench outer-rise, the distribution of fluids along the plate-interface beneath the forearc, and the release of fluids into the overlying forearc crust. The new EM data will be interpreted in conjunction with the existing seismic survey results to: (1) test the hypothesis that along strike variations in seismicity and plate locking are related to the fluid content of the incoming oceanic plate, which in turn is related to the pre-existing fabric in the plate and the orientation of this fabric with respect to the trench; (2) image and quantify fluids released from sediment dehydration along the surface of the down-going plate; (3) image and quantify zones of over-pressurized fluids and hydrofacturing of the overriding plate related to fluid release from the slab; (4) compare the conductivity structure at the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone with a similar profile at the Middle America Trench, an end-member system where seafloor faults are aligned parallel to the trench, potentially maximizing fluid-flux into the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite being a 'trace element' (i.e., element of relatively low concentration) in most geological environments, its preferential enrichment in the chemically differentiated portions of the terrestrial planets - like Earth's continental crust - plays a key role in the presence of accessory minerals like zircon (ZrSiO4) and baddeleyite (ZrO2). In addition to being a cornerstone in the study of geologic time using the Uranium-Lead geochronometer, these accessory minerals are the main carriers of zirconium in the crust and are thus likely to preserve a unique yet unexplored record of the evolution of Zr isotope composition through geologic time. As such, understanding the processes that lead to variability in the isotopic composition of zirconium and how this is recorded in Zr-rich accessory minerals, may provide a window to explore the geochemical evolution of our planet in the deep geologic past, even beyond the oldest preserved rock record currently known in our planet.<br/><br/>Shifts in the bonding/coordination environment of tetravalent Zr ions in silicate magmas during zircon and baddeleyite crystallization are expected to result in fractionation (i.e., differential equilibrium incorporation) of its isotopes in precipitated solids and residual melts. This implies that small variations in the abundance of zirconium stable isotopes in terrestrial rocks and minerals have the potential to elucidate how this element behaves and fractionates in high-temperature geological environments. This award will support two early-career investigators to develop techniques to measure zirconium isotopic compositions at high precision and explore, for the first time, the stable zirconium isotopic composition of silicate Earth.

The component on recognizing bias includes an application of the Implicit Association Test combined with zero-shot learning to understand the societal bias of web corpora. Mitigating bias includes bridging active learning with research on adversarial examples for AI models. Governing bias includes a qualitative and quantitative study of downstream bias effects. The research is designed to be tightly connected, as for example when the recognition of curation bias in datasets leads to techniques in mitigating bias through enforcing group fairness in deep learning to governing bias in deployed system through developing bias observatories. The study will include advancements in machine learning (decomposing deep architectures, adapting reinforcement learning, exploring domain adaptation), human-computer interaction (developing novel active learning techniques, studying model interpretability), and digital ethnography (studying the effect of AI bias on culture, establishing an AI bias taxonomy).

Algebraic K-theory is an invariant which can be applied to study basic objects from several fields of mathematics. In particular, algebraic K-theory can be used to study properties of fundamental objects in algebra, called rings. Although higher algebraic K-theory was defined more than 40 years ago, computational progress has been slow. Even for many basic rings the K-theory groups still aren't known today. Despite the difficulties, interest in K-theory computations remains strong. Algebraic K-groups have significant applications to algebraic geometry, number theory, topology, and other mathematical areas. Many of these applications are quite surprising, and the role of algebraic K-theory across mathematical fields drives a great interest in the subject. In recent years, advances in the field of algebraic topology have made it possible to study questions in algebraic K-theory which were previously thought to be inaccessible. A goal of this project is to use tools from algebraic topology to not only produce new algebraic K-theory computations, but also to develop the framework and theory to facilitate future study of algebraic K-theory and related invariants. In addition to the mathematics research goals, the project also includes work in undergraduate and graduate education, undergraduate research, conference organization, and efforts to increase the participation of women and underrepresented groups in mathematics.  <br/><br/><br/>This project uses the tools of equivariant stable homotopy to study algebraic K-theory and related invariants. Algebraic K-theory is an invariant of a ring which is generally very difficult to compute. However, there is a homotopy theoretic approach to K-theory computations that has been quite fruitful. Despite the fact that algebraic K-theory is not itself an equivariant object, the tools of equivariant stable homotopy theory have proven very useful for K-theory computations. This project explores the intricate relationship between equivariant homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, and related invariants such as topological Hochschild homology. The project will produce new K-theory computations as well as deepening our understanding of the invariants and tools used to make such computations. Further, this research will provide important foundations, structures, and examples for further work in equivariant stable homotopy theory. Specific research goals of the project are organized into three broader objectives: One, use recent results and new methods from equivariant stable homotopy theory to compute algebraic K-theory groups which were previously inaccessible. Two, develop the theory around related invariants such as topological Hochschild homology and topological coHochschild homology. Three, define and study equivariant algebraic structures that arise in K-theory computations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first set of questions concerns mathematically understanding behavior of photons in low-density plasmas. The second set of questions concerns the behavior of particles in fluid flow. In certain situations important for applications, particles diffuse in unusual ways.  This project investigates such ""anomalous"" diffusive behavior on intermediate (as opposed to long) time scales. The third set of questions is motivated by mathematically quantifying the entanglement of long polymer molecules; it aims to quantify the winding of trajectories of the related random walks. Each of these research projects involves graduate students and postdoctoral associates, who will be broadly trained through the course of their work. <br/><br/>This research will use tools from applied analysis, partial differential equations, and probability. The first set of questions concerns the long-time behavior of the Kompaneets equation, and focuses on understanding the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate. The second set of questions studies the small-noise limit of passive scalar transport and other related models arising in the context of fluids. While the long-time behavior of these equations is well known, here interest is in the small-noise intermediate-time regime where an anomalous diffusive effect is observed, and the limiting behavior is described by a time changed Brownian motion and time-fractional equations. The third set of questions studies the long-time ""winding"" or ""entanglement"" of Brownian trajectories on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary. This is closely related to heat kernel estimates on covering spaces, and is motivated by the study of the entanglement of long polymer molecules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the questions posed by geometers and topologists have to do with the nature of three-dimensional spaces sitting in a four-dimensional space, and with the restrictions that the global properties of larger space places on such sub-spaces. The research in this National Science Foundation funded project uses modern tools of analysis and geometry to shed light on the local nature of such subspaces, including new methods for showing that singularities in such spaces cannot be smoothed. Related analytical techniques will be used to explore the global topology of four-dimensional spaces, including an investigation of their symmetries.<br/><br/>Daniel Ruberman will carry out research in geometric topology, using Seiberg-Witten gauge theory, Heegaard-Floer homology, and more traditional topological techniques. The first parts of the project, joint with Jianfeng Lin and Nikolai Saveliev, are concerned with the smooth topology of four-manifolds that homologically resemble a product of a three-dimensional manifold with a circle. Central questions concern the interpretation of the classical Rohlin invariant and multi-signature invariants in terms of gauge theory; solutions of the main problems will decide the existence of manifolds predicted by high dimensional surgery theory. The PI will work with Adam Levine on embeddings of punctured three-manifolds in four-space, using refined techniques from Heegaard Floer theory to find obstructions.  An ongoing project with David Auckly, Hee Jung Kim, and Paul Melvin is concerned with the topology of the diffeomorphism group of a four-dimensional manifold and how it is affected by stabilization of the manifold. Finally, the PI will work with Saveliev and Demetre Kazaras on a new technique to obstruct the existence of positive scalar curvature cobordisms between even-dimensional manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, only a small percentage of introduced plants actually become problems, and one of the biggest challenges in invasive species management is to identify whether some species are 'pre-adapted' to invade - that is, have attributes in their home range that may identify them as potential threats before they are introduced. This project compares the performance of over 40 species of invasive plants in their home and invaded ranges across fields and forests in the Northeast U.S. and in similar climates of Europe and Asia. Combined with laboratory tests of leaf chemistry and structure, the investigators will determine whether invasive plants change in their invaded range in ways that make them better able to compete with native vegetation, or whether they already possessed these competitive attributes in their home range. The combination of field and laboratory measurements across a large range of species in multiple habitats will provide a unique set of data to identify the main constraints on leaf function. The project fosters international knowledge transfer and research partnerships through exchanges of senior personnel, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates between research labs. Results will contribute to land management practices through a better understanding of mechanisms behind successful invasions of non-native plants. The project enhances STEM education by increasing resource development and outreach activities for the ""Syracuse Global Change Garden"", an education-based arboretum on the Syracuse campus.<br/><br/>This project addresses the mechanism of ecological advantage of invasive plant species from two complementary angles. First, researchers will determine how plants of different photosynthetic capacity allocate a key limiting resource (nitrogen) to different leaf functions (light harvesting, carbon fixation, cell wall structure, defensive compounds) to test whether nitrogen allocation drives assimilation rate, and whether invaders have higher allocation to assimilation than co-occurring native species. Second, researchers will determine whether invasive species have altered their allocation to assimilation rate in their invaded range in response to reduced natural enemies, or whether photosynthetic advantages were already present in their native range due to different regional evolutionary histories. Finally, the investigators will test experimentally whether photosynthetic performance is the principal driver of competitive dominance in invaders. This project will be among the first to test invasion and leaf allocation theory empirically across a large number of species and habitats (forest and field environments), and to test the 'pre-adaptation' theory of species invasions at a physiological level. The project will also advance our understanding of invasion processes by determining whether shifts in leaf function commonly occur in the invaded range, and whether such processes are sufficient to alter interactions with native species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding Li-ion diffusion across these interfaces and its relationships with structures and compositions of interfaces is critical to addressing the challenges associated with interfacial impedance. This project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, probes ion transport through electrode-solid electrolyte interfaces by employing the tracer-exchange NMR method, to quantify Li deficiency with high-resolution depth-profiling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and determines interfacial resistance with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, under both ex and in situ conditions. This study provides insight into the critical factors that limit ion transport at the interfaces, which aids interface design for optimal electrode-electrolyte compatibility with minimized interfacial impedance. The researchers establish real time correlations among Li deficiency, diffusion, and interfacial resistance. Two model systems, Li/Li7La3ZrO12/Li and Li/Li10GeP2S12/Li, are chosen for their representativeness of oxide and sulfide electrolytes and their distinct differences at the Li electrode-solid electrolyte interfaces. Based on the experimental investigation, an analytical model is developed to quantitatively elucidate the impact of Li deficiency and diffusion on interfacial impedance. This model is implemented in the RandFlux software, for predicting the electrochemical processes and performance of all-solid-state rechargeable batteries. For this project, the principle investigator actively recruits students from a HBCU institution and engages women and minority students in the ongoing research.

The morphology that develops in these polymers is determined by processing conditions and dictates final electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. Conjugated polymers are typically processed through utilization of organic solvents, the use of which poses environmental concerns.  In contrast, melt-processing has received little attention, so the fundamental mechanism of crystallization from the melt state and the types of morphologies that can be attained for these polymers remain poorly understood. The research to be conducted here has potential to enable new solvent-free approaches for processing semicrystalline conjugated polymers with less environmental impact than their solution-processed counterparts, and to provide access to novel morphologies (and thus properties) not attainable through crystallization in the presence of solvents. This project explores how molecular attributes and melt-processing approaches can be employed to manipulate the crystallization process and the resulting semicrystalline structure. <br/><br/>This project will also seek to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in science by actively recruiting female and minority students, and will result in training of undergraduate students through research opportunities.  It will also involve training of graduate students in a field of great value in both academic and industrial settings. Results of this research will be broadly disseminated by publishing in relevant journals, presenting at conferences, and making materials and publications available online. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL  SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to control the melt crystallization process of a benchmark conjugated polymer by manipulating its nucleation behavior through self-seeding both under quiescent and flow conditions. For this purpose, the processes of nucleation and growth and the interplay of molecular attributes and processing variables during melt-crystallization will be explored. The obtained knowledge will allow control and optimization of the resulting semicrystalline morphology (which is key to optimizing properties) through solventless processing methods.  <br/><br/>The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. On one hand, it will advance fundamental knowledge of the mechanism of melt-crystallization of conjugated polymers, providing insight into the steps of nucleation and crystalline growth, the detailed morphologies that develop during crystallization from the melt state, and the specific role of polymer molecular attributes and well-defined processing conditions. The acquired knowledge will serve to establish similarities and discrepancies between the basic melt crystallization process of conjugated polymers and that of classical insulating polymers. On the other hand, this project will explore how solvent-free processing and selection of polymer chain characteristics (particularly molecular weight and molecular weight distribution) can be used to tailor semicrystalline morphology through manipulation of the nucleation step under quiescent and flow conditions. It is expected that some approaches developed for control of nucleation in traditional polymer melts may be applicable to conjugated polymers as well. Therefore, the proposed work will ultimately provide a framework that allows control of semicrystalline morphology when a conjugated polymer is crystallized directly from its melt state.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A multitude of research and project-type experience opportunities will be made available, in the form of NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates and the Vertically Integrated Projects programs.  <br/><br/>A primary goal of this project is to explore the peculiarities of implementing charge-recycling solutions at the scale of an industrial processor core down to a small application-specific integrated circuit node and ultimately deliver greener computing devices.  Innovative solutions are offered at the transistor-level, gate-level and computer architecture level.  Performance metrics that are industry-standard are adopted at each of these levels and will be used in the process of technology transfer of the developed novelties to industry.  The project entails transformative goals in disrupting the conventional CMOS-based digital logic design process in industry and enable more portable and increasingly faster computing solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It predicts the existence of bizarre objects like black holes and neutron stars, and ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves. These predictions motivated the construction of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which has detected several gravitational wave signals from colliding black holes and one signal from colliding neutron stars so far. For their efforts in making these detections possible, the leaders of LIGO were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. To obtain a deeper understanding about what produced the observed gravitational waves, LIGO data analysis compares observed waves with those predicted by Einstein's theory of GR for a very large number of possible scenarios. Construction of reliable theoretical models requires the full solutions to the equations underlying GR, provided by the field of numerical relativity. This project builds upon recent advances in this field to develop new software that greatly reduces the cost (in memory) of generating these solutions. Where before numerical relativity largely depended upon supercomputers, this new software will enable even consumer-grade desktop computers to generate needed theoretical predictions of merging black holes needed for LIGO data analysis. In the latter half of the funding period, the software will be made supercomputer-capable to enable (the far more memory-hungry) simulations of merging neutron stars on supercomputers with state-of-the-art accuracy. By unlocking the consumer-grade desktop as a powerful tool for numerical relativity, this project has the potential to enable the public to participate in the science in unprecedented ways. This will be made possible by incorporating this software into SETI@Home's ""BOINC"" volunteer computing infrastructure. The hope is that when LIGO detects a pair of merging black holes, thousands of black hole merger calculations will be launched for the benefit of LIGO science, each on a consumer-grade desktop computer running our ""BlackHoles@Home"" software. To educate the public and advertise this volunteer computing project both locally and globally, the West Virginia University group will give convocations in nearby high schools and write articles for the widely aggregated news site ""The Conversation"".<br/><br/>Numerical relativity (NR) solves Einstein's equations of general relativity (GR), in full, on the computer. Improvements to the algorithmic and mathematical underpinnings of NR codes have recently culminated in a coming-of-age for the field, moving it beyond proof-of-principle calculations and into the realm of predictive astrophysics. Over the past two years, NR-based theoretical predictions of gravitational waves (GWs) were central to uncovering the binary parameters in LIGO's recent GW discoveries. Now that the age of multi-messenger astrophysics has arrived, physical scenarios involving gravitational field and magnetized fluid dynamics spanning orders of magnitude in length scale and timescale will need to be modeled. NR codes bridge these scales by dynamically adjusting their spatial numerical grids to better sample the space, but current algorithms do not account for near-symmetries in these systems or rely on complex mesh algorithms. The proposed project involves the development of a new NR code with the unique goal of being both algorithmically simple and highly efficient, minimizing computational and human effort while maximizing scientific impact. We call it SENR, the Simple, Efficient NR code. SENR is unique in its aim to perform NR simulations of compact binary inspirals atop a single, dynamical, bispherical-like spatial grid. Exploiting near-symmetries in the underlying system can reduce computational cost over the most widely-adopted NR methods by orders of magnitude, and minimizing the grid management infrastructure greatly simplifies the interpretation of numerical errors and the addition of new physics modules. SENR builds on a new, highly-robust approach in NR for solving the GR field equations with hydrodynamics on static curvilinear spatial grids with coordinate singularities (e.g., spherical polar coordinates), and the PI's team is extending the approach to arbitrary, dynamical coordinate systems. Development of SENR is accelerated by a Python-based code-generation tool developed for this project called NRPy+. Following best-practices in software design, the small SENR codebase is carefully optimized after each major feature is added to maximize scientific impact. SENR's memory efficiency unlocks the desktop as a tool for NR, enabling us to launch the first major volunteer computing effort to generate an enormous NR-based GW catalog for binary black holes. Further, SENR's scalability will enable us to leverage supercomputing resources to generate a very large double neutron star GW catalog as well. Simplicity in infrastructure greatly reduces effort required to add new physics modules, and we plan to incorporate Monte-Carlo-based photon and neutrino feedback to enable state-of-the-art realism in our compact binary simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the intellectual foundations of celestial mechanics belong to antiquity, the field is more relevant than ever thanks to the advent of space exploration in the twentieth century.  Modern developments in dynamical systems theory provide deep insights, and by now several space missions have transformed inspired mathematics into successful practice.  The key to these developments is to understand certain landmark objects known as invariant manifolds, and to study connections between them.  In realistic applications the only way to discover these landmarks is through numerical computations.  Due to the global nature of these computations, questions involving errors and accuracy are both important and subtle.  These issues are treated with great care in the present project, ultimately leading to a mathematically rigorous framework describing all discretization and truncation errors.  The results provide practitioners of scientific computing with mathematically rigorous tools for quantifying computational errors, while providing mathematicians with new methods for proving theorems.  The investigator applies this new framework to problems in celestial mechanics that have resisted earlier analysis.  Doing so requires substantial advancement of both analytical and computational aspects of the theory.  The resulting infrastructure will be made freely available, and can be used to study other complex mathematical models.<br/><br/>A central theme of the investigator's research program is the unification of numerical and analytical methods for global analysis of nonlinear systems.  This project builds on the success of the investigator's earlier research, demonstrating its scalability and parallelizability.  The focus of the project is global analysis in gravitational N-body problems, an area with many longstanding unanswered theoretical questions and many opportunities for practical application.  One project numerically studies collision dynamics on a compactified phase space, while another answers questions about global branches of periodic orbits bifurcating from the polygonal central configurations of Lagrange.  A more computational aspect of the project develops a new approach to cluster computing and archiving of invariant manifold atlases, providing deeper understanding of the dynamics and new possibilities for space mission design.  Throughout, the work is guided by the principle that basic invariant sets like equilibria, periodic orbits, and heteroclinic/homoclinic connections between them are the fundamental building blocks for understanding complicated dynamics.  The resulting computer-assisted analysis is useful for studying other problems such as those involving geodesic flows, mechanical systems on compact manifolds, chemistry, and electrodynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes different combinations of symmetries might have the same overall effect, leading to ""relations"".  Abstractly, a group may be specified with a finite list of ""generators"" and relations among the generators, collectively called a presentation.  An important question in mathematics is whether two presentations define the same or similar groups.  Geometric group theory seeks to use geometric tools to differentiate groups, and to study their large-scale features.  This project will develop new tools to explore such large-scale features and to classify groups according to these features.  <br/><br/><br/>The primary focus of this project is to study groups which act properly discontinuously and cocompactly on non-positively or negatively curved spaces, particularly right-angled Coxeter groups (RACGs), geometric amalgams of free groups, and hyperbolic groups.

Geometric amalgams of free groups will be studied up to elementary equivalence, a notion of equivalence of groups coming from logic.  This will provide an illuminating class of examples illustrating deep theorems of Sela.  Furthermore, the project will study stable commutator length in RACGs, contributing to a growing program which has connections to the theory of quasimorphisms and bounded cohomology, and has applications in a variety of areas.

The strength and durability of metallic materials is limited by the conventional compositions and manufacturing technologies. In particular, aluminum alloys suffer from corrosion susceptibility when subjected to processing techniques used to increase the strength of many alloys. The development of new aluminum alloys, with concurrent high strength and corrosion resistance, requires new scientific knowledge of the mechanisms that control corrosion and deformation behavior in these materials. This award supports fundamental research to uncover these mechanisms of degradation and strengthening. The investigation will also support the development of the knowledge base and workforce for the nation's future. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this research will be trained to address future technological challenges in a multidisciplinary setting. The outcomes of the research will help in developing teaching materials to support the nation's first undergraduate program in corrosion engineering at the University of Akron, and to support K-12 outreach activities to work with the local communities and high school students to increase STEM awareness.<br/><br/>Use of aluminum (Al) alloys is limited in many applications due to their limited strength and deterioration of the corrosion performance with efforts made to increase their strength. Therefore, developing new Al alloys exhibiting ultra-high strength and excellent corrosion resistance is of paramount importance.  It is hypothesized that grain refinement < 100 nm and extended solid solubility of Vanadium (V) in Al can improve mechanical and corrosion properties simultaneously. Nanocrystalline Al-V alloys with a wide range of V content will be produced using high-energy ball milling. The alloys will be exposed to various heat treatments for studying the thermal stability and creating a wide range of grain size, V solid solubility, and intermetallic distribution. The role of the microstructure on passivation, corrosion initiation and propagation processes, and mechanical properties will be studied using state-of-the-art material and surface characterization, electrochemical and mechanical testing techniques. This investigation will advance scientific understanding of the: 1) influence of the processing on the structure, corrosion and mechanical behavior of the nanostructured Al-V alloys, 2) role of nanocrystalline structure, intermetallics, and extended solid solubility of V on the corrosion and mechanical properties, and 3) phenomena leading to the simultaneous improvement in corrosion and mechanical properties.

The world is rapidly losing biodiversity, and understanding how biodiversity loss will affect ecosystem services is important for human well-being. Most attempts to do this have used experiments in the field and laboratory. Natural communities, in which ecosystem services are provided, rarely look like experiments. Scientists acknowledge this, but it has been hard to study the effect of biodiversity loss on ecosystem services in the real world, in large part because of limitations in the analysis of complex natural communities. In this project, the researchers will use a new method that overcomes previous limitations to analyze some of the world's largest data sets, with the goal of understanding what aspects of natural communities are needed for ecosystem services. For example, is it enough to have many individuals of a few species, or do we need many different species to provide ecosystem services? This research will provide society benefits through a better understanding of how biodiversity influences ecosystem function, which could have relevance for science policy. Additionally, data and coding from the project will be made available to the public. <br/><br/>Knowledge of what drives ecosystem services at large scales is rudimentary, and the widespread belief that species richness is necessary for ecosystem services in natural systems is more of an assumption than an established fact. This project will use a novel and powerful analytical approach, based on the Price equation from evolutionary biology, to determine the importance of biodiversity to multiple ecosystem services. Specifically, the Price equation partitions differences in ecosystem services into three additive terms: richness, composition, and context dependence (which includes abundance variation as well as environmental factors). The PIs will compile the largest and most complete publicly-available data sets, and use them to conduct a synthetic analysis. The research will determine: (1) the relative importance of richness, composition, and context dependence in producing the mean levels and temporal variance of ecosystem services, (2) the role of spatial and temporal scale in ecosystem functions, and (3) the extent to which data from the worlds' largest biodiversity-function experiments align with results from ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many advancements in functionality of today's optical components are attained by using new or improved materials. The concept of metamaterials further enables this approach by offering artificially structured materials with properties absent in any natural materials system. One such unique engineered property, known as robustness, is found in specially designed structures referred to as topological metamaterials. Topological metamaterials allow guiding light with unprecedented insensitivity to obstacles and defects, inevitably present in any material or device, thus upending common notions of propagation and scattering of light. Most importantly, topological metamaterials offer a new platform for optical materials and devices exhibiting significantly higher tolerance to fabrication errors. In this project, we aim to design and test such optical devices, whose functionality is tolerant to both fabrication imperfections and environmental factors. This project is interdisciplinary in nature, bridging areas of fundamental and applied sciences. Significant outreach efforts towards high school and undergraduate minority students are planned. Activities for high school students from local schools include summer research conducted in the PI's laboratory through CCNY Summer Science Program.<br/><br/>Technical description: Topological photonics offers a fundamentally new vision on optical scattering, which may be exploited to manipulate the phase and amplitude of light in locally non-uniform ways. This suggests that open topological metamaterials with their topological modes leaking into a surrounding medium, such as two-dimensional metasurfaces patterned on the nanoscale, may offer new mechanisms of controlling scattering of light and thus enabling new approaches to generate desirable scattering patterns. On the other hand, the open character of the system, which renders photonic systems non-Hermitian, may itself affect topological properties of metamaterials in a nontrivial way. The goal of this project is to understand aspects of the interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity, and to explore the limits of topological robustness in open systems. Our research reveals the role of leakage of topological modes into free-space, and of their interaction with incident light. Understanding these properties enables a new class of topological optical devices endowed with topological protection. Within this project we aim to design and test topological gratings, metasurfaces, flat-lenses, and vortex phase plates.  The proposed research plan bridges areas of fundamental and applied science, optics, photonics, and condensed matter physics. The project presents opportunities for students from high-school to the graduate level to get involved in all stages of research, and to obtain hands-on experience in photonic materials and devices.

This unusual temperature range promotes the discovery of new materials. Metal flux reactions also facilitate the growth of new compounds as large crystals, which allows for the use of advanced characterization techniques such as single crystal X-ray diffraction to determine atomic positions, and oriented magnetic and transport measurements to explore the directionality of magnetic and electronic behavior.

Reactions of silicon with other elements in molten magnesium alloys are carried out to synthesize complex semiconducting compounds that may be useful for applications such as solar cells. Further understanding of metal flux chemistry is crucial to the advancement of synthesis science and the discovery of the next generation of magnetic and semiconducting materials.

Crystal structures are determined using X-ray and neutron diffraction, and magnetic and electronic properties are studied. Two areas are explored: the synthesis of a) magnetic intermetallic phases in lanthanide/transition metal eutectic fluxes, and b) semimetallic phases in magnesium-rich flux mixtures. The former produce new compounds with magnetic properties stemming from the combined contributions of both the lanthanide and the transition metal element. Developing the synthetic ability to control the formation of transition metal building blocks allows tailoring magnetic properties and improved understanding of complex phenomena such as spin glass behavior and long range magnetic ordering. Magnesium-based fluxes are proving to be fruitful growth media for metal silicides, which have potential as thermoelectric materials. Reactions of divalent metals (Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) with silicon in Mg/Al melts yield charge-balanced semiconducting or semimetallic phases complex structure types, which are potential alternatives to telluride thermoelectrics. Additionally, researchers explore effects of varying heating profiles in order to isolate intermediate phases before their conversion to more thermodynamically favored products, as well as trends in reactivity, effects of element substitution on formation of common structural building blocks, and structure-property relationships. Furthermore, this work expands the understanding of metal flux chemistry, with the goal to control the process of these reactions and target desired compounds.

To further develop the methodology, this research seeks a better understanding of the polymerization process in order to achieve greater control of the lengths of such molecular strings.

Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students receive training in cutting-edge small molecule and polymer synthetic methods, along with complex analytical techniques through engaging in this interdisciplinary research project. Professor You is actively involved in a number of outreach activities, including the UNC Science Expo (part of the North Carolina Science Festival).

Long term, this research has implications on the development of implantable medical devices including artificial joints and valves. Critical for such applications is for the protein to be effectively integrated into the devices. To this end, there is interest in attaching peptides and proteins to non-biological surfaces and materials reliably. The interface between the biomolecules and surface has properties are related to, but quite distinct from, those of the biological components and of the original surface. The three-dimensional structure and resulting function of proteins linked to surfaces can be radically different than in solution.  Defining these differences is challenging. The research group of Dr. Lauren Webb at the University of Texas at Austin is addressing these challenges using a multidisciplinary research program focused on the investigation of biomolecules on rationally-designed and precisely-prepared surfaces. Dr. Webb fosters the participation of high school students in research in her own laboratories. Special emphasis is placed on increasing recruiting efforts in Texas high schools so that the diversity of students engaged in research reflects the diversity of the population of Texas. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that the integration of biological molecules with non-biological materials is an area of current scientific interest, the understanding of the differences between the structures and properties of biomolecules attached to surfaces versus biomolecules in solution is relatively limited. Dr. Webb's research addresses the lack of fundamental understanding of what happens to biomolecules such as peptides and proteins in these alternative, substrate-bound environments. Dr. Webb's laboratory is using a unique chemical platform and an advanced set of analytical tools to address these fundamental questions from both an experimental and computational perspective. Gold surfaces are chemically functionalized with the electron-transfer protein azurin and studies of the protein's function are aimed at exploring conditions under which the gold remains stable. The research elucidates the mechanism of nucleation and formation of fibrils from surface-bound strand peptides. It also examines the influence of hydration of nominally dry surface-bound protein on the protein's structure and function. The experimental results are leveraged towards the development, testing, and validation of computational methods that may accurately predict the structure of proteins and peptides attached to artificial surfaces. Dr. Webb's long-term goal is to advance of the chemical understanding of peptides and protein behavior at surfaces so that the understanding reaches similar accuracy and predictability when compared to what is currently possible for solution-phase systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fundamental understanding of the quantum behaviors of these systems is crucial for developing novel materials and molecules with tailored properties and can also lead to the prediction of new states of matter.<br/><br/>The development of novel algorithms and software for solving the equations of quantum mechanics that describe systems of many interacting constituents remains one of the most important theoretical techniques. The PI is the inventor of one of the most prominent of these algorithms, the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and continues developing ITensor, a widely used software library for carrying out these calculations. Building on the PI's work, a large international group of scientists has extended DMRG to a new field of physics, tensor networks, with applications ranging from chemistry to the physics of black holes and to the quantum theory of gravity. The PI's current work is focused on quantum spin liquids and on high-temperature superconductivity. Spin liquids are a novel state of matter whose unusual properties could enable building a quantum computer, which can solve certain problems exponentially faster than any currently existing computer. High-temperature superconductivity is important for both fundamental reasons as well as for applications. Conceptually, understanding how high-temperature superconductivity works is considered one of the most important problems in condensed matter physics. High-temperature superconductors are already used in a number of important applications, such as wireless communications and power transmission. Unraveling how high-temperature superconductivity emerges in certain materials might enable the creation of long-sought room-temperature superconductors.<br/><br/>This research provides excellent opportunities for training the next generation of theoretical scientists.

The work consists primarily of simulating model systems and of developing new algorithms for enabling these simulations. The primary application of the work is to frustrated spin systems and to doped fermion systems (such as the high-temperature superconductors), which suffer from the sign problem that makes quantum Monte Carlo methods ineffective. Of particular interest are spin liquid systems, a novel state of matter that can occur in frustrated spin systems. Spin liquids exhibit topological order, and their unusual properties could be used for eliminating decoherence, a requirement for creating a quantum computer. Experimental studies sometimes cannot distinguish between disordered spin systems and true quantum spin liquids; this project will clarify which systems are true quantum spin liquids. The project also involves studying high-temperature superconductors, in particular the competition between stripes and other inhomogeneities with superconductivity, and the nature of the pseudogap phase. Of particular interest is studying the effect of long-range Coulomb interactions between electrons and their effect on the competition between stripes and superconductivity.<br/><br/>The PI is the inventor of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), one of the leading algorithms for simulating 1D systems. Within the last decade, DMRG has become part of a larger field, tensor networks, and has become closely associated with quantum information science. The PI's work in algorithms now incorporates many of the ideas of tensor networks. The PI will further develop ITensor, a widely used software library for carrying out DMRG and tensor network calculations.<br/><br/>This research provides excellent opportunities for training the next generation of theoretical scientists.

Led by Alabama A&M University (AAMU), a historically Black College and University, the project is well-positioned to prepare students from under-represented groups to teach in high-need learning environments in northern Alabama. Achieving this goal will also help meet a national need to diversify the teaching workforce.  The goals of the Those Who Can Teach project are to:  (1) increase the pool of highly-qualified science and mathematics teachers working in high-need schools, including high-need rural schools in northern Alabama; (2) improve recruitment and retention efforts of STEM majors as secondary teachers; (3) implement a challenging curriculum to ensure Noyce Scholars are competent in content, pedagogy, and cultural diversity; and (4) support project participants to ensure their success during their pre-service and induction periods.  Selected first- and second year students will participate in a week-long teaching-focused internship, with the goal of increasing their interest in teaching and in the Noyce Scholars program.  Noyce Scholars will receive scholarship support in their junior and senior years, and induction support once they are teaching.  Scholars will be required to teach for two years in high-needs school districts for each year of scholarship support.  The Those Who Can Teach project will focus on placing Noyce Scholars in partnering school districts, to teach in schools where critical teacher shortages in science and mathematics have been identified.<br/><br/>Three Alabama community college partners, Calhoun Community College, Lawson State Community College, and Drake State Community College will collaborate with AAMU to recruit and place 21 undergraduate STEM Scholars in secondary science and mathematics classrooms.  Working closely with the Admissions Office, Freshman Academy, and the Registrar's Office at AAMU and the community college partners, the project will identify enrolled first-year, second-year, and transfer students who are majoring in STEM disciplines.  Targeted robust recruitment strategies, including social media, will be used to attract STEM majors into teaching careers.  The project intends to award 50% of the scholarships to community college transfer students.  For Scholars who complete the teacher preparation program and certification requirements, the project will help them obtain employment in high-need schools in partnering school districts (Huntsville City, Madison County, and Limestone County).  The Those Who Can Teach project expects that its program evaluation efforts will provide a deeper understanding of how STEM students can be placed on a path to teaching.  By working with community college partners and school districts, the project may be able to establish a pathway for STEM majors to become secondary teachers and to learn how project supports contributed to the retention and success of the 21 certified teacher Scholars.  After successful project implementation, other communities experiencing a shortage of science and mathematics teachers may benefit from the strategies and approaches used to recruit, prepare, place, and support STEM majors on the pathway to teaching in secondary science and mathematics classrooms in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results of this study will guide the design and manufacture of high-performance materials for use in industrial pollution control processes that convert toxic compounds to benign products while meeting the environmental standards.<br/><br/>This experimental and modeling effort will be focused on both material and process design and development. Specifically, the PIs will synthesize hierarchical mixed-metal oxides (MMOs), deposited with mono and bimetallic nanoparticles (noble and transition metals), using atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. The ALD-designed hybrid adsorbent-catalyst materials with hierarchical pore structure are used in the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, known as BTX compounds, from air in a TSA system. Such hybrid materials will act as a selective mass sink for the adsorbate to create favorable concentration profiles for the oxidation reaction, which will in turn provide heat to regenerate the hybrid materials during the desorption step, thus effectively conserving energy through efficient heat integration. The PIs will also address the design, configuration, process modeling and optimization of the TSA process to improve capture-oxidation efficiency and enable significant reductions in the abatement cost through synergistically exploiting the inherent advantages of each technology. The educational and outreach plan will serve as a platform for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, especially from underrepresented groups, to develop interest in cutting-edge scientific research.

The research presented in this project will significantly advance the theoretical understanding of those iterative algorithms by unveiling the statistical and computational guarantees as well as potential pitfalls for statistical inference. The wide range of applications of EM, mean-field variational inference, and Gibbs sampling ensure that the progress we make towards our  objectives will have a great impact in the broad scientific community which includes neuroscience and social sciences. Research results from this project will be disseminated through research articles, workshops and seminar series to researchers in other disciplines. The project will integrate research and education by teaching monograph courses and organizing workshops and seminars to help graduate students and postdocs, particularly minority, women, and domestic students and young researchers, work on this topic. In addition, the PI will work closely with the Yale Child Study Center and the Yale Institute for Network Science to explore appropriate and rigorous algorithms for neuroscience, autism spectrum disorder, social sciences, and data science education.<br/><br/>The PI studies these iterative algorithms by addressing the following questions: 1) what is the sharp (nearly necessary and sufficient) initialization condition for the algorithm to achieve global convergence to optimal statistical accuracy? 2) how fast does the algorithm converge? 3) what are sharp separation conditions or signal strengths to guarantee global convergence? 4) what are the estimation and clustering error rates and how do they compare to the optimal statistical accuracy? There are three stages to developing a comprehensive theory for analyzing iterative algorithms: 1) studying statistical and computational guarantees of EM for Gaussian mixtures for both global parameter estimation and latent cluster recovery, 2) extending EM to mean-field variational inference and Gibbs sampling, and considering a unified analysis for a class of iterative algorithms, 3) extending Gaussian mixtures and Stochastic Block Models to a unified framework of latent variable models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They enable researchers and practitioners to exchange information reliably, apply a variety of tools to their problems, and reproduce scientific results.  The COmputational MOdeling in Biology NEtwork (COMBINE) was created in 2010 to organize standardization efforts for systems biology.  This effort includes, among others, the systems biology markup language (SBML) for mathematical models created by systems biologists; and the synthetic biology open language (SBOL) for describing genetic designs created by synthetic biologists. While systems biology and synthetic biology have many unique requirements, there are also a lot of overlapping features such as the need to construct mathematical models, describe pathways, and provide visual representations.  The COMBINE meetings bring together representatives from both fields to enable these communities to share existing standards, software, and other infrastructure. This project will help enable US-based students from these two communities, particularly those new to these efforts or from underrepresented groups, to meet together at the 2018 COMBINE Forum to be held at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts on October 8th to 12th (http://co.mbine.org/events/COMBINE_2018). <br/><br/>Workshops like this one are instrumental in making progress in the development of these standards. Currently, most standardization efforts are either unfunded or only have very limited support.  Indeed, the success of these standards has been due to the donation of time from many individuals to participate in discussions, write specifications, serve as standard editors, and attend workshops.  Many of these individuals working on the development of these standards are students based in the US who would otherwise find it difficult to find the funds to attend this meeting.   Therefore, this project would help support travel expenses for these US-based students working on these standards to travel to Boston for COMBINE 2018.  Not only would this be a valuable experience for these students, but it would also greatly enhance the synthetic biology community's goal of bringing together researchers in synthetic biology with those working in systems biology leading to integrated standards and shared software and infrastructure.  The goals of this workshop will be to continue to (1) develop synergistic relationships between systems and synthetic biology researchers; (2) provide a tighter integration of standard development for systems and synthetic biology; (3) perform outreach to modelers and experimentalists; and (4) discuss a coordinated effort to advocate the use of standards in publications and archival databases to enhance reproducibility of scientific results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both are in the Division of Chemistry. Professor Daniel Scherson of Case Western Reserve University is developing and using hardware and electroanalytical methods for ultrafast charge injection across electrode/electrolyte interfaces. This capability enables fundamental studies of electrochemical phenomena at timescales down to the nanosecond (ns) regime. These new ultrafast electronics are combined with spectroscopic techniques such as second harmonic generation (SHG), sum frequency generation (SFG), and differential reflectance spectroscopy. This work will provide the means to answer fundamental questions about the dynamics of short-lived adsorbates and reactive intermediates. The behavior of electrode and electrolyte interfaces are highly relevant to a wide-range of electrochemical applications. Electrochemical surface science lies at the juncture of chemistry, physics and a wide number of engineering fields, such as materials and electronics. The scientific advances will impact wide ranging areas of practical importance such as energy conversion, corrosion mitigation and sensor technology. Students pursuing research in this area become exposed to a very broad range of both fundamental and applied disciplines. This type of training will produce students especially suited to face the challenges posed by a multitude of important and unresolved problems in environmental remediation, energy conversion, energy storage, biosciences, and microsensor technology. <br/><br/>The primary objectives of this work are to develop and implement experimental techniques to achieve potential control across electrode/electrolyte interfaces in the nanosecond regime, and to monitor the subsequent time evolution of the interface using spectroscopic techniques with the highest sensitivity and specificity and temporal resolution. Attention is focused on ultrafast charge injection tactics employing electronic circuitry and electrochemical cell architectures designed in collaboration with Tektronix (Keithley). These is validated using selected model systems involving both well-defined single crystal metal substrates and adsorbate layers. The response of the systems to such fast electrical perturbations is monitored using linear and non-linear spectroscopic probes, including normalized differential reflectance, and second harmonic, (SHG) and sum frequency generation (SFG). The actual model systems investigated include: electron transfer in self-assembled monolayers bearing redox active terminal groups as a function of the distance from the electrode surface, order/disorder transitions in halide adsorbate layers on single crystal silver, and hydrogen adsorption/desorption on Pt(111) as a function of pH. Also explored is the use of ultrafast current pulses applied to the solution in order to modulate the electrostatic potential across the interface and thus the overpotential driving the interfacial events. It is expected that the experimental data resulting from this research will serve to validate theoretical predictions emerging from the fast developing field of interfacial dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, the modeling of a wide class of physical phenomena, such as crystal growth and flame propagation, involves tracking fronts that move with curvature-dependent speed. When a surface evolves with speed that is proportional to the curvature, this results in one of the classic degenerate nonlinear differential equations called the mean curvature flow.  For nonlinear equations like this, it is possible that solutions may develop sharp points and corners, so it is natural to ask ""what is the regularity of solutions?''  Optimal regularity for mean curvature flow was recently proven by the PI and Minicozzi.  The proof weaves together analysis and geometry. It is expected that many of the new ingredients and techniques should lead to many other results for a wide range of equations that the PI will investigate in this project.<br/><br/>This project has two parts. The main part concerns geometric evolution equations, like mean curvature flow (MCF) and Ricci flow. It deals with optimal regularity and applications.  The PI has, together with Minicozzi, settled a number of long-standing open problems and conjectures for mean curvature flow and expect that the results and ideas developed will have significant applications also to other flows and plan to pursue them.  Rigidity of prevalent singularities and uniqueness of blow-ups has had a wide range of applications for mean curvature flow from optimal regularity of the level set equation to optimal estimates on the singular set of the flow.  The PI plans on investigating similar conjectures for the Ricci flow.  The second part of the project will deal with other (non-geometric) evolution equations that are motivated by questions in social science and engineering.

Alternatively, we can create a dual surface, where we make new triangles with a vertex for each of the original ones, and sides corresponding to the touching data of the original triangles. Poincar's amazing theorem from 1895 tells us that the dual shape is deformable to the original, regardless of the way cuts were done. Since its discovery, this duality result has been improved on and generalized in many different areas of mathematics. In homotopy theory one not only studies objects up to deformations, but also keeps track of deformations between them as well as coherence data, all in a streamlined way. Along with its recent augmentation into derived algebraic geometry, homotopy theory has become a unifying ground for numerous mathematical concepts, including duality.  <br/><br/><br/>The PI will work with her collaborators to explore two duality contexts in which homotopical and arithmetic information are intertwined. One of those involves establishing a homotopical extension of a classical result of Poitou and Tate about duality in the cohomology of number fields, as well as investigating the implications of such an extension to questions in arithmetic. The other involves understanding duality for some of the basic objects in so-called chromatic homotopy theory, whereby one organizes structural and computational information in homotopy according to periodicity properties. This would be a homotopical enhancement of a cohomological duality property of the chromatic Galois groups known as Morava stabilizer groups, and is based on seminal work of Gross and Hopkins. Both of these project goals may involve further developing the foundations for profinite group actions on profinite objects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lakes are often conceived as closed systems. However, most lakes have a river outlet or inlet and are part of the river network. Too much sediment in rivers and lakes may be a pollutant, while too little sediment in rivers may cause destructive erosion of riverbanks and starve coastal communities of sediment needed to maintain elevation and ecosystems. Understanding river-lake networks as systems and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) lake footprints at the continental scale will advance our knowledge of hydrologic scaling laws; how rivers are shaped; and how water, sediment and materials are transported from continental interiors to coastal oceans. Understanding the structure and scaling properties of river-lake networks, lake footprints in river networks, and how natural and artificial lakes differ in their controls on sediment transport requires a data-intensive approach that combines geospatial, remote sensing, and in-situ data across the entire continental United States. Relationships for scaling the number, size, and spacing of in-network lakes with river size will be derived, and lake footprints and proxies for sediment trapping efficiency will be estimated using remote-sensing data calibrated with in-situ suspended SSC data. Lake footprints include the recovery of SSC downstream of lakes and the attenuation of SSC above and within lakes.<br/> <br/>Web applications and visualization tools will merge satellite and field observations of inland waters to help connect people to their local watersheds. End users will be able to explore the structure of river-lake networks in their watershed to increase awareness of river-lake connectivity; integrate satellite data into education and research; and conceptually merge rivers and lakes. Sediment content of rivers and lakes will be shared with water resource scientists and managers, and the public. This research will advance of our understanding of U.S. watersheds in three main areas: 1) the development of a physical template for river-lake network models and analytical expressions of lake distribution within river networks; 2) identification of the type, size, and location of lakes that impact river geomorphology; and 3) signatures of anthropogenic impacts on sediment transport in rivers networks by comparing natural and artificial lakes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework in which Bayesian learning can be carried out directly in terms of only the features of interest.  This reduces the modeling and computational burden on the data analyst and provides new insights about Bayesian learning more generally<br/><br/>A Bayesian approach is a powerful and rigorous framework for statistical learning.  The downside is that it requires a full model for the observables as well as all unknown quantities, the specification of which can be a burden on the data analyst. In addition to the familiar challenges of prior specification, there are also risks of misspecification biases. A more subtle complication is due to selection effects that result from considering several candidate models.  The data analyst's burden is further exaggerated in situations where only a feature of the unknowns is of interest, i.e., when there is an interest parameter and a (potentially high-dimensional) nuisance parameter and inference is required only for the former.  That is, the Bayesian approach still requires that the data analyst make non-trivial efforts to specify prior distributions and carry out posterior computations relevant only to the nuisance parameter, which can be viewed as a waste.  Yet having access to a posterior distribution for inference on the interest parameter is still a desirable feature, and the proposed research aims to develop a new framework for posterior inference directly on interest parameters.  These direct posteriors (DiPs) effectively target the interest parameter, giving data analysts an opportunity to avoid the seemingly wasteful modeling and computation efforts involving nuisance parameters.  This project will construct DiPs for finite- and infinite-dimensional interest parameters with rigorous theoretical guarantees, and will also develop efficient computational tools to facilitate DiP-based inference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In most cases, this collapse leads to a supernova (SN) explosion, but it is believed that some stars collapse directly to a black hole without exploding, an outcome known as a ""failed supernova.""  A research group at the Ohio State University will use a multifaceted observational and theoretical approach to better understand the fates of massive stars and the formation of black holes.  To do this, they will use the twin 8.4-meter Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) to monitor all of the massive, mature stars in 27 nearby star-forming galaxies.  This will allow them to confirm the first candidate failed supernova, measure the properties of SN progenitors, and explore the boundary between the faintest SNe and stellar outbursts.  While doing so, the project will advance the training of students and broaden the public's understanding and interest in the science of stars and their complicated roads to death.<br/><br/>Searches for the progenitors of SNe are finding a deficit of high mass progenitors. This deficit can be explained if about 20% of core collapses fail and produce a black hole without a SN explosion. This failed SN fraction also naturally explains the compact object mass function.  Very few SN progenitors are well characterized, making it difficult to determine the mapping between progenitors and outcomes. The Ohio State program will yield roughly one well-characterized progenitor each year.  It will also pioneer the study of low-level progenitor variability, as a balance to SN searches that are detecting small numbers of bright outbursts shortly before SN explosions.  This project will also explore the late time properties and evolution of mysterious, low luminosity, SN-like objects, and may validate modern theoretical surveys of core collapse outcomes that suggest weak SN occur in several different mass ranges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These blooms have become a major concern when it comes to water safety and management as they can have severe impacts on public health, aquatic ecosystems, and local economies. Current methods for toxin detection include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction, high performance liquid chromatography, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. These methods require complex operation, fluorophore labeling, sophisticated and bulk instruments, and skilled personnel. Additionally, these methods take days for analysis, cannot be easily performed in the field, and cannot determine multiple toxins at the same time. Therefore simple and low cost detection technologies that can meet this challenge are critically needed in recognition of the importance of water quality monitoring and environmental protection. The development of novel sensors for detection of toxins in water can revolutionize our understanding of aquatic ecosystem functions governing water quality at the watershed scale.   For example, it can be accomplished, in part, by assembling a portfolio of novel sensors for on-site real time multiplexing monitoring of the biotic and abiotic compartments within the water cycle.  The pervasive networking of these sensors will enable process monitoring at spatial and temporal scales that are much higher than is currently feasible.   Integrating these data streams into simulation models of the water cycle will deepen our understanding of these processes, facilitate the development of real-time indices to forecast events such as algal blooms, and identify strategies that can be followed to avert such events. The outcome of the research will be integrated in the outreach activities include working with industry for validation, field testing in Lake Erie, publicizing the technology through annual ""Media Day"" at OSU Stone Lab, ""Nanobiotechnology Summer Camp"" and ""Adopting a Class"" from local school students. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop GaN (gallium nitride) based immunologically field effect transistors biosensors for detection of extracellular and intracellular cyanotoxins in water and environmental samples. The proposed devices are capable of label-free multiplexing detection rapidly (in minutes) by both immuno-sensing and nucleic acid detection as necessary. These sensor devices can be fabricated in a large array system with each device using distinct antibodies, so that a full profile of contaminants can be achieved by a single low cost test. Due to the fact that these devices can be fabricated at very small sizes and monitored at the individual device level, each sensing array can detect potential toxins at extremely low concentrations.  Although this kind of biosensors have been demonstrated for other biosensing applications, their application to cyanotoxin detection and monitoring has yet to be demonstrated. The team choses AlGaN (aluminum gallium nitride)/GaN heterojunction semiconductor structures as the device platform because this material system is chemically inert and stable so a high signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved. The proposed toxin sensors can meet the following  requirements: (1) high sensitivity or low detection limit and large dynamic range; (2) high specificity and multiplexing detection; (3) rapid detection and short analysis time; (4) label free; and (5) field-portability and easy-of-use, capable of detection of both extracellular and intracellular toxins, and forming a sensing network for long term environmental monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Underpinning technological advancement in this area is the ongoing progress in fundamental understanding of magnetism and magnetic materials. In this project, a fundamental problem relevant to ""spin electronics"" is being tackled, specifically how electron spins relax after being pumped from magnetic to non-magnetic materials. This is a poorly understood issue in magnetism, despite many scientific efforts and high importance for next generation devices. In this work, a particular type of nanomagnetic device is being used to understand, quantitatively, and for the first time, how specific materials defects control the relaxation of spins. In addition to advancing basic scientific knowledge, broader impact is being achieved through societal benefits from device applications, through education of students, and through outreach to the public. The latter involves collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota, developing exhibits and performances on the science of materials in our everyday lives, thus raising awareness of the role of materials research in our society.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>Central to many spintronic phenomena and devices is the flow of a pure spin current, or a spin-polarized charge current, in a non-magnetic metal. A fundamental question in such a situation is over what distance does a non-equilibrium spin population relax in a non-magnetic metal, or: what is the spin diffusion length? Remarkably, while the basic mechanism governing metallic spin relaxation, the Elliot-Yafet mechanism, is known, there remain massive gaps in our understanding of this process. The individual effects of specific defects remain unknown, preventing quantitative or predictive understanding of spin transport. Addressing this problem, with its obvious technological relevance, would constitute a transformative advance. The essence of this project is to use non-local lateral spin valves to determine spin diffusion lengths in a variety of conventional and oxide-based metals. Elemental metals such as Al are being studied to separately quantify spin relaxation due to phonons, impurities, grain boundaries, surfaces, and interfaces, thus determining Elliott-Yafet constants for each defect. Metallic perovskite oxides are also being studied. These materials offer tremendous potential for spintronics, although an understanding of their spin diffusion lengths remains elusive. A progression from conventional metal-based devices to perovskite metals is being followed in this research, providing the first understanding of spin diffusion lengths in oxide ferromagnets and non-magnetic metals, a critical step in the development of oxide spintronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to help meet the national need for new STEM teachers who can serve in diverse rural school settings. To accomplish this goal, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, will collaborate with Pellissippi State Community College (PSCC) will and five East Tennessee school districts (Anderson County, Campbell County, Claiborne County, Lenoir Count, and Sevier County). The goal of VFA is to grow and diversify the STEM teacher workforce by supporting community college students to become STEM teachers. Located in the heart of Appalachia, the East Tennessee region is experiencing a persistent shortage in mathematics and science teachers that is increasingly compounded by many retiring teachers.  VFA will support 32 high-potential Noyce Appalachian Scholars, recruited from PSCC, as they become STEM teachers. Scholars will devote at least their first four years of teaching to high-need school districts. VFA aims to accomplish this goal by recruiting students and providing them with summer internships, enhanced coursework, academic supports, and out-of-classroom experiences.  The research results and lessons learned from this project will be shared nationally to help address the need for highly prepared STEM teachers who will teach and inspire the next generation of STEM professionals and problem solvers. <br/><br/>By effectively connecting University of Tennessee with PSCC faculty, VFA aims to select community college students as Noyce Appalachian Scholars, and support them to complete a bachelor's degree in a STEM major with a minor in education and receive a teaching certification. Scholars will complete the program under the guidance of master teachers, STEM faculty, and STEM education faculty. VFA's recruitment plan will include delivery of a STEM Teaching and Learning course at PSCC, along with a four-week summer internship that aims to inspire first-year students' love of STEM teaching. VFA's program development will include refocusing coursework to support learning about Culturally Relevant Pedagogy. Additional program supports for Scholars will include academic coaches, supplemental instruction, transfer coaches, content area advisors, education advisors, and out-of-classroom experiences. Scholars will receive scholarship support for two years, along with community learning and building and tailored supports. VFA aims to contribute to the knowledge base about teacher preparation, recruitment, and retention, especially in high-need school districts. The project's research components will focus on: (1) identity in relation to culturally responsive teaching; and (2) the study of the VFA model of STEM teacher preparation. Such research has the potential to inform coursework design and resources that support preservice teachers' learning of and identification with culturally relevant pedagogy.

Current methods in spatial statistics are unable to cope with such highly multivariate datasets; this research addresses this gap in statistical science, aiming to establish a new framework for multivariate spatial models. The testbed for the new framework is in the field of climate data science. Understanding of the Earth system relies on coupled physical models that represent the dynamic evolution of the atmosphere, ocean, land use, rivers, glaciers and other processes. These models have led to vast amounts of climate model data that severely constrain storage resources. Moreover, statistical emulators are increasingly common and desirable alternatives to running complex physical models directly. Development and validation of compression and emulation algorithms require understanding and maintaining complex dependencies between physical variables, but current tools are univariate or pairwise-based. This research will provide statistical guidance for climate data science applications.<br/><br/>This project focuses on a modeling framework for multivariate spatial processes, and relies on new theory incorporating graphical models in multiscale multivariate spatial process representations.  Moreover, many multivariate datasets exhibit non-Gaussian behavior.

These complex materials are of technological importance as they can be fabricated into devices for use in a variety of different areas including energy (solar cells), displays, (light emitting diodes), and electronics (field effect transistors). During the course of this project, conjugated materials based on the cross-like motif are designed by Tomlinson's team using computational methods in order to identify the most promising candidates for synthesis and characterization by the Jeffries-EL group. This research enhances our understanding of how structure impacts its material properties, and how these properties then impact its performance in various applications. In addition to supporting basic research, this grant provides interdisciplinary research experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students. The broader impacts of this grant include the development of highly qualified scientists with extensive experience working on complex interdisciplinary projects in a diverse environment. Since the University of North Georgia is located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountain range a number of first generation and underrepresented undergraduates are given the opportunity to be involved in this project. Additionally, Dr. Jeffries-EL fosters interest in materials chemistry in underrepresented high school students through the Achievement, Self-Awareness, Communication, Engagement, Networking and Developmental Skills (ASCEND) outreach program targeting low-income and underrepresented minority students in grades 9-12. <br/><br/>The project further advances the field of organic semiconductors through an investigation of structure-property-morphology relationships in cross-conjugated benzobisoxazoles (BBOs). Cross-conjugated molecules, which are systems with two orthogonal conjugation paths that intersect through a central aromatic ring, are especially advantageous for organic semiconducting applications as this arrangement leads to spatial segregation of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). Consequently, it is possible to selectively tune the FMOs and band gaps through aryl group substitution along the various axes as a result of extension of the pi system and inductive effects. The benefits of the approach are that the cross-conjugated platform allows for the opportunity to optimize the material's optical and electronic properties for specific applications. Based on the insights from the previous grant period, there are several opportunities for the rational design of new materials, specifically architectures for narrow band-gap materials for photovoltaic cells and wide band gap materials which can be used as either blue emitters or hosts in organic light emitting diodes. A combination of theory, synthesis, device fabrication and characterization are utilized to identify and generate new materials as well as provide insights on how to design future materials. The simple iterative approach allows for easy synthesis of the target materials and structure-property studies advance the rational design of new materials with characteristics that are tunable and predictable.

Successful methodology developments for all-speed flow simulations will have a broad impact for a wide range of computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-related applications.

The PI seeks to develop a uniform framework to build up high order solvers that could effectively capture shocks without numerical oscillations for the compressible Euler system, and would successfully approximate the incompressible solutions of the system with proper divergence cleaning steps for low Mach flows without the need in resolving acoustic waves. In particular, the main focus would be finite difference schemes with weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstructions coupled with proper implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge Kutta (RK) treatments with the following properties:  (1) the schemes can robustly capture shock fronts in the compressible regime when the Mach number is of order 1; (2) the schemes automatically become high order, stable and consistent solvers for the incompressible Euler system when the Mach number approaches 0; (3) the schemes are high order accurate in both space and in time both when the acoustic waves are well-resolved and are under-resolved. Along this direction, the PI develops a thorough plan in methodology development, stability and asymptotic preserving analysis, as well as extensive benchmarked tests for all-Mach number flows.

Moreover, this research will develop the first generation of downburst fragility models for transmission tower-line systems (TLSs) using experimentally validated numerical models. These fragility models are crucial for risk-informed decision making for design and management of the transmission grid in order to mitigate future failures and enhance the resiliency of the grid against extreme weather events. The numerical and experimental studies will provide the knowledge needed to enhance design methodologies to include downburst wind loads for transmission line systems.  The research findings will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses at Florida International University (FIU) and The Ohio State University to better prepare the future generation of infrastructure engineers. Project data will be archived and publicly shared in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org/). <br/><br/>This research will develop an integrative experimental and numerical framework to characterize the fragility of transmission line systems against downbursts. The experimental research will involve developing a versatile downburst simulator at the NSF-supported NHERI Wall of Wind (WOW) Experimental Facility (EF) at FIU. Using this simulator, a scaled, aeroelastic multi-span TLS will be tested; the results will be used to experimentally validate high-fidelity finite element models of coupled transmission tower-insulator-conductor-foundation systems. Through these experimental and numerical investigations, new knowledge will be gained with regard to the aerodynamic behavior of conductors and drag and shielding effects on lattice tower sections under non-synoptic downburst wind fields. Moreover, these investigations will reveal extreme nonlinear behaviors of transmission line systems in post-elastic regimes when towers are damaged or conductors fail. The research also will provide new physics-based insights into the role of uncertainties in the downburst performance of TLSs. Failure modes that are unique to or are more likely to occur under non-synoptic downburst loadings, as compared to those under synoptic hurricane loadings, will be identified and characterized. The produced data and models will be integrated to develop the first generation of multi-dimensional demand and fragility surfaces for TLSs under downbursts at component- and system-levels using highly efficient and accurate machine learning techniques. In addition, the experimental downburst simulator at the NHERI WOW EF at FIU will provide the natural hazards community with a unique testbed with dual simulation capabilities to generate both non-synoptic and synoptic winds and analyze the impacts on buildings and other structural systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of such systems include how ocean heating influences convective clouds in the tropics, which in turn, can influence severe weather and habitat conditions over North America; or, how a migratory species interacts with its environment and competitive pressures from both predators and prey.   When performing statistical modeling on such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, the scientific goal is typically either inference, prediction, or forecasting, all of which require some measure of uncertainty.  To accomplish these goals through modeling, one must synthesize information from a variety of sources, including direct observations, indirect (remotely sensed) observations, surrogate observations (mechanistic model output), previous empirical results, expert opinion, and scientific knowledge.  This information must then integrate into a process model that can represent the complexity of the interacting processes, and account for uncertainty.  This research is concerned with building these models in a way that can account for complex interactions across different time scales.<br/><br/><br/>This project concerns the development of a methodological framework for parsimonious  and computationally efficient models for multi time-scale nonlinear dynamical spatio-temporal processes that accounts for the interaction across processes and time scales in such a way as to accommodate uncertainty in data, processes, and parameters.  In particular, the project will focus on a hybrid model that combines elements of a generalized quadratic nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamical model with a recurrent neural network model.  However, this methodology will focus on models for processes that involve multiple time scales of variability.  This will include the development of computationally efficient algorithms that can deal with the extreme curse of dimensionality in the state and parameter spaces associated with complex interacting nonlinear phenomena by adapting, extending and combining approaches from both statistics and machine learning. Not only will the proposed modeling and computational methodology be an advancement in statistics, but it will be useful across a broad range of disciplines that deal with complex multi time-scale dynamical processes such as brain science, climatology, demography, econometrics, fisheries, ecology, meteorology, oceanography, and wildlife biology.  In addition, the project will contribute to STEM education through training a graduate research assistant, who will gain inter-disciplinary experience.  In addition, the project will foster undergraduate interest in the STEM disciplines by employing undergraduate research assistants to help with the development of visualization tools for spatio-temporal data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This strongly motivates the need to anticipate event occurrences in advance in order to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. For example, for traffic congestion predictions based on social network reporting and traffic sensors, these methods would inform the authorities where the future congestion will occur and why certain ongoing traffic incident and congestion hot spots will worsen the problem on specific roads. In recent years, such model interpretability has attracted increasing attention as machine learning is beginning to be applied to ever more practical applications. As a domain with significant impact on society, the interpretability of spatio-temporal event forecasting models is particularly important in order to earn the trust of practitioners and become widely adopted in their everyday workflow. However, like conventional machine learning models, models for social event forecasting still primarily focus on prediction accuracy and are rapidly becoming too sophisticated and obscure to be easily understood by human operators. There is thus an urgent need to fill the increasing gap between data scientists and practitioners. To address it, this project focuses on developing a novel spatio-temporal social event forecasting framework that can jointly optimize the model accuracy and interpretability, and automatically illustrate the explanatory process of prediction generation. <br/><br/>To address challenges like spatial dependency and high-dimensional large data, the project aims at exploring the conditional independence and spatial topology to boost the sparsity of spatial dependence patterns. The project will then move on to exploit the hierarchical conjunction lattice of primitive data features to enforce the conciseness and sparsity of expository high-level representations of the data. To solve the formulated optimization problem for jointly maximizing accuracy and interpretability, this project also involves research on the corresponding optimization methods with rigorous theoretical analysis on efficiency and optimality. Finally, strategies for evaluating model interpretability in social event forecasting are systematically investigated. The success of this project will shed a light on the generic research in interpretable data mining and machine learning. The methods and tools developed in this project will help fill the gaps between data scientists and domain-specific forecasting experts. Finally, this project will provide valuable resources to support courses with new topics, datasets, techniques, and software, and gives more research opportunities for underrepresented students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, those advanced EM models have not been fully exploited by existing EM-aware physical design and optimization methods to reduce and mitigate the overly conservative VLSI design practices. The new EM models can naturally consider wire topology and structure impacts on the EM failures of interconnect wires and recovery effects of EM aging process for the first time, thus opening new opportunities for EM optimization at physical design stages.

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The three-year project, Montana Models: Connecting Local and Disciplinary Practices through University-Community Partnerships, focuses on creating, implementing, and studying several learning outcomes associated with youth engagement in mathematical modeling contexts. The project builds on existing partnerships between the state's two research universities and Montana 4-H to target outreach to rural youth and bring them into a network of people who can inspire, support, and sustain STEM learning. Middle school and high school students from rural communities will be invited to a university campus for a residential modeling-based summer program l focused on mathematics and mathematical modeling. Activities at the summer program are designed to engage them in problems relevant to their own backgrounds and experiences and to honor their local funds of knowledge. <br/><br/>The primary goal of Montana Models is to use mathematical modeling as a mechanism for bringing everyday mathematical practices already present in rural communities into contact with disciplinary practices. The project focuses on the following research questions: (1) What are the everyday mathematical practices in Montana communities? (2) How can everyday mathematical practices be leveraged and brought into contact with disciplinary practices in service of mathematizing meaningful questions within the community? (3) How do youth identify and get identified with respect to mathematics and with respect to their role in the world? (4) How does participation in project activities affect participants' knowledge of mathematical practices and content? The project uses social design experimentation, a hybrid research methodology which combines the traditions of design-based research with forms of inquiry that involve collaboration among participants, researchers, and other stakeholders, such as critical ethnography. Data sources include field notes from ethnographic observations, interviews, videos of students engaging in modeling activities, artifacts that show their  mathematical work, and results from the Attitudes Towards Mathematics Inventory. Through its collaboration with 4-H, Montana Models targets outreach to rural youth across the state, especially those from groups that are typically underrepresented in STEM fields. The project is poised to impact ways in which formal and informal educators understand the knowledge bases that are already present in rural communities and how those bases may inform, support, and sustain STEM learning. Findings and deliverables will be disseminated through a public-facing website and through the 4-H infrastructure. This infrastructure includes Montana 4-H's Clover Communication Contest that will allow participating youth to showcase their projects.

These molecules have unique properties that have long been of interest for the development of new therapeutic and imaging agents for medicinal applications, new catalysts for industrially-important chemical reactions, and new advanced optical and electronic materials. Yet in spite of this interest, the molecules have seen limited use. This is in large part because of a lack of synthetic methods that allow for their preparation. The goal of the research being pursued by Professor Juhasz and his group is to solve this problem. Accordingly, they are working to develop efficient approaches for the preparation of new boron clusters. In addition to these scientific goals, the reactions being developed provide excellent opportunities to educate science students in the subfields of organic and inorganic chemistry. The chemistry has the potential for high impact, and it is accessible to the undergraduates who are driving the effort.

The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop new synthetic methods for preparing useful derivatives of CB11, by pursuing three specific synthetic aims. Aim 1 is introducing ester and amide functional groups at boron vertices employing a two-step synthesis with a carboxylic acid intermediate to attach amides and esters to boron atoms in the CB11 cage. Aim 2 is expanding an existing cyanation strategy (through optimization of the catalyst, solvent, and microwave-irradiation parameters) to prepare highly cyanated CB11 clusters. Aim 3 is developing a versatile method for introducing alkyl and aryl substituents via an adapted Suzuki coupling reaction. The proposed is preparing potentially useful derivatives of CB11 carborane clusters.

Adapting these processes to the ""greenest"" solvent - water - remains a challenge. This project to be conducted by Professor Julius Rebek at The Scripps Research Institute uses synthetic, container-shape, molecules for reactions in water. The ""containers"" act as nanovessels that show robust stability and can be used and re-used over a wide range of conditions. A broader impact of this research is the benefit of developing sustainable chemistry.  Another impact is the discovery of new molecules for use in water-proof coatings and nanomachines.  Postdoctoral researchers benefit from learning how research projects translate from chemical discovery to applications in new materials.<br/><br/>The chemistry of molecules confined to small containers - nanoscale compounds known as cavitands - is a relatively new undertaking. This research takes advantage of an early discovery that long-chain organic compounds assume unusual, folded shapes within the cavitand's space. The folded shapes, induced by hydrophobic forces, push the substrate's ends together and promote large-ring cyclization processes. The cavitands act as templates. Folding also blocks some sites on the chain and exposes others to reactions with agents in the aqueous medium. The blocking action promises new chemical pathways for remote carbon-hydrogen activation in functionalization reactions that typically lead to 5 or 6-membered ring sizes. Functional groups that are remote in extended molecules are brought into proximity when folded in cavitands. The functions no longer act independently and can affect each other's reactivity; showing the consequences of this ""entanglement"" is one of the basic science novelties expected from this research. The practical consequences may include synthetic methods for access to molecules that cannot be made by conventional means.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study, known as BATS, has been running continuously since 1988. The research goals of the BATS program are: (1) to improve our understanding of the time-varying components of the ocean carbon cycle and the cycles of related nutrient elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon; and, (2) to identify the relevant physical, chemical and ecosystem properties responsible for this variability. In addition, the BATS program has strong and diverse broader impacts, contributing to the field of ocean sciences by providing high quality ocean observations and data for seagoing scientists and modelers, and a framework through which researchers can conceive and test hypotheses. This award will support the operations of the BATS program for five more years.<br/><br/>The primary BATS research themes are as follows: (1) Quantify the role of ocean-atmosphere coupling and climate variability on air-sea exchange of CO2, and carbon export to the ocean interior; (2) Document trends and the controls on the interannual to decadal scale variability in carbon and nutrient cycles to their coupling in the surface and deep ocean via the Redfield Ratio paradigm; (3) Quantify the response of planktonic community structure and function, and impact on biogeochemical cycles to variability in surface fluxes and dynamical processes; (4) Facilitate development, calibration and validation of next generation oceanographic sensors, tools and technologies; and, (5) Generate a dataset that can be utilized by empiricists, modelers and students. This research integrates ocean physics, chemistry and biology into a framework for understanding oceanic processes and ocean change in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. The existing 29 years of BATS data provide robust constraints on seasonal and interannual variability, the response of the Sargasso Sea ecosystem to natural climate variability, and signal detection of potential ocean changes. This project would extend the BATS program through years 31-35 to address a series of ten interlinked questions through integrated research approaches and a multitude of collaborative efforts. In addition to the themes above, and embedded into the ten questions and approaches, the BATS team will focus on, for example, coupling of particle production and biogeochemistry; revisiting the complexities of the biological carbon pump; oxygen decline; and changes in the hydrography, physics, ocean carbon cycle and biogeochemistry of the Sargasso Sea. The highest quality data observation and collection will be maintained and used to address these questions. Importantly, a wide range of collaborations at the BATS site, spanning the physical and biogeochemical disciplines, will aid these broad goals. Strong links to community stakeholders, and close collaboration (including methods intercomparisons and personnel exchanges) with the Hawaii Ocean Time-series are proposed.

The downside is that it requires a full model for the observables as well as all unknown quantities, the specification of which can be a burden on the data analyst. In addition to the familiar challenges of prior specification, there are also risks of misspecification biases. A more subtle complication is due to selection effects that result from considering several candidate models.  The data analyst's burden is further exaggerated in situations where only a feature of the unknowns is of interest, i.e., when there is an interest parameter and a (potentially high-dimensional) nuisance parameter and inference is required only for the former.  That is, the Bayesian approach still requires that the data analyst make non-trivial efforts to specify prior distributions and carry out posterior computations relevant only to the nuisance parameter, which can be viewed as a waste.  Yet having access to a posterior distribution for inference on the interest parameter is still a desirable feature, and the proposed research aims to develop a new framework for posterior inference directly on interest parameters.  These direct posteriors (DiPs) effectively target the interest parameter, giving data analysts an opportunity to avoid the seemingly wasteful modeling and computation efforts involving nuisance parameters.

Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups. The methods to be developed will recognize the cases when the data is well clustered and, in these cases, will provide a ""certificate of stability"" guaranteeing this. This research will develop validation methods for several widely used clustering paradigms (such as K-means, Spectral Clustering, finite Mixture Models) in realistic data scenarios. These methods will be integrated and disseminated with the big data open source platform megaman, developed and maintained by the group of PI Meila.<br/><br/>The proposed approach is based on the notions of good and stable clustering. ``Good'' means that clustering C fits the data well, according to the current clustering paradigm. ``Stable'' means that the only clusterings that fit well are small perturbations of C. This can only happen when C captures structure present in the data. While goodness can be easily checked in practice, stability is not a property that can be verified directly. The core of this project is to find conditions on the data and C that guarantee stability AND are practically verifyable. Such results are known as stability results. The project outlines two novel approaches to this goal. The first approach is based on using convex relaxations to the original clustering problem. The second approach is based on ``recycling'' existing theoretical results proved under assumptions about the data generating model. Often, the proof of such a result contains the elements of a model free stability proof. Thus, this project will be using existing statistical theory in a novel way. Among convex relaxations for clustering, the relaxations to a Semi-Definite Program (SDP) are especially promising. Therefore, ways to accelerate the validation algorithms by exploiting the special structure of the SDPs will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These complex materials are of technological importance as they can be fabricated into devices for use in a variety of different areas including energy (solar cells), displays, (light emitting diodes), and electronics (field effect transistors). During the course of this project, conjugated materials based on the cross-like motif are designed by Tomlinson's team using computational methods in order to identify the most promising candidates for synthesis and characterization by the Jeffries-EL group. This research enhances our understanding of how structure impacts its material properties, and how these properties then impact its performance in various applications. In addition to supporting basic research, this grant provides interdisciplinary research experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students.  The broader impacts of this grant include the development of highly qualified scientists with extensive experience working on complex interdisciplinary projects in a diverse environment. Since the University of North Georgia is located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountain range a number of first generation and underrepresented undergraduates are given the opportunity to be involved in this project.  Additionally, Dr. Jeffries-EL fosters interest in materials chemistry in underrepresented high school students through the Achievement, Self-Awareness, Communication, Engagement, Networking and Developmental Skills (ASCEND) outreach program targeting low-income and underrepresented minority students in grades 9-12.   <br/><br/>The project further advances the field of organic semiconductors through an investigation of structure-property-morphology relationships in cross-conjugated benzobisoxazoles (BBOs). Cross-conjugated molecules, which are systems with two orthogonal conjugation paths that intersect through a central aromatic ring, are especially advantageous for organic semiconducting applications as this arrangement leads to spatial segregation of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). Consequently, it is possible to selectively tune the FMOs and band gaps through aryl group substitution along the various axes as a result of extension of the pi system and inductive effects. The benefits of the approach are that the cross-conjugated platform allows for the opportunity to optimize the material's optical and electronic properties for specific applications. Based on the insights from the previous grant period, there are several opportunities for the rational design of new materials, specifically architectures for narrow band-gap materials for photovoltaic cells and wide band gap materials which can be used as either blue emitters or hosts in organic light emitting diodes.  A combination of theory, synthesis, device fabrication and characterization are utilized to identify and generate new materials as well as provide insights on how to design future materials. The simple iterative approach allows for easy synthesis of the target materials and structure-property studies advance the rational design of new materials with characteristics that are tunable and predictable.

Many of these flows involve atomizing a liquid into small-scale drops forming a spray. The performance of the overall system depends strongly on the quality of this spray. For example, in aircraft or internal combustion engines improvements in the quality of the spray can result in efficiency gains and reduction in pollutant production. In medical sprays, precisely controlling the spray drop sizes of aerosols can significantly improve the delivery of pharmaceuticals into the lung. Unfortunately, no efficient model derived from first principle currently exists that can predict and simulate the complex process of spray formation in turbulent flows. Thus an incremental design improvement philosophy is prevalent in many applications because experiments of radically new designs are very costly and numerical simulations lack a predictive model for turbulent atomization processes and thus require tuning with existing experimental data. The goal of this project is to develop an efficient predictive model to simulate atomization processes in turbulent flows. Such a model has the potential to initiate a bold new design philosophy that targets radically new designs because the cost of pre-selection feasibility studies using the new model would be significantly lower than experimental studies. The project also incorporates significant educational activities, including involvement of undergraduate researchers and outreach targeting local Title-One schools through on-campus activities and off-campus classroom visits.<br/><br/>The new model is based on the idea of a dual scale approach, circumventing the limitations of classical modeling approaches for turbulent flows that rely on the existence of a cascade process from large to small scales. Such a cascade is likely not dominant for atomizing phase interfaces since surface tension forces that are dominant on the small scale can both generate and annihilate small scale interface structures. The proposed dual scale approach takes this into account by employing a multi-scale decomposition that combines features of direct numerical simulations resolving the small scales with large eddy simulation for the larger scales in an efficient way. This approach inherently incorporates the interaction and competition between different forces and atomization mechanisms acting on multiple length and time scales and enables the explicit closure of terms requiring modeling on the larger scales by applying explicit filters to the resolved scale phase interface geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motivation arises from the need to understand the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks to inform the design of novel synthetic biocircuits. In many cases, the essential function of such a network involves rare events -- be they transitions between metastable states or sudden bursts of activity. Since proteins serve as regulators, transcriptional delay (the time from transcription initiation to the formation of functional protein) is intrinsic to genetic regulatory networks and has been shown to dramatically affect network dynamics. Mathematically, large deviations theories allow for rare event quantification. What is the most likely transition pathway between one metastable state and another? How often do rare events occur? Large deviations theories can answer such questions, both theoretically and computationally. This project aims to develop a comprehensive theoretical and computational large deviations framework for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with delay, particularly the nonlinear delay stochastic differential equations that model genetic regulatory networks. Synthetic biologists have recently focused on building genetic regulatory networks within synthetic microbial consortia. This distributed approach offers modularity and the potential to build ever more complex biocircuits. However, the resultant dynamics are quite complex, as consortia feature spatiotemporal dynamics, cell cycle effects, chemical signaling, population-level effects, and mechano-sensing. This project aims to build a large deviations theory for spatiotemporal delay systems, including microbial consortia.

Professors Aaron Timperman from the University of Illinois and Boyd Edwards from Utah State University are investigating the fundamental mechanisms of a new separation method called microfluidic traveling-wave electrophoresis (TWE). TWE is a promising method for reducing the complexity of samples that may come from biological organisms or the environment. In the investigation of the mechanisms of TWE, the team is determining precisely how TWE works and on optimizing its performance. The unique characteristics of TWE separations make it well-suited for applications that cannot be achieved with other separation methods. The TWE separation is driven with very low voltages (+/-0.5 V) which are 1,000 to 10,000 times smaller than its nearest relative, microchannel electrophoresis. This low voltage requirement makes TWE highly compatible with fieldable sensing systems. TWE should prove helpful in applications such as detection of biomarkers in human medical, forensic, and drug testing, detection of toxic substances in the environment, and detection of threat agents for homeland defense. The team collaborates with the Illinois Academic Ambassadors to enhance exposure of middle school and high school students to STEM research.<br/>A combined experimental and theoretical modeling approach is used to provide a thorough and quantitative description of the mechanisms of TWE. TWE is distinct as a low frequency AC electrophoretic separation in which a longitudinal electric field wave propagates through the microfluidic channel. The separation mechanisms of TWE are unique: TWE can rapidly switch between separative transport, non-separative transport, and immobilization simply by changing the frequency of the traveling wave; and both anions and cations move in the same direction. The goal of this work is to fully understand and quantitatively describe the fundamental mechanisms of traveling wave electrophoresis. The objectives are: 1) determining the mechanisms of zone migration, 2) determining the mechanisms of zone dispersion, and 3) defining the fundamental equations of separation efficiency, resolution, and peak capacity. The experimental results guide the development of the theoretical models, and the fundamental equations derived are experimentally verified. These fundamental equations provide a basis with which this separation method can be quantitatively compared with others and inform optimal device design.

The framework will provide knowledge that can help reduce outage-induced societal disruptions caused by downbursts, and thus enable continued national prosperity and welfare following a downburst event. Using this framework, various significant factors for the downburst performance of transmission systems and potential causes of past failures will be investigated. Moreover, this research will develop the first generation of downburst fragility models for transmission tower-line systems (TLSs) using experimentally validated numerical models. These fragility models are crucial for risk-informed decision making for design and management of the transmission grid in order to mitigate future failures and enhance the resiliency of the grid against extreme weather events. The numerical and experimental studies will provide the knowledge needed to enhance design methodologies to include downburst wind loads for transmission line systems.  The research findings will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses at Florida International University (FIU) and The Ohio State University to better prepare the future generation of infrastructure engineers. Project data will be archived and publicly shared in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org/). <br/><br/>This research will develop an integrative experimental and numerical framework to characterize the fragility of transmission line systems against downbursts. The experimental research will involve developing a versatile downburst simulator at the NSF-supported NHERI Wall of Wind (WOW) Experimental Facility (EF) at FIU. Using this simulator, a scaled, aeroelastic multi-span TLS will be tested; the results will be used to experimentally validate high-fidelity finite element models of coupled transmission tower-insulator-conductor-foundation systems. Through these experimental and numerical investigations, new knowledge will be gained with regard to the aerodynamic behavior of conductors and drag and shielding effects on lattice tower sections under non-synoptic downburst wind fields. Moreover, these investigations will reveal extreme nonlinear behaviors of transmission line systems in post-elastic regimes when towers are damaged or conductors fail. The research also will provide new physics-based insights into the role of uncertainties in the downburst performance of TLSs. Failure modes that are unique to or are more likely to occur under non-synoptic downburst loadings, as compared to those under synoptic hurricane loadings, will be identified and characterized. The produced data and models will be integrated to develop the first generation of multi-dimensional demand and fragility surfaces for TLSs under downbursts at component- and system-levels using highly efficient and accurate machine learning techniques. In addition, the experimental downburst simulator at the NHERI WOW EF at FIU will provide the natural hazards community with a unique testbed with dual simulation capabilities to generate both non-synoptic and synoptic winds and analyze the impacts on buildings and other structural systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many modern electronic devices, which range from medical diagnostics and therapeutics instruments, to high-resolution optical displays and flexible electronics, rely on quantum-confined nanostructures. However, realization of their full potential requires a fundamental understanding of their interactions with light. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kenneth Knappenberger from Pennsylvania State University (PSU) is developing advanced magneto-optical measurement capabilities to probe quantum-confined structures.  Professor Knappenberger and his students are using the unique capabilities of this instrument to understand the behavior of electrons in transition metal dicholcogenide (TMD) materials, and how they interact with vibrations in the crystal lattice.  The insights gained from the work could impact existing optoelectronic and photonic technologies, as well as emerging quantum information and sensing applications. The project is also providing training opportunities for future scientists in advanced experimental techniques.  As part of this project, Professor Knappenberger has established a local student section of the Optical Society of America at Penn State. This activity facilitates a weekly brown-bag optics club lunch, hosted in the Millennium Science Complex at PSU. Students are able to present their research progress in an informal setting that includes faculty, postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students. The program also includes a component for a high school volunteer student. This student acquires skills in data analysis and processing.   <br/><br/>The research team is developing and using novel variable-temperature, variable-magnetic field (VTVH) spectroscopy methods to characterize the electronic structure of a series of two-dimensionally confined quantum materials, including multi-component structures featuring combinations of 0-D/1-D/2-D systems. The overall objective is to understand how electronic carrier coupling to low-frequency phonon modes affects the relaxation dynamics of these systems. In order to achieve this fundamental research goal, the team is developing VTVH ultrafast two-dimensional spectroscopy (VTVH-2DES) capabilities, and using them to characterize key parameters of transient exciton states, such as Lande g factors, zero-field splitting energies, and electron-phonon coupling strengths. Monitoring transient signal amplitudes from these excitons in the time- and energy-domains provides insight into phonon-mediated energy relaxation and transfer in quantum materials. The research activities include 1) understanding the optical properties and electronic structure for single and multi-layer 2-D confined TMDs, 2) development of VTVH-2DES infrastructure of characterizing TMD transient states, 3) quantitatively describing quantum-state-specific electron-phonon coupling and carrier dynamics for TMDs; and 4) understanding fundamental mechanisms of phonon-mediated energy transfer in multi-component quantum structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Appreciable advances have been made in recent years in the design of new molecular switches, integrating them into bulk materials, and applying them in new functions. However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed before such systems can find their way into real-life applications. This research addresses one of these issues, which is the lack of a basic understanding of how to make molecular switches and machines work together towards a useful goal - a solved problem in natural biological systems. To mimic Nature, the Aprahamian research group at Dartmouth College studies the interactions of molecular switches with their environment. This knowledge may lead to the engineering of dynamic, adaptive and self-regulating molecular assemblies that can be used in drug delivery and energy-related applications. The broader impacts of this research include participation in the American Chemical Society's SEED Program and other endeavors to help retain students at different levels of education (high school, undergraduate, and graduate students) in the sciences.  Professor Aprahamian also uses interactive demonstrations to educate the public about important concepts related to supramolecular chemistry.

The Aprahamian group gains a deeper understanding of the factors that control CCD-enabled negative feedback loops and uncovers the underlying rules that lead to analyte regulation. Finally, the group develops new zinc(II) photocages/switches that can couple with CCD and feedback loops to enable the future design of oscillating systems, molecular clocks, and self-regulating assemblies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professors Aaron Timperman from the University of Illinois and Boyd Edwards from Utah State University are investigating the fundamental mechanisms of a new separation method called microfluidic traveling-wave electrophoresis (TWE). TWE is a promising method for reducing the complexity of samples that may come from biological organisms or the environment. In the investigation of the mechanisms of TWE, the team is determining precisely how TWE works and on optimizing its performance. The unique characteristics of TWE separations make it well-suited for applications that cannot be achieved with other separation methods. The TWE separation is driven with very low voltages (+/-0.5 V) which are 1,000 to 10,000 times smaller than its nearest relative, microchannel electrophoresis. This low voltage requirement makes TWE highly compatible with fieldable sensing systems. TWE should prove helpful in applications such as detection of biomarkers in human medical, forensic, and drug testing, detection of toxic substances in the environment, and detection of threat agents for homeland defense. The team collaborates with the Illinois Academic Ambassadors to enhance exposure of middle school and high school students to STEM research.<br/><br/>A combined experimental and theoretical modeling approach is used to provide a thorough and quantitative description of the mechanisms of TWE. TWE is distinct as a low frequency AC electrophoretic separation in which a longitudinal electric field wave propagates through the microfluidic channel. The separation mechanisms of TWE are unique: TWE can rapidly switch between separative transport, non-separative transport, and immobilization simply by changing the frequency of the traveling wave; and both anions and cations move in the same direction. The goal of this work is to fully understand and quantitatively describe the fundamental mechanisms of traveling wave electrophoresis. The objectives are: 1) determining the mechanisms of zone migration, 2) determining the mechanisms of zone dispersion, and 3) defining the fundamental equations of separation efficiency, resolution, and peak capacity. The experimental results guide the development of the theoretical models, and the fundamental equations derived are experimentally verified. These fundamental equations provide a basis with which this separation method can be quantitatively compared with others and inform optimal device design. The experimental team includes both undergraduate and graduate students. This is an interdisciplinary project that exposes students to separations, theoretical modeling, and fabrication in Engineering. An outreach component is included that impacts middle and high school students, exposing them to STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photonic solutions are particularly suited to enable these services due to the advantages of light such as multi-terabit bandwidths, low-loss propagation over kilometers, and low cross-talk. In fact, some internet provides have begun providing service entirely through light (fiber optics). As a result, the advancement of photonic telecommunications technologies will have a profound impact upon our nation by providing improved performance of internet-based services, reduced energy consumption, and a lower cost of construction/operation for networks. Current photonic modulators, small switches which convert electrical signals into optical pulses, are limited in their speed due to the weak interaction of light and matter. More recently, metals have been utilized to enhance this interaction, facilitating a reduction of device size and increase of speed. Yet, these devices struggle to achieve efficient transmission ~10%, which is simply insufficient for many applications. Here, we look utilize the benefits of both approaches by allowing the lossy metallic nature to be engaged and disengaged when desired. This approach limits the loss of the structure while still maintaining the benefits of metal plasmonic structures. By partnering with existing programs at the home university, the research will provide avenues for local high school students, teachers, and undergraduates to learn about impact of light-based technologies on our society while providing a platform to train a highly skilled workforce. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Despite significant research in the areas of photonic and plasmonic-based approaches, there is yet to be a device which achieves efficient all-around performance (modulation strength, insertion loss, energy consumption, size, and speed). Photonic approaches suffer from poor light-matter interactions, requiring speed restricting resonators and long interaction lengths, while plasmonic approaches have yet to overcome the large insertion loss associated with their metallic components. This proposal seeks to solve this dilemma through a new design approach in which plasmonic elements are disengaged in the off- (transmissive) state to minimize insertion loss, yet are engaged in the on-state to achieve large modulation in a short distance. This is achieved through a specifically chosen set of oxide layers which appear dielectric to the optical mode under no electrical bias, yet can be modulated into an epsilon-near-zero condition (effectively engaging the plasmonic nature) to achieve efficient modulation through free-carrier accumulation and depletion. It is shown that this approach is able to produce the first modulator design capable of efficient all-around performance: area of 3 square microns, 1.5 dB, 9dB extinction ratio, 12 fJ/bit energy consumption, and 112 GHz bandwidth. Although it is impactful for integrated systems, the approach is general and may also find applications in related areas such as metamaterials and sensors. Additionally, the realization of the device will demonstrate that plasmonic systems are not synonymous with loss and the benefits of such systems (confinement, enhanced light-matter-interaction) can be employed without detrimental loss.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project uses computational modeling at multiple scales to elucidate how a class of molecular machines associated with microtubules accomplishes the severing of this largest structure in the cytoskeleton, whose dynamic organization and rearrangement is an essential process of cell division, motility, and development. This research will address a critical gap in our understanding of the dynamic properties of microtubules and their complexes with microtubule associated proteins undergoing wear and their dependence on the magnitude and geometry of mechanical input and will lead to a better understanding of how molecular machines work. The project will provide education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in computational biophysical chemistry by involving them in interdisciplinary scientific projects and increase the participation of groups underrepresented in science through the outreach at local Cincinnati Public School and through research experience opportunities for freshmen students participating in the ""Women in Science and Engineering"" program at the University of Cincinnati.

Unlike ionic solids (such as table salt, Na+ Cl-), the fluid form of ionic liquids (also called molten salts) makes them potentially useful for a variety of technological applications, such as batteries, fuel cells and the solvents for the synthesis of other molecules.  Just as liquid water actually contains areas that are ice-like in their ordering, ionic liquids can also possess local ordering of ionic molecules.  The extent of ordering in ionic liquids influences their physical properties (e.g., density, viscosity, ability to conduct electricity).  Professor Sangoro and his team seek to understand how ions organize in the liquid state, how long the arrangements persists, and how these arrangements are changed by interfaces such as the ionic liquid-air interface, or the interface between the liquid and a metal surface(where the metal may be a catalyst or an electrode for chemical reactions). The Sangoro group uses x-ray and neutron scattering techniques and a technique called broadband dielectric spectroscopy to obtain information about the structure and behavior of ionic liquids. This information may aid in the development of new clean energy and battery technologies.  The main goal of the educational and outreach plans is to increase student interest in, exposure to, and preparation for careers in science and engineering, with specific focus on minority students. Professor Sangoro organizes mentored research experiences for high school students from underrepresented/minority and economically disadvantaged local groups, by first introducing engineering undergraduate students to research within the first two years of college.  The research group partners with established NSF-funded outreach programs at the University of Tennessee to attract and retain engineering students from underrepresented groups, providing new research and training opportunities to graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in order to provide state-of-the-art research opportunities.  Professor Sangoro engages in individualized mentoring for selected K-12 students from underrepresented groups in the economically disadvantaged groups living in the East Knoxville area. This CAREER grant enables the research team to provide hands-on training to both graduate and undergraduate students as well as high school students who may go on to become future scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The project focuses on understanding the impact of mesoscale organization on interfacial ion dynamics in bulk and confined molecular ionic liquids. Upon systematic variation of the chemical composition of ionic liquids, the mesoscale organization and dynamics are probed by x-ray and neutron scattering, dynamic mechanical spectroscopy, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy. These complementary techniques enable the correlation of mesoscale structures, and an understanding of their dynamics and the resulting physical and chemical properties of ionic liquids. The second emphasis of this research project is on elucidating the correlation between of mesoscale organization and dynamics within the electrochemical double layers in molecular ionic liquids. This effort involves development of a new theoretical model to describe the processes associated with accumulation of ions at interfaces between ions and solid electron conductors. The third thrust of the project focuses on experiments to understand the impact of geometric confinement on mesoscale organization and dynamics. To achieve this, silica nanopores with mean diameters as small as 4 nanometers are prepared through electrochemical etching and filled with systematic series of ionic liquids. The interactions between ionic liquids and the pore walls are intentionally varied while measuring the dynamics associated with the ions. The series of experiments and computations leads to a molecular-level understanding of the influence of mesoscopic organization on interfacial ion dynamics and transport in bulk and confined molecular ionic liquids. The fundamental understanding gained from these studies enables rational development of more efficient systems of ionic liquids for different applications including uses in electrochemical power sources and devices. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from an increased understanding of ionic liquids, as well as training of students and postdoctoral associates in fundamental science underlying many electrochemical energy technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there is still very little understanding how to grow thin film single crystals that could help lead to the highest potential for this class of material.

Employing vapor growth, the researchers explore and uncover heteroepitaxial growth modes of perovskite films that also enable the fabrication of quantum confined multilayers using real-time and in-situ diffraction techniques optimized for growth on both insulating and semiconducting substrates. Routes to tailoring the crystalline phase, stoichiometry, strain, and doping profiles of epitaxial films and quantum wells are established to realize electronic many-body phases in high-quality two-dimensional electron systems and determine the connection between structure and quantum properties that can guide future device development.

With this award, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the principle investigator synthesizes novel n-type organic semiconductors that are good candidates for spin-based computing technologies. Due to their strong spin-dependent properties they are efficient spin-transistor materials. Additionally, the researchers investigate, if waste heat from a device may also be converted into spin currents thus increasing the overall efficiency of spin-transistor devices. An innovative education and outreach program, which includes bi-weekly hands-on research experiences related to energy conversion and storage into the science curriculum of a local urban high-need school in the Salt Lake City area, is part of this research project. Additionally, underprivileged students from local high-schools are given the opportunity to pursue research over the summer in the principle investigator's labs.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>Recent advances in the field of organic electronics have demonstrated that the physical and chemical properties of organic semiconductors can be vastly improved by tuning the molecular arrangement of the sp2 hybridized backbone system or by oxidatively doping the organic molecule to form either a p-type or n-type semiconductor. Although p-type organic semiconductors have been largely explored as potential thermoelectric and spintronic materials, n-type organic semiconductors have fallen behind due to their low electron affinities. As part of this award, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the principle investigator synthesizes novel n-type organic semiconductors based on the thionation of perylene diimides.  Additionally, fundamental mechanistic understanding of the influence of electronic structure, morphology, intrinsic and extrinsic doping, and spins on the thermoelectric and spintronic properties of these perylene diimide n-type organic semiconductors is being elucidated. The studies investigate new breakthroughs in both materials design and modulation of fundamental physical phenomena by carefully elucidating the role of spin-orbit coupling, electron-phonon coupling, and solid-state crystal chemistry on the performance of thionated perylene diimide thermoelectric and spintronic materials. An innovative education and outreach program, which includes bi-weekly hands-on research experiences related to energy conversion and storage into the science curriculum of a local urban high-need school in the Salt Lake City area, is part of this research project. Additionally, underprivileged students from local high schools are given the opportunity to pursue research over the summer in the principle investigator's labs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among all spaces, the spheres are the most fundamental and beautiful objects. A central question in homotopy theory and algebraic topology - the computation of homotopy groups of spheres - is to understand how spheres can be mapped to other spheres, in different dimensions, and to understand how different maps can or cannot be deformed to each other. This topological question is not just a fundamental question on fundamental mathematical objects, but it also has deep connections and interactions to other subjects in mathematics. It has been a major research question since 1950's. For example, Kervaire and Milnor established a connection to the question on how many ways one could do calculus on spheres - smooth structures on spheres; Kervaire and Browder built a connection to the question on how one could or could not do surgeries to higher dimensional spaces to turn them into spheres - the Kervaire invariant problem. Moreover, a summand of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, the image of J, is closely related to the Bernoulli numbers; Quillen and Goerss, Hopkins, Miller, Lurie established a connection to the moduli stack of formal groups. More recently, Hill, Hopkins, Ravenel, Voevodsky, Morel, Isaksen and others established connections between equivariant homotopy theory and motivic homotopy theory. The goal of this project is to deepen the existing connections, as well as discovering new connections by pushing further the limit of existing ones.<br/><br/><br/>This research concentrates on computations of stable homotopy groups of spheres, with interactions among motivic, equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory, and applications to problems in differential topology, such as uniqueness of smooth structure on spheres and the Kervaire invariant problem. More specifically, in current and ongoing projects with Isaksen and Wang, the Principle Investigator (PI) develops new computational tools in motivic homotopy theory, with connection to chromatic homotopy theory, which computes 40 more new stems of classical stable homotopy groups of sphere within two years. The PI will deepen the new connection between motivic homotopy theory and chromatic homotopy theory, carry out more computations of stable stems in the next a few years, and use the computations to attack the last unsolved case of the Kervaire invariant problem in dimension 126. The PI will also explore connections between real motivic homotopy theory and C2 equivariant homotopy theory, following ongoing work of Behrens, Dugger, Guillou and Isaksen. The goal is to prove structural theorems in this direction, as well as providing concrete computational results. In ongoing projects with Hill, Shi and Wang, the PI will also apply equivariant techniques, such as the slice spectral sequences that are developed by Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, to do computations in heights greater than 2 in chromatic homotopy theory and to understand its connection to stable homotopy groups of spheres.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These functions, in turn, are closely associated with the root architecture. Quantifying root architecture is not only a fundamental aspect of plant science but is a critical component in crop breeding for sustainable agriculture. Recent advances in 3D imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) have made it possible to capture 3D root structures in natural growing environments and monitor their growth over time. Unfortunately, the potential of the imaging techniques has been largely held back by the lack of effective computational tools for interpreting the images and distilling biological insights. This project, to be conducted by a group of computer scientists, mathematicians, and biologists across three institutes in the St. Louis region, aims at developing efficient and robust computational methods for automated analysis of root architecture from 3D images. The research looks a step ahead of the current cutting edge phenotype data collection, to how we will derive accurate representations of growing root systems, and therefore gain insight into the plant phenome. The team is committed to providing training to more than ten students over the course of the project, leveraging the existing NSF REU programs at two of the institutes. The team will pursue outreach activities not only within the research communities but also locally in the St. Louis area with a focus on grade schools.<br/><br/>Deriving root architecture from 3D images involves a number of technically challenging tasks, including inferring individual roots from a segmented image, reconstructing their branching structure, and tracking the architecture in a time series of segmented images. This research draws from, and extends upon, methods from computer graphics and computational geometry to address these tasks. Specifically, the research will develop three novel classes of methods. Given a noise-ridden root segmentation, the first class of methods produces a curve skeleton that captures the topology and branching structure of the root system. The second class then uses the curve skeleton to automatically infer architectural components such as the root hierarchy and types. The third class improves the accuracy of the algorithms in the 1rst two classes by utilizing a sequence of segmentations and further annotates the root architecture with a time function. These algorithms enable the extraction of detailed root traits for root phenotyping, and both the algorithms and traits will be evaluated by a suite of representative real-world imaging data.<br/>Besides the design of automatic algorithms, a graphical software will be prototyped that offers fast and interactive means to inspect and edit the results produced by the algorithms. The software will be tested by biologists in the team and freely distributed to the research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The particles impart function, such as conductivity needed to transport electrons through 3-D printed wires. The polymers are added to control the flow behavior of the mixture. Tuning the properties of these mixtures requires controlling the distribution of the particles -- conductivity, for example, requires the particles to form a connected network. One factor that affects particle distribution during flow is shear-induced migration, in which particles migrate away from the walls and accumulate near the center of a narrow channel. This project will use experiments to determine the effect of polymers in solution on the distribution of particles as they flow through narrow channels. This knowledge will provide new routes to control the structure and functional properties of particulate suspensions for applications in next-generation energy storage and transport.<br/><br/>Suspensions of microscale particles in complex fluids offer transformative opportunities in materials engineering for energy storage and transport. Miniaturizing these technologies requires increasing the suspension conductivity, by ensuring particle connectivity, while minimizing clogging in small channels. Complex fluid additives such as polymers or surfactants needed for suspension function or stability, however, may alter particle connectivity and density. Hence controlling particle density in the presence of additives is essential for attaining the desired functional properties of confined particulate suspensions. Polymers added to particulate suspensions may alter shear-induced migration, one mechanism that generates non-uniform density profiles in confined flows, in at least two ways: by generating aggregates or by enhancing normal stresses. Systematic understanding of how to control microscale particle migration in polymer solutions is currently lacking. The objective of this project is to understand how polymers alter shear-induced migration of colloidal particles during microchannel flow. To test the hypothesis that the extent of migration reflects competition between polymer-enhanced normal stresses and polymer-driven migration, the PI will use bulk rheology and microchannel confocal imaging experiments to characterize the normal stresses and particle microstructure in strongly and weakly migrating suspensions containing either adsorbing or non-adsorbing polymers. Measurements of particle velocity and concentration profiles will be compared to existing theoretical models for shear-induced migration of hard-sphere particles in simple liquids. This plan of work will identify the relative impact of the two competing mechanisms on shear-induced migration, leading to unprecedented control over particle density in models of technologically important materials and allowing existing models for shear-induced migration to be extended to include polymer-mediated interactions. This project will thus generate new design rules for suspensions to maximize particle connectivity during complex fluid flow while minimizing clogging. The PI will disseminate results to scientists in Houston's energy and medical industries through tutorial workshops aimed at oil and gas professionals and through the Texas Soft Matter meeting, which she founded and organizes, and will expand her ongoing outreach activities to K-12 students and the general public to include new hands-on activities on complex fluid flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These compounds are unique, as transparency and conductivity are generally mutually exclusive properties of compounds. Indeed, optical transparency (as in window glass) is generally associated with electrical insulation, whereas electrical conductivity (such as in copper or gold) is generally associated with optically opaque metals. Known transparent conductors such as indium oxide doped with Sn are made by instilling conductivity in transparent insulators. The research team aims to develop a novel family of transparent conductors - metallic ceramics - by designing transparency in metals. This presents a new method to design optical properties as distinct from electronic properties. The approach has an exciting intellectual impact as it suggests a general approach for inverse design - starting from science-based design principles used as 'filters' for computational material selection, followed by identification of representative examples and then laboratory validation. The graduate students and postdocs of CU Boulder and Northwestern Universities are given exciting opportunities to participate in this cutting edge research effort. <br/><br/>Technical description: Transparent conducting oxides are paradoxical materials that form the basis of modern day technologies, such as touch screens, flat panel displays, solar panels, etc. The current method of choice for discovering new transparent conductors have relied on heavily doping transparent insulators until they become conducting. Unfortunately, wide band gap materials are intrinsically resistant to doping of charges because of the existence of so-called 'doping bottlenecks'. Namely, the introduction of a high concentration of free carriers into insulators generally leads to the spontaneous formation of structural defects with polarity that compensate that of the intentional doping. Consequently, the progress in finding and optimizing such technologically critical transparent conducting oxide materials has been frustratingly slow. The research team proposes an opposite, and likely more fruitful alternative of designing transparency in metals by looking for compounds that obey a set of 'design principles' with specific band structures. The design rules for such intrinsic transparent conductors are: (i) identify a compound with metallic band structure; such that (ii) it has low plasma frequency and (iii) low inter-band optical absorption across the Fermi level, and (iv) apply synthesis and characterization to the 'best of class' compounds, here Ba-Nb-O. The most visible advantage of metallic transparent conductors is that their conductivity comes from their high, indigenous carrier concentration. The complex theory-experimental approach in the proposal enables more efficient progress as alternative to the previously used trial-and-error method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its fundamental purpose is to examine and gather initial validity evidence for assessments designed to measure and build Kindergarten-fifth grade science teachers' content knowledge for teaching (CKT) about matter and its interactions in teacher education settings. The selection of this topic will facilitate the development of a proof-of-concept to determine if and how CKT assessments can be developed and used to measure and build elementary teachers' CKT. Also, it will facilitate rapid and targeted refinement of an evidence-centered design process that could be applied to other science topics. Plans are to integrate CKT assessments and related resources into teacher education courses to support the ability of teachers to apply their content knowledge to the work of teaching and learning science. The project will combine efforts from prior projects and engage in foundational research to examine the nature of teachers' CKT and to build theories and hypotheses about the productive use and design of CKT assessment materials to support formative and summative uses. Likewise, the project will create a set of descriptive cases highlighting the use of these tools. Understanding how CKT science assessments can be leveraged as summative tools to evaluate current efforts, and as formative tools to build elementary teachers' specialized, practice-based knowledge will be the central foci of this effort. <br/><br/>The main research questions will be: (1) What is the nature of elementary science teachers' CKT about matter and its interactions?; and (2) How can the development of prospective elementary teachers' CKT be supported within teacher education? To address the research questions, the study will employ a mixed-methods, design-based research approach to gather various sources of validity evidence to support the formative and summative use of the CKT instrument, instructional tasks, and supporting materials. The project will be organized around two main research and development strands. Strand One will build an empirically grounded understanding of the nature of elementary teachers' CKT. Strand Two will focus on developing and studying how CKT instructional tasks can be used formatively within teacher education settings to build elementary teachers' CKT. In addition, the project will refine a conceptual framework that identifies the science-specific teaching practices that comprise the work of teaching science. This will be used as well to assess the CKT that teachers leverage when recognizing, understanding, and responding to the content-intensive practices that they engage in as they teach science. To that end, the study will build on two existing frameworks from prior NSF-funded work. The first was originally developed to create CKT assessments for elementary and middle school teachers in English Language Arts and mathematics. The second focuses on the content challenges that novice elementary science teachers face. It is organized by the instructional tools and practices that elementary science teachers use, such as scientific models and explanations. These instructional practices cut across those addressed in the Next Generation Science Standards' (NGSS; Lead States, 2013) disciplinary strands. The main project's outcomes will be knowledge that builds and refines theories about the nature of elementary teachers' CKT, and how CKT elementary science assessment materials can be designed productively for formative and summative purposes. The project will also result in the development of a suite of valid and reliable assessments that afford interpretations on CKT matter proficiency and can be used to monitor elementary teachers learning. An external advisory board will provide formative and summative feedback on the project's activities and progress.<br/><br/>The DRK-12 Program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

One of the promising candidates, magnonic logic device, utilizes waves of magnetization in nano-structured magnetic materials to transfer and process information, and perform logic operations. Interaction between two or more waves in junctions of wave carrying magnetic wires is used to perform logic operations. Building such device requires the ability to guide waves in magnetic wires of various shapes as well as forming magnetic wire junctions. Any deviation of a magnetic wire shape from a straight wire results in unwanted wave reflection and scattering that significantly limits capabilities of magnonic logic devices. The proposed project will perform a feasibility study of using novel magnetic materials that have potential to overcome such limitations. It is proposed to evaluate feasibility of using ultra-thin magnetic films with preferred out-of-plane magnetization. These materials should allow for building magnonic logic devices with unrestricted geometries of magnetic information-carrying busses and logic junctions. The proposed research will have a broader impact in the field of microwave electronics and magnetic memory technology. In addition, the proposed research will be a unique training ground for future physicists and engineers. Georgia State University is the minority serving institution which graduates the largest number of minority students (primarily African-American) than any other public or private school in the country. This program will facilitate graduate and undergraduate student education in the areas of magnetism, optics and nanotechnology and provide a wide variety experimental skills among which nanofabrication will have most broad applications spectrum.<br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on the feasibility study of the magnonic systems based on ferromagnetic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy will ensure the out-of-plane magnetization of structures resulting in support of isotropic forward volume magnetostatic spin wave modes. The project aims at investigating forward volume magnetostatic spin wave propagation in structured ferromagnetic films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and evaluating feasibility of using these structures for magnonic logic devices. Multi-layered magnetic materials exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy will be used. Spin wave dispersion in these material systems is not significantly affected by spin waveguide shape variation. Therefore, propagation of spin waves will not be altered by the mode-mismatching induced by spin waveguide shape variation. Magnonic logic devices based on the proposed structures will demonstrate stable operation in absence of biasing magnetic fields while uniform external magnetic fields can be used to reconfigure their operation. The proposed project will result in fabrication and characterization of structured multilayered films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy leading to the fundamental understanding of magnetization dynamics in these systems.

How to compare and categorize these surfaces is an urgent and important problem.  This National Science Foundation funded project aims to develop mathematical theories for an efficient and speedy classification of digital surfaces.  A successful completion of this National Science Foundation funded project will have applications in medical imaging, game industry, engineering and many fields. Some of the earlier work of the PI in this area have already been used in health and game industries.  The project work will further advance this progress and develop deep mathematics based on the classical Riemann surface theory and conformal geometry. <br/> <br/>The classical theory of Riemann surfaces is a powerful tool for classifying surfaces up to conformal diffeomorphisms. The most important theorem in the theory is the Poincare-Koebe's uniformization theorem. The theorem has a wide range of applications within and outside mathematics. However, computation of uniformization maps and metrics on non-flat surfaces are very difficult in general. The goal of the proposal is to develop a theory of discrete conformal geometry for polyhedral surfaces, to establish the counterpart of the uniformization theorem in the discrete setting, and to prove convergence of discrete conformal maps to conformal maps. The PI will develop efficient algorithms to compute uniformization metrics through collaboration.  The main ingredient in developing a discrete conformal geometry is to define the notion of discrete conformality. In a recent joint work with collaborators, the PI introduced a notion of discrete conformal equivalence for polyhedral metrics on surfaces. The PI and his collaborators proved a discrete version of uniformization theorem for compact polyhedral surfaces and showed that discrete conformal maps converge to conformal maps on tori and disks.  There remain several major open problems of establishing the convergence of discrete conformal maps for all surfaces and proving the discrete uniformization theorem for all non-compact simply connected surfaces. The discrete conformality introduced by us is closely related to the work of Alexandrov, Pogorelov and Thurston on convex surfaces in hyperbolic three-space, the classical Wyle problem and the Koebe circle domain conjecture.  Tools developed in the classical area of mathematics will be used to solve the proposed problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, research on the control of migration is critical from both basic and applied perspectives. Understanding how animals decide when to move is of particular importance given that this can dictate whether or not they arrive at their destination at an appropriate time for reproduction or overwintering. Many animals move in groups and social interactions and social cues are expected to be important in the decisions that animals make in preparation for and during migration. Yet, there is little known about the role of social cues in determining when animals begin or end migration or about the physiological mechanisms by which social signals might act to influence migratory timing. This collaborative project will address these two knowledge gaps using two species of migratory songbirds that have flexible migratory schedules and that are highly sensitive to social information. Results of this work will advance our understanding of how social cues influence both migratory timing and the hormonal regulation of migration. This project will also provide training and mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach activities linked to the project will engage elementary school students and the general public in migratory biology. Training and outreach activities at the university level and in elementary schools will target individuals from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The first goal of this collaborative project is to evaluate the influence of social cues (specifically, the migratory state of conspecifics) on the timing of migration. Experiments will be carried out to test the hypotheses that birds use cues from conspecifics to fine-tune timing of initiation and termination of migration. Social cues have not been well studied in the context of migratory timing and the project's inclusion of the termination phase of migration will be important in advancing the understanding of this particularly understudied phase of migration. The second goal of the project is to advance understanding of the endocrine and neuroendocrine regulation of migratory transitions, with the further objective of investigating how social cues influence endocrine and neuroendocrine parameters to potentially alter migratory timing. Thus, investigators will quantify changes in circulating steroid hormones and the availability of their receptors in the brain and peripheral tissues across transitions into and out of a migratory state. This type of whole-body approach to understanding endocrine mechanisms in the context of migration is unique. The investigators will also experimentally manipulate social cues to evaluate endocrine and neuroendocrine mechanisms by which these cues might influence migratory timing. The results of this project will thus greatly broaden understanding of the roles of social cues and plasticity of endocrine mechanisms in life history transitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first part concerns the economics of climate change. Climate change could be a very impactful global risk; its mitigation becomes an interdisciplinary challenge involving a multitude of sciences and agencies. The second part studies how collective behavior can result from individual preferences in stochastic games; this is useful to understand macroscopic effects in systems with many decision-takers, such as financial crises in securities markets. The third part investigates the emergence of speculative price bubbles in asset markets as a consequence of heterogeneity among market participants. The fourth part studies the existence of probability densities for certain stochastic processes and produces estimates for these densities.<br/><br/>The complexity of the climate response and its interaction with the economy gives rise to model ambiguity and stochastic uncertainty in decision making. Nevertheless, the existing literature largely relies on deterministic models. This project aims to emphasize the impact of uncertainty and ambiguity on risk assessment and policy making, as well as initiating a transfer of knowledge from fields such as mathematical finance where stochastic models are routinely employed. Regarding stochastic games, the project studies models with mean field interaction which, at least formally, correspond to games with a continuum of players. It is expected that multiplicity of equilibria is related to coalitions of agents, and a notion of stability may be useful to understand why certain equilibria of mean field games are limits of N-player games but others are not. The third project will continue recent work that aims to develop a robust stochastic model for speculation among heterogeneous agents and investigate how market regulations and the distribution of beliefs among market participants influence prices and speculative trading in a bubble. The study of probability densities for stochastic processes follows a novel approach based on optimal control theory. It allows for remarkably general processes, including non-Markovian ones, while being elementary in nature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photosynthesis works well when plants are not exposed to environmental stress, but when plants are too hot, or drought stressed, this process becomes inefficient. Plants have evolved two main alternative photosynthetic pathways in response to environmental stresses, CAM and C4 photosynthesis. C4 and CAM have each evolved many times, and it has been thought that C4 evolved in response to hot temperatures and CAM in response to drought. Similarly, these two pathways were assumed to be incompatible at cellular and genetic levels. However, a C4-CAM plant has been discovered: Portulaca, which performs C4 photosynthesis normally, but performs CAM under drought. This project aims to understand the function and ecological significance of a C4-CAM photosynthetic system. The research team will discover how many times C4-CAM evolved in Portulaca, and will identify the spatial configuration of both pathways within the leaf. They will identify the genes that regulate both pathways, and will compare the ecological ranges of C4-CAM species with relatives that do not have this trait. Finally, they will survey other plants to identify additional origins of this novel photosynthesis type. This research may contribute to crop improvement- for example, efforts to engineer C4 into rice, and CAM into poplar. A C4-CAM crop could be highly productive when water is prevalent, but drought-resistant when water is scarce. In addition, this award will support a broad range of educational activities, including post-doctoral and graduate student training, undergraduate research, and high school teacher training and curriculum development.<br/><br/>C4 and CAM photosynthesis are two metabolic pathways that have evolved multiple times. Though biochemically similar, each pathway requires a unique suite of anatomical characters in order to work efficiently, and conventional wisdom holds that these characters are antagonistic, such that anatomy that facilitates efficient C4 will simultaneously disadvantage a CAM metabolism. This widely accepted view cannot, however, accommodate Portulaca, the only plants currently known to operate both C4 and CAM cycles within a single leaf. Recent work suggests that ancestral Portulaca was a facultative CAM plant, and evolved a C4 system while maintaining CAM capability at least three times. The proposed research will test this hypothesis and develop Portulaca as a model lineage for investigating the evolutionary connectivity of C4 and CAM pathways. This project aims to: 1) confirm the existence of facultative CAM in all major Portulaca lineages, and characterize CAM and C4 biochemical cycles and differential gene expression in 7 species representing all C4 origins; 2) identify the spatial configuration of C4 and CAM cycles within the leaf, using in situ hybridization and protein immunolocalization; 3) utilize recently designed targeted gene enrichment baits (HybSeq) to sequence key photosynthetic (and other) genes from across Portulaca to improve phylogenetic resolution and analyze convergent molecular adaptation across the group; 4) characterize and contrast the climatic envelopes occupied by C4-CAM Portulaca and C3-CAM related lineages; and 5) initiate phylogenetically-informed physiological surveys to discover additional C4-CAM plants in other clades.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded in the Biology Directorate of NSF by Integrative Ecological Physiology in the Integrative Organismal Systems Division, Systematics and Biodiversity Science in the Division of Environmental Biology, and Emerging Frontiers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While providing more detailed information about the associated physical phenomena occurring around us, they also pose statistical challenges related to interpretable modeling and feasible computation for such data.  Data measured over space, time, or some other continuum, are fittingly termed functional data, and constitute an important subfield of modern statistics.  This project will develop important methodology for the analysis of two types of functional data.  The first set of projects aim at the estimation of dependency patterns between components of so-called multivariate functional data, where a common set of features is measured over time for each subject in a study, such as neuroimaging scans where signals are recorded over time at a variety of spatial locations.  Another important class of functional data are samples of distributions or histograms, which regularly arise in the analysis of demographic data as mortality distributions, for example, but also in other important fields such as neuroscience and finance.  This project outlines methods for dimension reduction and regression that respect the well-known positivity and area-under-the-curve constraints for distributions, yielding interpretable data summaries and model fits that provide the practitioner with a clearer understanding of the information contained in their data.<br/><br/>Both fMRI and EEG yield time-dependent signals at multiple brain locations, resulting in multivariate functional data.  Quantifying connectivity patterns to define brain networks, for example in order to identify normal and pathological characteristics, is an important neuroscientific problem that can be addressed using multivariate functional data techniques.  This project seeks to advance the use of functional graphical models to estimate underlying brain dependency networks, including improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods. These methods are equally applicable in other domains that produce data of similar structure, such as longitudinal medical studies, where a common set of measurements is recorded repeatedly over time.  Also considered in this proposal are methods for distributional data, which can be thought of as collections of curves or surfaces, each corresponding to a probability distribution.  For example, neuroimaging data naturally provide such distributional samples, as levels of myelination or signal correlations within brain regions are high-dimensional data that can be effectively summarized at the subject level by a histogram or distribution.  Given a sample of such distributional data, this project investigates statistical methods of interpretable dimension reduction and dependency of distributional response functions on relevant covariates through distributional regression.  A key tool is the Wasserstein metric for distributions, which has been widely successful in applied settings, but has not been utilized to its full extent in statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particular mathematical tools that have proved extremely useful in addressing questions of these types and providing a framework to analyze these simple building blocks lie within the realm of harmonic analysis.

A second research direction provides a holomorphic functional calculus on a manifold with ends and studies the open question of obtaining the boundedness of the Riesz transform using ideas from non-homogeneous harmonic analysis and the techniques developed by the principal investigator.

This application leads to reduced complication rates, improved shock absorption and biocompatibility, and overall increased patient satisfaction.

However, typical polyurethane rubbers or silicones are inherently soft and/or have a slow recovery from large deformations; this limits its usefulness in many important situations. NiTi is the ideal material to compliment these shortcomings due to its own set of unique characteristics. Similar to metals, it is orders of magnitude stronger and stiffer than LCEs, but NiTi also undergoes shape-memory behavior that leads large recoverable deformation. Additionally, it also provides biasing stress to the LCEs that should greatly reduce the recovery time of the composite material. The combination of these unique and varied properties will give the composite material a level of customization and tailored behavior that is simply not achievable with any of the constituents independently and will be of interest from both a research perspective and attractive as a marketable product.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historically, the development of metallic alloys has focused on modifying alloys with one dominant element, such as aluminum or titanium, by adding small percentages of other elements. This strategy neglects the vast design space represented by alloys consisting of several elements in roughly equal fractions. Because many millions of combinations exist within this design space, identifying specific compositions of interest using conventional trial-and-error approaches to alloy development would be very time-consuming and expensive. A rapid and inexpensive method for efficiently screening the possible candidate compositions is required. This project uses computer simulations to identify combinations of elements with the potential for improved properties, and then manufactures only the most promising combinations for further consideration. To further reduce costs, an advanced 3D printing-based synthesis method is used to construct compact material libraries consisting of approximately 100 distinct compositions. The alloy library construction is accomplished in minutes, using only a few grams of material. The libraries are screened to identify the specific compositions with the best combinations of strength, density, cost, or other properties. This 'high-throughput' approach to metal alloy design will dramatically increase efficiency and reduce the cost required to discover and optimize new high performance metallic materials. Furthermore, the project will contribute to development of a science and engineering workforce trained in computational and efficient manufacturing methods, as well as impact K-12 science and engineering education through workshops targeting middle and high school teachers from diverse school districts.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Meeting the design requirements of the next generation of high performance transportation systems, power generators, and energy storage devices requires the discovery and development of new structural alloys with enhanced properties. Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), consisting of several constituent elements but no dominant solvent species, represent a vast yet under-explored design space due to the time-consuming nature of traditional alloy design methods. The objective of this collaborative project is to investigate the role of chemical composition on the phase-stability and mechanical properties of MPEAs having a dominant BCC phase using a high-throughput approach. The project integrates first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and state-of-the-art laser deposition-based synthesis to rapidly discover MPEAs with desirable combinations of strength, density, melting temperature, and cost. The local structure is characterized using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope imaging and spectroscopy, which are combined with DFT calculations to elucidate the roles of configurational entropy, mixing enthalpy, lattice strains and other factors on phase stability. Variations in the mechanical properties with composition are characterized using nanoindentation and other micromechanical methods and correlated with the structure in order to develop appropriate structure-property models. Alloys with the most promising microscale properties will be prepared in bulk for further analysis and model validation. By enabling rapid evaluation over the full breadth of the multicomponent design space, the project has the potential to deepen the scientific community's understanding of these complex alloys and identify new materials with vastly improved and unexpected combinations of properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The modules will be aligned with the high school Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and key statistical content for college students. The purpose of the study is to strengthen existing theories of how to design classroom learning materials to support two primary sets of outcomes for high school students, particularly among those historically underrepresented in STEM fields: 1) stronger understandings of important statistics concepts and data analysis practices, and 2) interest in statistics and working with data.  The modules will engage students in a four-step investigative process where they will (1) formulate questions that can be answered with data; (2) design and implement a plan to assemble appropriate data; (3) use numerical and graphical methods to explore the data; and (4) summarize conclusions relating back to the original questions and citing relevant components of the analysis that support their interpretation and acknowledging other interpretations.<br/><br/>The project will employ a Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) design using both quantitative and qualitative data to determine results of targeted outcomes (noted above) as well track whether there is any evidence to support the conjectures that key module components directly impact targeted student outcomes. Starting with a well-defined, preliminary conceptual framework for the study, the project team will conduct four cycles of iterative design and testing of the proposed SDLC modules over two academic years, with each cycle occurring during a fall or spring semester.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, since existing methods for preparing such devices are not suitable for 2D materials, new approaches must be discovered that promote their easy integration into device constructs. This project studies 2D materials that are coated with polymers, which can be applied with extreme precision to manipulate the physical and electronic properties at specific locations. This promotes inexpensive, large-scale fabrication of electronic and optical devices within single sheets of 2D materials, enabling applications in low-power, nanoscale electronic and optical devices, including wearable and conformable devices. This project includes summer research opportunities for middle and high school students as well as recruitment and mentoring of underrepresented minority students at UMass Amherst, and outreach to the community in Western Massachusetts. US-Israel scientific collaborations are enhanced by graduate students exchanges between partner institutions.<br/><br/>Technical Description: A major challenge in harnessing 2D materials for optoelectronic devices arises from limited avenues for exercising precise control over charge carrier concentrations (doping). This project focuses on Mo and W transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with the goal of modulating their optoelectronic properties through novel interfacial chemistries that are more straightforward and robust to implement than direct substitutional doping of the TMDC itself. An integrated theory-synthesis-characterization approach facilitates rational design and application of organochalcogen- and dipole-rich functional polymers for precise, spatially-targeted control over carrier doping, work functions, and band gaps of TMDCs. This hard-soft, 2D materials platform, enables the preparation of optoelectronic devices such as photodiodes, transistors, and inverters - key building blocks of digital electronics - fabricated within 2D monolayers using methods that are scalable and compatible with existing semiconductor technology. Fundamental advances in the development of polymer-TMDC semiconductors project far-reaching impact on optoelectronic devices, enabling technologies in computing, data storage, and consumer electronics. The research program is integrated with formative summer research opportunities for undergraduates from minority-serving institutions, as well as local middle- and high-school students, thereby nurturing the next generation of materials scientists and engineers. Researchers also deliver informal lectures to the broader public in Western Massachusetts to kindle interest in the emerging field of 2D materials.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Molly J. Crockett at Yale University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating how social media environments may amplify our expression and experience of moral outrage. More specifically, this project asks whether the positive social feedback received on social media can make outrage expression more rewarding and in turn, lead to the expression of outrage. This project will contribute to an understanding of the documented growth in polarization and decline of civil discourse by identifying specific characteristics of the social media environment and psychological processes that may contribute. Results can inform the development of interventions targeting the feedback delivery system of social media and people's tendency to infer social approval.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to develop and test a foundational theory of moral outrage in the digital age, specifically proposing that social media environments amplify moral outrage because the positive social feedback received on social media is conducive to habit-forming outrage expression and internalization of perceived outrage expression norms. To test this theory, this project will use a multi-method approach that combines the ecological validity of studying naturally-formed social networks in social media with the precise control of experimental manipulations and reinforcement learning paradigms. This project seeks to expand psychological theory in several important ways. First, it expands upon functional theories of moral emotions in the affective sciences by articulating how the pervasive social media environment shapes the way emotions are experienced, expressed, and how their function may change. Second, this research expands theories of prosocial behavior and cooperation by highlighting how the function of moral outrage expression in the digital age may be better understood as ingroup signaling rather than norm enforcement. Third, this research expands theories of intergroup conflict by suggesting a new set of processes that may be antecedents of negative emotions felt toward certain groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is only in the past few years, however, that research exploring oxide thin films for practical applications has emerged. Many of these materials exhibit excellent chemical performance, rivaling that of expensive precious metals such as platinum and iridium. This is particularly true for reactions that are relevant to fuel cells: the oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions, which are both necessary for fuel cell technology. Various oxides have been shown to perform well in one reaction or the other, but few, if any, individual materials match the performance of platinum in both reactions. This project focuses on the synthesis of a composite material that combines two distinct types of oxides into a single surface so that their combined behavior can lead to catalytic performance that matches or exceeds precious metals. The research is integrated with outreach activities to encourage middle and high school students to pursue careers in science, math, and technology through participation in the Auburn University Summer Science Institute and Destination STEM. Through these programs, the PIs will perform demonstrations and lead group activities for students in rural and underserved areas of Alabama to broaden their exposure to science. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Complex oxide thin films have been studied for many years for their wide array of properties, including ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity. The development of metal oxide materials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis is directly relevant to fuel cell technologies. In this project the investigators perform systematic synthetic studies of transition metal oxides using molecular beam epitaxy to generate epitaxial matrix-pillar nanocomposite thin films where the perovskite oxide matrix phase is a strong OER catalyst and the spinel oxide pillar phase targets ORR. The work is delineated into three tasks: synthesis of perovskite and spinel powders, epitaxial thin films, and nanocomposites; spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization of electronic structure and band alignment, including ambient-pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies; and preliminary electrocatalytic studies of uniform thin films and nanocomposites. These studies address fundamental materials chemistry and surface science questions as they relate to improving the performance and economic viability of transition metal oxide hybrid bifunctional materials. The project also provides educational experiences for undergraduate students to learn about materials characterization and for graduate students to perform state-of-the-art experiments at national user facilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All chemical reactions in the living cell involve molecules bumping and sticking to one another, and molecular form or structure is a central determinant of complementarity and strength of molecular interactions. In particular, by assuming specific structures, proteins are able to regulate diverse processes that maintain and replicate the living cell. With structure determination in laboratories lagging desperately behind the rapidly-growing number of protein-encoding gene sequences by high-throughput sequencing technologies, computational approaches to the problem of protein structure prediction now have a central role in molecular biology. This project advances algorithmic research to address the current impasse in form-function related problems in molecular biology. In particular, the project develops advanced  optimization methods to explore the vast protein structure space and leverages information-integration techniques under the deep learning framework to effectively guide the exploration towards biologically-active structures. This project will benefit researchers of diverse sub-communities in computational and biological sciences, result in open source, publicly-available software packages, and provide excellent training and mentoring opportunities for under-represented students at the interface of computational science and computational biology.<br/><br/><br/>This project advances algorithmic research in information integration and informatics to address the current impasse in structure-function related problems in computational structural biology. The main focus is on the de-novo protein structure prediction problem, which is central to inferring biological activities of a rapidly-growing number of protein-encoding gene sequences. The proposed research generalizes the problem of exploring and obtaining a comprehensive view of a protein's structure space as that of computing a diverse ensemble of constraint-satisfying structures and then leveraging information-integration techniques to guide the exploration to regions of the structure space relevant for biological activity. The research proposes hybrid stochastic optimization algorithms for comprehensive exploration of protein structure spaces, deep convolutional neural networks for better assessment of structure nativeness, and combines the two in an information-integration algorithmic framework to guide the exploration of a structure space towards native structures. By doing so, the proposed research investigates a direction complementary to physics-based treatments, proposing to supplant such treatments with machine-learned models of nativeness. The research will benefit researchers in machine learning, stochastic optimization, and information integration with application-driven interests in molecular modeling, protein structure prediction, and modeling of complex, dynamic systems. The research will be disseminated via various venues, including an open-source software package, and will provide training opportunities for under-represented students of all levels at the interface of optimization, deep learning, and computational biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first direction involves the mathematical study of waves such as water waves or sound waves. Both physical experiments and numerical simulations exhibit the phenomenon of turbulence: fluids that are initially very smoothly-flowing and slowly-varying can develop much more complicated eddies and fine-scale behavior.  It remains unknown whether the equations that model fluid dynamics can give rise to ""blow-up,"" in which some portion of the simulated fluid achieves infinite velocity. This project studies the extent to which blow-up can be ""engineered"" by tweaking the equations that model fluid mechanics, such as changing the number of dimensions in space. The second direction involves questions related to the notorious twin prime conjecture in number theory. This conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that are separated by a distance of two, such as 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and 19, and so on.  It is still not known whether the assertion is true, but recently much progress has been made on understanding more tractable questions, such as how often it occurs that a pair of numbers, separated by a distance of two, both have an odd number of prime factors. This project aims to develop these promising new techniques further, with potential application to proving or disproving the twin primes conjecture and to other difficult, important questions in number theory. <br/><br/>In more detail, the fluid dynamical part of the project focuses primarily on variants of the Euler equations for incompressible fluids, especially higher-dimensional Euler equations on Riemannian manifolds. The ability to select the metric of such a manifold gives a promising way to ""program"" the equations to exhibit certain desirable behavior. Prior work has established that the dynamics of certain quadratic ordinary differential equations can be programmed into such systems.  The project will continue work towards exhibiting finite-time blow-up (or other interesting behavior, such as Turing universality) for these models. For the number-theoretic aspects of the project, the investigator and collaborators aim to establish further cases of the Chowla conjecture (or its logarithmically-averaged variants) on correlations of the Liouville function, by combining the recently-developed entropy decrement method with techniques from analytic number theory, combinatorics, and ergodic theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI plans to attract, involve, and educate students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels at the University of Utah through research seminars and student programs. Students will benefit from exposure to this interdisciplinary field and be an integral part of the research, participating at regular group meetings and discussions, and given the opportunity to present their research findings at conferences. The proposed education plan includes the development of two courses, Introduction to Optimization and Introduction to Data Science, which will serve students throughout the University of Utah's Schools of Science and Engineering.

Due to associated variational characterizations and stochastic processes, these methods are geometrically and/or physically interpretable and have provable properties, complementing and extending traditional data analytic methods from statistics and computer science. The proposed research plan has three primary goals. The first goal is to study foundational questions related to the Cheeger formulation of the graph partitioning problem and connections to graph curvature and Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) diffusion generated motion. In particular, a new probabilistic interpretation of the MBO method will lead to efficient algorithms that systematically balance partition components. The second goal is to use a generalization of vector fields, called N-direction fields or cross fields when N=4, for a variety of tasks in geometry processing and image analysis. This work is well-motivated by recent progress of the PI and his graduate student on the generation of boundary-aligned quadrilateral meshes based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory. In part, this will involve the extension of the MBO algorithm and associated Lyapunov function to approximate harmonic maps with image in generalized sets. The third goal is to develop efficient methods for analyzing simplicial complexes, generalizing and extending methods for analyzing graphs. To overcome the inherent computational costs due to the non-local and multi-scale nature of simplicial complexes, the PI will develop efficient sparsification algorithms based on preserving the spectrum of associated generalized Laplacian operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When the ice sheet collapsed, those fresh lake waters were released to the Atlantic Ocean, and are thought to have disrupted ocean circulation, causing abrupt cold spells in the northern hemisphere, and perhaps globally.  Near southern Ontario and northern New York State, enormous Glacial Lake Iroquois contained massive amounts of cold fresh water, and modern remnants of that lake include Lake Ontario and Oneida Lake.  Oneida Lake is located near the easternmost part of ancient Glacial Lake Iroquois, and this area and the Mohawk Valley were a key valve for the release of meltwaters to the Hudson River and to the Atlantic.  The Oneida Lake project will study the ancient sediments laid down during these meltwater releases, to determine their precise timing, and will then compare those timings to past climate records derived from Greenland ice cores and from sediments from the Southern and the Atlantic Oceans.  The researchers will use geophysical (sonar) methods to image the sediments below the bottom of Oneida Lake, and then collect sediment cores for detailed analyses.  Special Carbon-14 dating techniques will be used to date sediments in the cores and to correlate the layered sediments to similar records previously collected in New England.  Project outreach efforts include a public lecture series for lake-side communities, engagements with Oneida Nation high school science classes, and the installation of science information kiosks at a State Park on the lake?s eastern edge.<br/><br/>This project is examining the Late Quaternary sediment record from the Oneida Basin in Upstate New York, through analyses of new geophysical data and new sediment cores. The unusually rich stratigraphic archive will constrain the paleoclimate evolution along the SE margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in the terminal Pleistocene. The researchers will also develop an energy balance hydrologic model of ancient Glacial Lake Iroquois to better constrain fill and discharge events from this basin. Non-linear episodes that perturb the global climate system (e.g., the Younger Dryas cooling) include major meltwater pulses and drainage pathway switches associated with Glacial Lake Iroquois and its precursors. The researchers will evaluate Termination I (the end of the last glaciation, ~20,000 years ago) at seasonal resolution over several millennia, using the rich varved sediment record in Oneida Lake and surrounding outcrops. Outcrop observations of newly discovered lake sediment exposures (varves) in the basin will be integrated with correlative sedimentary sequences recovered by cores from Oneida Lake. The glacial varve record will be chronologically constrained via paleomagnetic methods (cross-dating) with the North American Varve Chronology and further fixed by selective use of Ramped PyrOx radiocarbon dating of organic matter and separately of pollen 14C dating. Preliminary high-resolution seismic data reveal a remarkable, high-fidelity stratigraphy with evidence for outburst flood events, ice sheet instabilities, and a continuous time series from deglaciation through the Holocene. The full lake will be surveyed at high spatial resolution using CHIRP (sweep signal seismic) and multichannel seismic reflection methods. The calibrated time series of events will be compared to three well-established global archives: the Greenland ice core record, the Antarctic Peninsula Palmer Deep and Cariaco Basin marine sections. Beyond the direct scientific outcomes and graduate student training, the researchers will mount an outreach effort including: 1) a riparian community lecture series; 2) construction of two information kiosks describing the geologic evolution of Glacial Lake Iroquois and subsequent evolution of Oneida Lake at two lakeside parks; and 3) engage under-represented groups including secondary school students from the Oneida Nation during both field and laboratory activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The performance of a composite changes with many factors, so developing a new composite commonly requires a large number of experiments to optimize the manufacture parameters if a parametric experimental approach is adopted. Through accurately reproducing the complex material processing and testing by virtual experiments, physical experiments can be reliably simulated on the computer, and thus significantly reduce both the material development time and cost. Application of the inclusion-based boundary element method (iBEM) is planned to create high fidelity simulation of the material behavior and will be used for the virtual experiments of the particulate composites. While the principles and methodologies developed can be applied to general composites, this project focuses on lightweight concrete (LWC), which is made of foam particles mixed in a cement paste. Its unique thermal, acoustic and lightweight properties make it an excellent material for energy efficient building envelope. This project will produce a new tool to accelerate the design and development cycle of advanced materials, which will produce significant benefits to our manufacturing industry and thus to the U.S. economy. The multidisciplinary research covering theoretical, numerical and experimental aspects will promote our student research and education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). <br/><br/>This project integrates computation, experiments, and micromechanics together to establish a new design paradigm that advances the state-of-the-art of the design of particulate composites in the following aspects: 1) The random particulate microstructure generation algorithm will provide a practical method to construct digital composite materials; 2) The iBEM, simulating each inhomogeneity as an inclusion with an eigenstrain through the Green function technique, will avoid meshing inside the representative volume element (RVE), enable the simulation of >1000 inhomogeneities, and therefore provide a more objective, realistic description of material samples; 3) Interactions of inhomogeneities across two length scales (micron and millimeter) will be evaluated to predict the failure process through the microstructural evolution of the composite, and; 4) The virtual experiments, validated by a few actual experiments, will reproduce the mechanical behavior on computer and accelerate material design and the optimization process of new composite materials. The success of this project will not only establish our LWC design method, but also lead to a breakthrough in computer-aided design (CAD) of particulate composites. In addition, it will demonstrate the iBEM as a new continuum method to study particle interactions of many-particle systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Systemic risk corresponds to rare events of many defaults in cascade, disrupting liquidity and the economy as a whole. This research project concerns modeling this network in interaction and studying the limiting behavior as the number of agents becomes large. The project studies Nash equilibria, whose limits are described by so-called mean field games. The focus is on the effects of time delays and randomness on the network itself. This research aims to help understand and ultimately prevent the occurrence of systemic adverse events. From the point of view of the regulators, it is important to rank institutions according to their contributions to systemic risk; on the other hand, this ranking needs to be fair to the banks. The research also aims to develop mathematical tools to measure systemic risk and design fair allocation schemes.<br/><br/>Mathematically, systemic risk events in the network of banks correspond to a large deviation principle describing the occurrence of the small probability events in which a large number of participants are defaulting. The research consists in using mean field game theory to derive large deviation of the finite player games. The first goal is to consider the effect of delays in the game and develop the corresponding theory of mean field games with delay. The second goal is to study large deviations for games on stochastic networks. The main tool will be to use the master equation for the corresponding mean field game, specifically to explore how the stochastic nature of the network will affect the rate function in the large deviation principle. The third goal is to develop a duality approach to the systemic risk measures introduced in previous work, to ensure fairness of systemic risk allocations to the participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technique is able to determine what portion of the Holocene a glacier advanced beyond and retreated behind its current terminus by quantifying the buildup of both 14C and 10Be during periods of exposure and the preferential loss of 14C during episodes of ice cover due to its much shorter half-life. Our latitudinal transect is designed to maximize understanding of how glaciers responded to orbital variations, as well as how climate may have been coupled between the low and high latitudes and across the hemispheres. Given that Holocene glacier trends may have varied substantially with latitude, the broad scale of our reconstructions will also provide the context needed for evaluating current glacier retreat around the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are many diseases that are caused by cells that don't die at the correct time.  The death of cells is changed by physical forces applied to and generated within tissues. However, relatively little is known about how the forces change the timing or speed of cell death. The interior molecules of a cell create and carry loads between cells. The goal of this research is to determine the specific role of the molecule actin, and the pathways that control actin, in the mechanical regulation of cell death. The work will identify small and large size molecules that can be manipulated by drugs to change how loads regulate cell death in many diseases, including tumors, heart disease, arthritis and osteoporosis. The project will support training of a doctoral student and six undergraduate researchers (REU) mentored between our campuses. As part of the program, these student researchers mentor girls from underserved middle-schools in a one-week program focused on gaining confidence through independent mini-research projects.<br/><br/>This project will advance the fundamental understanding of how forces are generated by single cells and within the context of multicellular tissues. It will elucidate how mechanical forces regulate cell death. The role of cell forces and actin dynamics in apoptosis will be studied at multiple scales; in clusters of cells, in individual cells, and at the molecular signaling scale. The overall approach is mechanics-based and combines experimental and computational models that inform each other to obtain accurate maps of the force distribution within cells and tissues. The work will identify how mechanical forces, the actin cytoskeleton, and relevant signaling pathways collectively regulate apoptosis. Quantitative knowledge of the mechanical signals that induce apoptosis and the mechanisms transmitting these signals is fundamental for understanding the underlying pathophysiology of various disease states that involve improper control of cell death.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nearly half of the building collapses in the U.S. due to causes other than natural disasters are related to construction or design error, deterioration, or overloading. The majority of these failures result in partial or total collapse and occur during the service life of the building under sustained gravity loads. The formation of local damage and the evolution from local failure to global collapse are often not immediate; instead, they are complex time-dependent phenomena, for which little knowledge exists. The fundamental knowledge obtained from this project will facilitate better interpretation of early warning signs of building collapse for more prudent evacuation, rescue, and stabilization decisions; advance prediction and evaluation of a damaged building safety; and ultimately inform design for safer and more robust buildings able to resist collapse. These outcomes will reduce the economic and societal impact of building failure. The project will partner with the engineering community for immediate dissemination of the research, engage under-represented groups, and increase public scientific engagement, and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The impact of sustained loads on collapse evolution of two common types of reinforced concrete buildings, moment frames and flat-plates, will be studied by experimental simulations and numerical modeling.

At the material scale, the research generates knowledge for confinement effects on concrete creep at sustained high stresses; at the component scale, the research will generate knowledge of the effects of creep and shear crack opening on the sustained loading response of columns, axially restrained beams in frames, and slab-column connections; at the system scale, the research will lead to a crucial understanding the performance and collapse risk of frame and flat-plate systems under high sustained loads and the collapse evolution mechanism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When we listen to music, when we use our cell phones, when we warm up a dinner in a microwave, when we look at the stars in the sky and when we relax on a sunny beach. But wave phenomena may also affect the lives of millions of people when earthquakes shake and propagate, tsunamis form or nuclear radiations get out of control.  Indeed, waves naturally arise occur in a variety of physical systems such as nonlinear optics, atmosphere and ocean waves, quantum mechanics and plasmas. The study of waves  is fundamental for the understanding of phenomena at both a very small scale, such as the Bose-Einstein Condensate, and at a very large one, such as collusion of galaxies. These expressions of nature are never too smooth and rarely too simple: interactions of small waves can produce very large outcomes, such as freak waves, while complicated objects such as  solitons almost do not see each other when they cross. Phenomena such as these are the byproduct of nonlinear wave interactions, and understanding what  are the possible outcomes, given the initial state of a system of waves, is fundamental to predict and  to control it, hopefully to our advantage. <br/><br/>In this NSF supported research the PIs present a series of projects at the cutting edge of research in nonlinear wave phenomena in which deterministic approaches, classically based on harmonic and Fourier analysis, are implemented alongside probabilistic ones to capture basic properties of wave phenomena. It has become clear in recent years that deterministic methods and probabilistic ones naturally feed off each other and when combined not only contribute to our understanding but also open the door to new paradigms to move research forward in various directions. More precisely, the PIs propose four  projects  at the forefront of nonlinear evolution equations, where the interplay of deterministic and probabilistic  approaches is the key to make progress. The problems range from the study of weak turbulence for dispersive and fluid equations to the analysis  of integrable structures, from  the definition of Gibbs type measures to the probabilistic existence and stability of certain geometric flows enjoying null form nonlinearities. The probabilistic component of PIs' work in the last few years has contributed in bridging the dispersive and wave  nonlinear equations community with that specialized in stochastic partial differential equations. This interaction has created ongoing collaborations between members of these two communities. The work that the PIs, their students and collaborators will generate in solving the problems described in this project will further solidify the interactions between these two vibrant communities.

In two dimensions, this is a relatively simple question which was addressed in the early part of the 20th century.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the area of mathematics known as Representation Theory had applications to this goal in dimension three.  In the late 1990s the program of categorification, which encompasses various areas of mathematics, was introduced to tackle this question in dimension four. This National Science Foundation funded collaborative project aims to further this already deep connection between the two fundamental fields of mathematics. <br/><br/>Soon after quantum groups were introduced in the 1980s, certain knot invariants, such as the Jones polynomial, were constructed from these objects.  Specializing the parameter of a quantum group to a root of unity led to invariants of three-dimensional manifolds.  Categorification is an interdisciplinary area of research which seeks to ""upgrade"" certain structures in mathematics such as replacing numbers with vector spaces and vector spaces with categories.  A link homology discovered in the 1990s categorified the Jones polynomial.  This led a surge in research in categorifying various aspects of quantum groups and their representations at a generic value of the quantum parameter.  In order to categorify three-manifold invariants coming from quantum groups, one must try to understand categorified quantum groups at a root of unity.  The subject of hopfological algebra was outlined in the early 2000s to accomplish this goal.  Quantum groups at roots of unity are associative algebras defined over rings of cyclotomic polynomials.  Such rings are categorified by stable categories of modules over truncated polynomial algebras.  The investigators will look for module categories over these stable categories in order to try to categorify the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity including knot and three-manifold invariants.  In order to categorify the associated 3-dimensional TQFT, one must work over a slightly larger ring where certain integers are inverted.  This ring has been categorified recently and the investigators will attempt to incorporate this structure into categorical representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two-dimensional materials are atomically thin films with properties that can revolutionize low-power electronics, biological detection, multi-functional composites and energy storage applications that promise important benefits for the US society and economy. The roadblock to these applications is that, when grown in large size, the two-dimensional material's crystallinity is poor and conventional heat treatment does not improve the crystallinity because the materials are typically resistant to high temperatures. This award enables the investigation of a fundamentally different approach, where a two-dimensional material is grown over a large area with initially low quality, which is then greatly improved through the combination of electrical and mechanical treatments. This is a multi-disciplinary approach, which trains the graduate students in cutting edge aspects of nanomanufacturing, materials science and mechanical engineering. The project involves undergraduate, women and under-represented minority students in research to better train the diverse work force of the future.<br/><br/>This award investigates the manufacture of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials over large areas by atomic layer or pulsed layer deposition. The as-grown nanosteets are usually of low crystallinity. The crystallinity is enhanced with a combination of electron wind force and mechanical stress. The electrons transfer their momentum at the defects and grain boundaries to impart unprecedented atomic/defect mobility at lower temperatures. The role of mechanical stress is to accelerate the electrical annealing. The hypothesis is that the stress field around the defect can intensify the local strain energy, which is a driving force for crystallization and grain growth. Computational models, based on reactive empirical bond-order potential with the electron wind force imparted to individual atoms, are developed to guide the experimental research. Experiments are performed inside the transmission electron microscope to understand the synthesis of ultra-thin films and electro-mechanical annealing. The in-situ microscopy reveals the transformation from a low quality amorphous phase to a highly crystalline state. The research demonstrates that high crystallinity 2D atomic layer materials can be achieved by a novel electrical and mechanical treatment instead of conventional heat treatment. The research also investigates scaling up of this technique by wafer-scale synthesis on a substrate coated for high residual stress followed by electrical annealing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials systems provide a new platform for electronic and photonic devices. One interesting approach to investigating the nature of these materials is by stacking various types of them to form new hybrid layered materials. The electronic properties of the resulting stacks are governed by electrical forces and interactions between the various layers. This research explores the controlling factors that determine the interlayer interactions. Findings from this study are used to achieve rational design of stacks with desirable electronic and optical properties, which may be suitable for new types of optoelectronic devices.  Educationally, a special topic course work is designed to introduce this new frontier of materials research to graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, a laboratory-based discovery process is designed to reach out to high school students through a summer internship program.<br/><br/>Technical description:   The introduction of semiconductor heterostructures enabled many novel designs of electronics and photonics, leading to transformative semiconductor technologies. The recent emergence of atomically thin crystalline two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors creates exciting new opportunities for pushing semiconductor heterostructures towards a new frontier.  In particular, vertically stacked van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures were quickly recognized as a powerful platform for creating atomically thin heterostructures with great design flexibility.  A central scientific issue is the role of interlayer coupling, which can alter the electronic structures of each vdW layer individually, and the stack as a whole.  This project systematically investigates how interlayer atomic alignment impacts the electronic structure of vdW heterostructures. Moreover, using interlayer coupling as the design parameter, the research creates a sequence of 2D electronic superlattices with novel electronic and photonic properties. Scientifically, activities provide researchers in the field with important design parameters to tailor the electronic and photonic structures of vdW heterostructures. Technologically, the new generation of electronic and photonic materials and devices driven by this new line of research have important applications that benefit society. Educationally, graduate students trained through this study gain a broad scientific perspective. Through the design of a special course, the PI continues to enhance campus-wide graduate/undergraduate education in nanoscience and nanotechnology.

The audio feed will be paralleled with visual representation, allowing the user instant access to expanded information. The human ear is superior to the eye for processing certain kinds of information, especially information that changes over time. As an alternative or complement to visual analysis, audio perception can process data in temporal, spatial, amplitude, and frequency resolution.

In living societies, increasing settlement and population density can be accompanied by greater exposure and susceptibility to dangerous infectious diseases, social inequality, unsanitary living conditions, and unstable food supplies.  Paleodemography; the study of human populations in the archaeological past based on skeletal remains - can provide important insights into the complex relationships between people, their social and physical environments, and their diseases even in the absence of written historical records.  This project will investigate the effects of urbanization on human health and the risk of death in medieval Denmark (c. AD 1050-1536) to disentangle the social and biological influences on human health in changing populations.  In paleodemography, ""frailty"" is defined as an individual's age-adjusted risk of death.  Frailty can vary owing to individual differences in susceptibility to disease and death that may have underlying genetic, social, or environmental causes.  New statistical analyses of skeletal samples from medieval Denmark will be used to determine how patterns of variation in frailty and risk of death in the past differed as a result of increased urbanization during the medieval period.  This project will inform us about the role of urbanization in past preindustrial populations that dealt with the same illnesses and conditions that continue to influence people today, and as such will provide insight into how to avoid emerging health risks.  Broader impacts of this study include museum exhibitions, public science outreach efforts (particularly aimed at promoting the role of women in scientific research), and continued international collaborations.<br/><br/>This dissertation project brings together established paleodemographic approaches and a new model of frailty, along with newly-developed statistical methods, to investigate the relationship between childhood and adult frailty and the risk of death from skeletal data in order to determine the effects of urbanization on age-at-death distributions from medieval Denmark.  Skeletal remains from the Ole Wormsgade urban cemetery, Sejet rural parish cemetery, and the monastic cemetery of Om Kloster, which represent samples of the people who occupied the area in and near the medieval port city of Horsens on the eastern coast of Jutland, Denmark, will be examined.  These samples will be analyzed to determine: (1) how frailty and age-at-death patterns differed as a result of urbanization over the medieval period, (2) how males and females were affected differently by their social and physical environments within and across the three samples, and (3) what the relationship was between childhood frailty and resulting adult frailty and mortality.  These goals will be met by estimating disease prevalence and the associated risk of death in relation to boney indicators of childhood stress, infection, and malnutrition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, fundamental insights to the dopants effect on emerging materials provide a versatile kit to radically tailor the material properties to best fit in their desired practical applications and even lead to discovery of new materials and applications. As a game-changing player in the field of photovoltaics, organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites materials (HPM) has exhibited impressive photovoltaic efficiency. However, HPM still suffer from major challenges including chemical instability and lead toxicity due to: (i) hydration effects, leading to structural failure and (ii) formation of vacancy defects, leading to poor carrier lifetime. In this project, the research team aims to understand the various dopants in HPM and to pursue their synergistic effect towards stable HPM based on fundamental chemical principles. Meanwhile, as an effective way to train the next generation of scientists, the team aims to work with the nearby world-class research facilities at Argonne National Laboratory through existing collaborations with Argonne scientists such that both graduate and undergraduate students with wide diversities can be involved in frontline research projects at their young age, and trained with skills in cutting-edge facilities, interdisciplinary knowledge, critical thinking, problem solving, and team work. <br/><br/>Technical Description: The project has a two-fold objective, namely to establish the relationship between dopants (type, amount and location) and the chemical stability of the HPM while minimizing the loss in PV performance; and to provide an atomic level understanding of how the proposed dopants stabilize the vulnerable ions in HPM and affect their PV performance. A synergistic co-doping of both cations and anions is conducted to study their effect on the overall chemical stability. The team is also exploring the interplay between charge-isotropic cationic dopants and multivalent anionic dopants, which are hypothesized to enhance electrostatic coupling between the cationic and anionic parts in HPM, and thus enabling greater rigidity of the overall perovskite structure. The research involves the use of dopants capable of forming strong hydrogen bonding at the atomic level gateway of the perovskite structure to effectively block the ingression of water molecules. Furthermore, the research also involves the use of selected reducing dopants to suppress oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in Sn-based HPM, based on understanding of what and how reductants can retard the oxidation of Sn2+. Additionally, a high pressure technique is used to minimize the Sn2+ vacancy defects in Sn-based HPM. By prudently designing the type, amount and location of the dopants towards minimal loss in PV efficiency and maximal stability enhancement benefited from the dopants, the ultimate research goal is to provide a clear path to atomically reinforced structure of HPM using dopants as the stabilizing rivets in order to achieve stable and lead-free perovskite solar cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the great mysteries of our world is how myriad forms of life grow and develop from a single cell into a new organism.  The sequence of developmental events is surprisingly robust, even though the biological processes emerge from a complex interplay between genetic programming and environmental inputs that can be quite variable.  The revolution in ""omics"" and high-throughput analysis has uncovered associations in this process, but the causal mechanisms remain unknown.  The research at the Center seeks to understand the underlying biological mechanisms and principles associated with these remarkable phenomena.  The Center focuses on four interrelated research areas selected to elucidate distinct aspects of growth and development.  Each project integrates hypothesis-driven mathematical modeling and data-driven mathematical analysis with advanced imaging, genomics, and metabolomics tools to explore biological processes across time, space, and extrinsic variables.  Graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral trainees will be embedded in shared mathematical and biological environments, engaged in work with investigators across this multi-disciplinary spectrum.  The Center will build interdisciplinary capacity through a visiting scholars program, a named fellows program, a pilot project program, a middle-school science club learning module, workshops, and training courses.  It will advance knowledge in the biological and mathematical sciences, generate new conceptual models explaining development and growth, and train new investigators who are experienced in both fields.<br/><br/>The NSF-Simons Center for Quantitative Biology aims to transform understanding of organismal growth and development through quantitative approaches that combine three fundamental mathematical areas: dynamical systems theory, stochastic processes, and dimension reduction.  The Center also intends to make substantial technical advances in quantitative approaches, by producing new high-dimensional biological datasets across spatial (cellular to organismal) and temporal scales, new conceptual models of diverse developmental processes, and mathematical models that describe developmental emergence.  Project 1 will produce single-cell RNA-sequence data from a frog embryo and mouse embryonic stem cells at various stages during development and new conceptual models of embryogenesis using dynamical systems theory and statistical dimension reduction.  The high-dimensional approach and datasets from Project 2 will enable a new mathematical model of roundworm growth as a function of genotype and environmental variables.  Project 3 will provide a new overarching conceptual model of environmentally-driven oscillatory dynamics in the fruit fly and unique datasets that link molecular signatures in the fat body of the fly with phenotypic behavior.  The image analysis of Project 4 will study stochastic variation in fruit fly development and generate a new mathematical model of the impact of protein expression noise on development processes.  Across projects, new statistical methodologies and methods for combining multiple types of mathematical approaches will be tested and validated.  New biological datasets, conceptual models, and mathematical models will be made available to the broader research community.  The Center will promote interdisciplinary education and workforce training at the intersection of mathematical sciences and biology, scientific outreach to the underserved K-12 education community, and interdisciplinary training for visiting scholars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these languages increase the developers' productivity and allow them to create software for novel devices, they also have the distinct disadvantage of not checking enough safety properties upfront. Failures show up once the software is deployed and may hurt customers.  Researchers have recently addressed this problem with the creation of hybrid languages, which embrace rapid production and a way to add safety checks gradually, while industrial developers have developed hybrid languages that omit safety entirely. The project's novelties are about the performance of these hybrid languages, which, as recently discovered, prevent their adoption. If successful, the project's impacts are likely to change the landscape of modern software development on a large scale, adding safety to the most common modern approach to rapid software production.<br/><br/>The research project addresses the specific problem of improving the performance of these hybrid languages. While prior research demonstrates that hybrid programming languages are indeed the flexible medium that software developers may want, it also reveals significant performance problems with these languages. The project therefore explores four different ideas of how to eliminate these performance bottlenecks: (1) principled relaxation of the safety guarantees; (2) compiler technology specifically tuned to the additional safety checks; (3) reduction of memory needed for these checks; and (4) application of software verification technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project looks at specific demographic attributes in the STEM faculty hiring process at the University of California, but the results will apply to hiring more broadly, both within and outside of the academy.  Finding the hypothesized effect of networks will constitute an important advance because this is a hidden source of bias that would be present even if more direct biases could be eliminated.

It uses these data to test hypotheses about the influence of network connections on hiring processes and how networks work to reinforce inequalities by key demographic attributes in the academic labor market.  To accomplish these goals the researchers will enhance the Evaluating Equity in Faculty Recruitment (EEFR) data, which includes detailed measures of the faculty hiring process, by adding multiple measures of the person-to-person ties between individuals involved in the faculty hiring processes. Three kinds of individual-level network connections between the actors in the hiring network are measured, those indicated by co-authorship relationships, by direct citation of scholar's work, and by indirect citation, i.e., the extent to which the authors cite similar bodies of literature. Multivariate statistical analyses examine the effects of network connections in formal hiring processes by testing the presence, extent, and correlates of differences by demographic attribute in professional networks and by identifying the influence of network connections on individual outcomes in STEM faculty hiring.

As two examples, flow predictions are key to limiting damage of hurricanes to human life and to the economy (the latter estimated to be hundreds of billions of dollars in 2017) and to energy efficiency optimization (85% of US energy is generated by combustion for which accurate simulation of turbulent mixing is critical). Unfortunately, fundamental barriers to accurate, efficient and reliable prediction of fluid flow exist in these and other applications addressed in the proposed research. Accurate prediction with uncertain data requires reliable and efficient ensemble simulations. The cost of current methods limits prediction accuracy by limiting ensemble sizes. Further improvement requires new computational tools with a fundamental decrease in simulation cost and memory requirements. Algorithms which address these needs will be developed in this project. <br/><br/>Artificial compression methods are by far the most efficient per time step but little used due to low time accuracy, restrictive time step conditions, stability problems, ill-conditioning and nonphysical acoustic waves. Their resolution will resurrect artificial compression methods into accurate, reliable and efficient methods for the prediction of fluid motion, expanding ensemble simulations and coupled flow prediction markedly beyond their current limitations. Artificial compression methods exhibit parasitic pressure waves that become resonant at higher Reynolds numbers. This research will develop a method dependent Lighthill theory of flow generated sound and apply it to design time filters to suppress parasitic acoustics. Time accuracy will be achieved by development of a new family of variable step, variable order methods. Variable step, variable order method have proven to be the most efficient, accurate and reliable methods to solve smaller systems of ordinary differential equations.  However, previous variable step, variable order methods have limited penetration into computational fluid dynamics practice due partially to their implementation complexity and increased cost per step. The new methods have (to leading order) the same cognitive and computational complexity as the fully implicit method. Uncoupling of velocity and pressure in artificial compression methods introduces an extra grad-div term in the velocity solve, decreasing sparsity and increasing ill conditioning. Thus, the efficiency of artificial compression methods is lost with increased storage and solver cost per step. The research will develop a new realization, modular Grad-Div, reducing storage and turnaround time by a factor of 30 in preliminary tests. While each development has independent interest, they will be integrated into an ensemble, artificial compression method and tested on problems of compelling interest. The proposed research develops expertise of PhD students in analysis, numerical analysis and application areas while working on compelling mathematics problems of broad impact advancing the accurate prediction of fluid motion. It is carefully integrated with the development of the PI's PhD students and undergraduate researchers.

Stability and accuracy properties of numerical methods will be investigated using non-Newtonian fluid and poroelastic/elastic structure models. The theoretical investigation will provide a solid foundation and guidance to the further development of numerical algorithms.  Because of the many important biological and engineering processes involving non-Newtonian fluid flows, there is a great demand for mathematical support in these applications. This research will provide an underlying mathematical foundation for non-Newtonian flows in a multiphysical setting.<br/> <br/> <br/>The technical goal of this project is to develop algorithms and analyze numerical schemes for two coupled systems: (a) quasi-Newtoinan fluid - poroelastic structure and (b) viscoelastic fluid - elastic structure. For system (a) the PI will focus on the development and analysis of a nonlinear operator, where a solution to the operator equation yields subsystem solutions satisfying interface conditions of the whole coupled system. Advantages of this approach over the previously developed optimization approach are the flexibility to choose a nonlinear solver and that no extra coding effort is needed as the adjoint system is no longer involved in a solution process. Since it is expected that the linearized operator is not self-adjoint, the linear operator equation should be solved by an iterative solver for a non-self-adjoint problem. When a partitioned scheme is considered for simulating viscoelastic FSI, extra difficulty is encountered due to the lack of information on the stress along the moving boundary and movement of inlet and outlet boundaries along the interface of two subsystems. The PI will investigate various choices for a stress boundary value and their effect on a solution of FSI.  Another issue with the viscoelastic FSI is the size of the fluid problem to be solved in each time step (or in each internal iteration), which may require an operator splitting based on a temporal discretization scheme such as a fractional time step method. To tackle this, the PI will investigate various time stepping schemes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project utilizes an electrochemical conversion with carbon dioxide as a feedstock and an externally applied electrical potential (voltage) to produce higher valued chemicals as a goal. The researchers will investigate how to engineer the application of the electrochemical potential to the device in order to improve the yield of products such as ethylene in an energy efficient manner.

The goal is that application of a series of voltage pulses and varying its frequency and energy magnitude could tune the reactions occurring to favor production of hydrocarbons over competing products such as carbon monoxide. For educational broader impacts, the PIs will continue their commitment to fostering undergraduate researchers through summer and academic year research projects. The PIs will continue to sponsor a research ethics workshop for researchers in energy and materials designed for both students and senior investigators.

This project seeks to control these variables by tuning the temporal profile of the electrochemical potential pulse. The central focus is to identify the principles for designing the temporal profile of the electrochemical potential to promote hydrocarbon production and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition to selectivity control, the temporal control of the electrochemical potential represents an opportunity to address open questions concerning competing pathways in the carbon dioxide electroreduction and their rate constants.

Since its inception in 1980s there were discovered many new connections of symplectic topology with other areas of Mathematics and Physics. The primary techniques used in the subject go back to Gromov's theory of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds and its many ramifications, such as Floer homology, Fukaya categories and Symplectic Field Theory. However, there remains  a large class of open problems where holomorphic curve techniques seems not to be sufficient for proving expected results. The current project attempts to develop alternative techniques, or in case they do not exist to develop new methods of  construction  which could show that everything which is not prohibited by holomorphic curve techniques  can indeed happen. In particular, it provides a reformulation of symplectic topology of affine symplectic manifolds  as   differential topology of  singular spaces  with a certain well defined list of singularities. This approach can bring new tools from  differential to symplectic topology.<br/><br/>Weinstein symplectic manifolds recently  moved to the forefront of the development of symplectic and contact topology. Building on recent developments, both on the rigid and flexible side of symplectic topology of Weinstein manifolds,  the  project is designed to advance several central problems of the theory, such as symplectic topology of Lagrangian submanifolds.  Among the  main objectives of the project are: exploration of  techniques for simplification of singularities of Lagrangian skeleta of Weinstein manifolds, and in particular for  proving exploration of methods for attacking the regularity conjecture for exact Lagrangian submanifolds of Weinstein manifolds; exploration of  a new approach to singularity theory: h-principle without pre-conditions; further exploration of flexibility phenomena  for Weinstein manifolds and their Lagrangian submanifolds; and further development of Symplectic Field Theory. The project is designed to bridge the gap between the negative results establishing limits for possible symplectic constructions, and positive results involving the advanced symplectic constructions on the frontier of possibilities. The new methods  developed for the arborealization project may find applications elsewhere in singularity theory. The work on the project will involve several graduate students and postdocs and there will be written a graduate student level book devoted to new advances in symplectic flexibility.

This project aims to use modern techniques from optimal control theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, and nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization to address these questions.

Investigation of the existence of an optimal control, differentiability of the coupled nonlinear system, and derivation of optimality conditions promises to launch new directions in nonlinear control, nonconvex optimization, and nonsmooth analysis of semi-dissipative systems. It will also contribute to the development of effective computational methods.

The team is using state-wide media to increase awareness of how fundamental catalysis research impacts economically important industries, both present and future.<br/><br/>	With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, a collaborative team from Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma is using an interdisciplinary synthesis, characterization, simulation, and reaction analysis approach to determine to whether or not water actively influences reactions in solid acid catalysts.   Drs. White, Resasco, and Crossley, are engaged in tailored synthesis of zeolites, post-synthetic modifications of zeolites, in-situ spectroscopic NMR measurements, and reactor studies at varying temperature and pressure to determine how catalyst structure responds to the presence of both gas-phase and liquid-phase water.  Dr. Wang is providing DFT (density functional theory) and MD (molecular dynamics) calculations to help the team elucidate probable reaction pathways.  Conversion of both non-polar hydrocarbons derived for traditional petroleum sources as well as oxygenated molecules derived from biomass are under investigation. Also under investigation is the role of small populations of highly-active ?defect? catalytic sites in the absence and presence of water  The team is advancing inclusion of under-represented groups in STEM disciplines through programs on each campus, and increasing public awareness of the benefit of catalysis through public media outlets at the university and state level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Confocal microscopy instruments are widely used in academia and industry but do not provide mechanical information of samples; mechanical testing instruments are also ubiquitous in both academia and industry but are contact-based. This project brings the non-contact mechanical testing capability to optical microscopy instruments. Beyond enabling traditional material characterizations with high spatio-temporal resolution, the instrument will be highly impactful in biomedical research. The past two decades have seen increasing recognition of the prominent role of the mechanical interplay between cells and their local microenvironment to regulate cell function. A widely utilized optical microscope for cell biomechanics would accelerate our understanding of mechano-chemical pathways and their role in the control of biological processes. Thus, this instrument is expected to be broadly used by biomedical researchers and material scientists in industry and academia to access cell, tissue and biomaterial mechanical properties without perturbing the sample and with high 3D resolution.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project explores the commercialization of an add-on module for confocal microscopes that features novel Brillouin spectroscopy.  Brillouin spectroscopy has been widely used for material testing and environmental sensing since the 1970's using specialized spectrometers that required 10 min to hours for a single measurement. In recent years, a new type of spectrometer was developed to improve speed of acquisition by several orders of magnitude and allowed to obtain 3D elasticity maps of biomaterials, biological cells and tissues. Thanks to the integration in commercial confocal microscopes, several highly impactful areas (e.g. stem cell lineage differentiation, malignancy transformation) will benefit from this technology as it enables gathering biomechanical information in environments and settings such as 3D microenvironments that mimic the in vivo conditions.  In addition, the instrument will enable the study of cell biomechanics on microfluidic platforms in order to control microenvironment conditions. Being compatible with traditional optical microscopes, this technology can also be combined with force mapping modalities thus enabling to investigate how cells sense mechanical stimuli and transduce them into biochemical signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed activity aims at investigating the evolution of systems with complex interactions, such as particles moving in a disordered environment, cars navigating their way through traffic, the surface of a growing crystal, or the boundary of an infected tissue. Complexity is captured by the randomness in the model, both in the environment in which the particles interact or the crystal grows, and in the interaction or growth process itself. The aim of the project is to develop the mathematical laws that govern such systems. To have a very simple example in mind, one can think of how the fraction of Heads in a large number of tosses of a coin will converge to the probability of getting Heads in one toss. (The mathematical law behind this basic phenomenon is known as the Law of Large Numbers.) Besides its impact on probability theory and mathematics in general, the proposed activity is expected to have a direct impact on the understanding of many physical systems involving random motion in random or disordered media. Understanding complex interactions has wide implications for science and engineering and thereby for society.<br/><br/>The proposed activity is on the subject of random motion in random media. Models in this field have been intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers. Their importance arises from rigorous mathematical connections to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, and the KPZ universality class. The PI has already established energy-entropy duality and produced solutions to these variational formulas in terms of Busemann functions. In particular, the PI proved almost sure existence of Busemann functions for the growth model with general weight distribution.

These objects play a central role in general relativity where gravitation is reflected by the curvature of space-time. Geometric objects can often be improved if we evolve them by a differential equation, so that the curvature dissipates in a way analogous to heat dissipation. However, one important difference is that, while heat dissipation is a linear phenomenon, all the geometrically interesting equations are nonlinear. This project is aimed at understanding these nonlinear phenomena. Of particular interest is the process of singularity formation: That is to say, what happens when a surface is about to break apart and the curvature becomes very large? Understanding these questions is an important problem within mathematics. In addition, discrete versions of these equations are used in engineering and computer science.<br/><br/>The most important example of a geometric evolution equation is Hamilton's Ricci flow, which is a key tool in Perelman's proof of the Poincare and Geometrization conjectures, as well as in the proof of the Sphere Theorem. Another important example is the mean curvature flow for surfaces in Euclidean space. One of the main concept is that of an ancient solutions.Ancient solutions are solutions which can be extended infinitely far backward in time.They oftenarise as models for a solution to a geometric flow right before a singularity forms. As such, they play an important role in understanding singularity formation.One of the goals here is to classify all ancient solutions in low dimensions, subject to a noncollapsing assumption. This is analogous to the problem of classifying entire solutions to elliptic equations. The PI is also planning to study singularity formation in higher dimensions, under suitable curvature restrictions.In another direction, the PIis interested in studying problems related to minimal surfaces and free boundary value problems, as well as applications of partial differential equations to general relativity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rare earth elements are not mined, processed or traded in large quantities. Over 90% of the world's supply of these metals is controlled by foreign countries. Recent export restrictions have interrupted the supply of these metals to the United States, and raised concerns about their continued use in military and energy sectors. Recovery, separation, recycle, and reuse of these rare earth elements is thus critical. However, these metals are often found closely intermingled - and thus difficult to separate from - other 'like' metals. Two rare earth elements, neodymium and dysprosium, can be recovered from discarded iron magnets using solvents. Solvent extraction can be hazardous, expensive, time and labor intensive, and ineffective when the metals are found in low concentration. This project will develop a novel material that will selectively recover low concentrations of neodymium and dysprosium from iron without the use of solvents. <br/><br/>This project will develop DNA-grafted mesoporous carbon to selectively recover neodymium and dysprosium from iron. The high concentration of oxygen and phosphorous on the DNA molecules will increase the selective affinity for these metals, concentrating them on the solid substrate. The mesoporous carbon will provide a high number of surface sites per gram of material to facilitate the recovery. The exploratory project will covalently graft specific nucleotide units on the mesopore carbon surface, explore the penetration of the nucleotides into the pores, determine material stability, and test the materials for both non-competitive and competitive adsorption of neodymium, dysprosium, and iron. The anticipated outcome is a series of highly tunable and stable DNA grafted carbons that can substantially enhance the uptake and recovery of neodymium and dysprosium compared to currently available materials. It is anticipated that the tunable phosphorous and oxygen content of DNA grafted carbon will have additional applications in chemical separations, sensing, fluoresce, or molecular electronics. The project will support both undergraduate and masters-level research students, incorporate the research into the undergraduate engineering curriculum, and presented the concepts to high school students at an engineering summer camp.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While one can create a mathematical model for these processes, the large number of parameters in the model inhibits the use of traditional computational tools for fast and reliable predictions. In addition, there is the question of the efficacy of the mathematical model. The proposed research puts forward new mathematical ideas, based primarily on model reduction, to determine the importance of the various parameters and derive simpler models that still faithfully describe the underlying process. This, in turn, leads to more accurate and less costly computational models that can be implemented within today's existing  computing resources.  The project also investigates how to quantify uncertainty in both the model and the parameters from data observations of the process.<br/><br/>This project investigates three demanding computational tasks in parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). The first of these, called the forward problem, seeks the creation of fast and accurate online solvers for the PDE when given a parameter query. Such online solvers are used in a myriad of applications that seek to optimize performance through parameter selection. The second seeks optimal methods to compute the state of the PDE from observational data. Related to this is the third problem of estimating the parameters of the PDE from observational data. Because of the large number of parameters, traditional numerical methods for such high dimensional problems face the so-called ""curse of dimensionality"", i.e., they cannot obtain the desired accuracy of computation in a reasonable computational time. The proposed research circumvents this difficulty by developing novel methods of model reduction based on sparsity ad highly nonlinear approximation such as n-term dictionary approximation. Foundational results will also be established for inverse parameter estimation that prove Lipschitz smoothness for the forward and inverse maps under minimal smoothness conditions on the parameters. These foundational results are then coupled with reduced modeling to create numerical methods for parameter estimation and model verification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Environmental microbial communities provide essential functions, including the cycling of key resources like carbon and nitrogen. In soils, microorganisms form diverse communities with thousands of distinct species, but the role of most of these species is unknown. In particular, it is not clear how microbial species that are not very abundant (rare) contribute to community functions. However, rare microorganisms are thought to be important when environmental conditions fluctuate because they provide functions that help their ecosystem resist change or to recover quickly. This project will investigate the diversity and functions of rare microorganisms in a soil ecosystem impacted by a long-term disturbance, and determine how they contribute to the system's resilience to this disturbance. The research will provide insights into the critical role of microbial diversity for environmental resilience, which has implications for broad national interests in energy and food security, environmental conservation and remediation, and the management of ecosystem services. The project will advance the fields of ecology and ecosystem science by investigating the links between microbial diversity and functions in the environment. It also will benefit society by providing classroom education in quantitative methods and training members of the scientific workforce in leading-edge technologies used in biology and chemistry.<br/><br/>The three aims of this research are to: 1) quantify the contributions of rare microbial taxa to community stability after a long-term environmental disturbance; 2) evaluate the abilities of rare microbial taxa to a) persist given disturbance and b) respond to specific environmental changes that result from the disturbance; and 3) determine the impact of competition between rare and abundant microbial taxa on community stability and functions. The Centralia, Pennsylvania soil ecosystem is the site of a long-burning coal seam fire that will serve a model severe disturbance for this work. For Aims 1 and 2, surface soils will be collected annually from established sites along a fire-impact gradient so that community changes over time due to the influence of fire can be quantified. Soil microbial communities will be assessed using genetic markers of phylogenetic and functional diversity obtained from untargeted DNA and RNA sequencing. Rare microbial taxa will be identified using bioinformatics and their contributions to community stability will be quantified with ecological statistics. For Aim 3, bacteria isolated from field soils will be arrayed into synthetic microbial communities to assess outcomes of competition between rare and abundant microorganisms. Microbial community ""goods"", which include small, excreted molecules like enzymes and antibiotics, will be measured using sensitive mass spectrometry to determine how competition impacts their production. Together, these efforts will provide insights into the ecological roles of rare microbial taxa, and microbial biodiversity more broadly, for community stability and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the project is to develop a new type of microscope with unprecedented space and time resolution. The Landes group's new microscope allows the study of how rare events impact the efficiency of porous materials that are important for catalysis, separations science, corrosion, and biology. It has been established that it is possible to manipulate light as it interacts with molecules and proteins. For example, Professor Landes has already shown that by shaping light's phase, events faster than the camera frame rate can be imaged. By incorporating new mathematical and physical tools, the current project will result in a new instrument to image and track fast dynamics in porous materials with optimized 3-D space and time resolution. The interdisciplinary nature of this research effort provides participating students with a unique experience at the interface of spectroscopy and materials science, as well as image processing and modern information theory, and continues the strong history of cross-disciplinary activities in science and technology at Rice University. This grant supports Professor Landes to provide training opportunities to high school teachers to incorporate cutting edge science into their course materials, as well as her new effort to create a summer scientific programming course. <br/><br/>Recently, a new microscopy technique called super temporal-resolved microscopy (STREM) was developed. Proof-of-concept measurements showed that STREM can improve the time resolution of traditional wide-field cameras by at least twenty times. This development, if combined with recent advances in 3-D imaging methods and signal processing, represents an opportunity to resolve the multiscale, nonlinear dynamics that drive a range of interfacial materials properties. Thus, the current project's objective is to develop and optimize 4-D STREM, a chemical imaging method for quantifying the nonlinear dynamics and structures in porous materials. It is hypothesized that better 3-D sub-diffraction spatial information, coupled with improved time resolution and signal processing algorithms, reveals heterogeneous mass transport, chemical, and biological mechanisms occurring at porous interfaces. The project will involve innovations in both hardware and software to improve the temporal and 2-D spatial resolution. Additionally, a new algorithm is to be developed to track in 3-D. Finally, the new microscope is to be used to acquire and curate a machine learning library capable of differentiating among common analyte, sample, and instrument conditions. A new instrument optimized for characterizing the multiscalar physics and chemistry that underlie separations in porous media, by improving both spatial and temporal resolution is obtained in this project. Further, the project will result in new algorithms to extract information from large 3-D data sets. In terms of applications, a more detailed description of mass transport in pores and channels is a step towards predictive separations, which are currently optimized empirically, amounting to billions of dollars each year for industry, government, and academic purposes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental components of an HMM include the noisy observations and the corresponding hidden states. In most applications, the number of hidden states (the order of the HMM) is not known beforehand but conveys important information about the underlying process. For example, in molecular biology, the total number of hidden states may be the number of distinct 3D conformations of a protein; in chemistry, the total number of hidden states may be the number of distinct chemical species in an organic reaction. This project plans to investigate order determination for HMMs, finite mixture models, and hierarchical HMMs; the latter two models are special cases and extensions of HMMs. The project aims to develop a consistent and competitive method for order selection. In addition to a thorough theoretical investigation, comprehensive numerical studies and applications in biology and chemistry will be conducted. The project will not only significantly advance the theoretical understanding of HMMs, but also provide powerful tools for researchers to analyze data. The data applications will help advance molecular biology and biochemistry.

Finite mixture models can be reformulated as special types of HMMs. The goal is to develop a method for consistently estimating the number of mixture components. (3) Investigate order determination of hierarchical HMMs, where multiple HMMs are linked through a hierarchical structure.

Its fundamental purpose is to examine and gather initial validity evidence for assessments designed to measure and build Kindergarten-fifth grade science teachers' content knowledge for teaching (CKT) about matter and its interactions in teacher education settings. The selection of this topic will facilitate the development of a proof-of-concept to determine if and how CKT assessments can be developed and used to measure and build elementary teachers' CKT. Also, it will facilitate rapid and targeted refinement of an evidence-centered design process that could be applied to other science topics. Plans are to integrate CKT assessments and related resources into teacher education courses to support the ability of teachers to apply their content knowledge to the work of teaching and learning science. The project will combine efforts from prior projects and engage in foundational research to examine the nature of teachers' CKT and to build theories and hypotheses about the productive use and design of CKT assessment materials to support formative and summative uses. Likewise, the project will create a set of descriptive cases highlighting the use of these tools. Understanding how CKT science assessments can be leveraged as summative tools to evaluate current efforts, and as formative tools to build elementary teachers' specialized, practice-based knowledge will be the central foci of this effort. <br/><br/>The main research questions will be: (1) What is the nature of elementary science teachers' CKT about matter and its interactions?; and (2) How can the development of prospective elementary teachers' CKT be supported within teacher education? To address the research questions, the study will employ a mixed-methods, design-based research approach to gather various sources of validity evidence to support the formative and summative use of the CKT instrument, instructional tasks, and supporting materials. The project will be organized around two main research and development strands. Strand One will build an empirically grounded understanding of the nature of elementary teachers' CKT. Strand Two will focus on developing and studying how CKT instructional tasks can be used formatively within teacher education settings to build elementary teachers' CKT. In addition, the project will refine a conceptual framework that identifies the science-specific teaching practices that comprise the work of teaching science. This will be used as well to assess the CKT that teachers leverage when recognizing, understanding, and responding to the content-intensive practices that they engage in as they teach science. To that end, the study will build on two existing frameworks from prior NSF-funded work. The first was originally developed to create CKT assessments for elementary and middle school teachers in English Language Arts and mathematics. The second focuses on the content challenges that novice elementary science teachers face. It is organized by the instructional tools and practices that elementary science teachers use, such as scientific models and explanations. These instructional practices cut across those addressed in the Next Generation Science Standards' (NGSS; Lead States, 2013) disciplinary strands. The main project's outcomes will be knowledge that builds and refines theories about the nature of elementary teachers' CKT, and how CKT elementary science assessment materials can be designed productively for formative and summative purposes. The project will also result in the development of a suite of valid and reliable assessments that afford interpretations on CKT matter proficiency and can be used to monitor elementary teachers learning.

Specifically, existing in-home robots could assist a broader cohort of elderly users if the robots were easier to understand and use.  This is an especially timely opportunity as the elderly population is quickly growing in the United States. Elderly users need a robot that can express many internal states through external features, especially in an intuitive and interactive way. Choreographers and theater artists recognize how to convey narrative through context (set), movement (choreography), and commands (dialogue), therefore bringing a special expertise beyond typical product design processes.  Marrying this expertise with robotic hardware development has the potential to produce a significant transformation in how aging adults relate to and take advantage of technology in their homes.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial potential of a three-part design methodology that has been developed to layer robotic systems with greater expressiveness and understandable features. This method 1) creates systems with appropriate expressive bandwidth to communicate internal state to human viewers through motion profiles, 2) helps users understand how to interact with robotic systems through character-driven narrative, and 3) predicts affective responses to these systems, across multiple contexts. Initial results indicate that trust and acceptance of in-home technology can be facilitated with low-cost, simple hardware like LEDs, off-the-shelf servo motors, improved how-to literature, and context-based behavior, with existing, low-cost robot hardware. For example, something as simple as a heart rate monitor has opaque, hard to interpret monitors, confusing multiple-step procedures, and an ominous beeping. This novel approach adds a customizable expressive layer to an existing device like this, creates a character-driven narrative about how the device works, and uses theatrical context which may improve user adoption via priming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Shale gas is mostly methane, which is difficult to transport and of relatively low value. The conversion of methane into higher value products, such as methanol, requires new and improved catalytic processes. Methanol is a platform chemical, with existing technologies for transforming it into a variety of useful, important products. Metal exchanged zeolites are a class of materials showing great promise as catalysts for transforming methane to methanol. However, how these catalysts work is not yet well-understood. Further, their catalytic performance depends on many complex parameters which are difficult to optimize. In this project, Dr. Mavrikakis of the University of Wisconsin is using both theory and experiments to understand the performance of one specific zeolite structure, known as SSZ-13, for the conversion of methane to methanol. His work is developing a correlation between zeolite synthesis conditions and the resulting chemical composition of SSZ-13, and between its catalytic performance and reaction conditions. The insights gained are being used to design experimental synthesis protocol to produce the ideal zeolite catalyst and reaction conditions for methane conversion to methanol. During this project Dr. Mavrikakis is informing the public about the importance of theoretical modeling in fundamental and industrial research and practice. Dr. Mavrikakis is also educating undergraduate students about communicating science to middle school and high school students, as well as providing internships to undergraduate students to conduct research in his group.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Mavrikakis at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is applying a combined theoretical/experimental approach for understanding the fundamentals of converting methane to methanol using transition metal exchanged SSZ-13 zeolite. This includes: (i) first-principles modeling of zeolite synthesis through the development of correlations between synthesis parameters, such as the identity of template and ions present, and the obtained zeolite structure, such as the local Al distribution and defect density; (ii) the ab-initio calculation of phase diagrams for different transition metals (Cu, Fe, Co, Ni) and types of active sites for a wide range of operating conditions, and (iii) the calculation of reaction pathways for the most stable active catalytic sites. In a subsequent step, this information is being used to develop a protocol for the experimental synthesis, elemental composition and reaction conditions for maximized performance of the ideal metal exchanged SSZ-13 zeolite for the conversion of methane to methanol. In parallel, and in collaboration with the Wisconsin Institute for Chemical Education, Dr. Mavrikakis' group is developing modules to teach undergraduate and middle school students how thinking at the molecular level can lead to new powerful technologies.

Even milder head impacts require patient monitoring, though for how long is not completely known.  To care for people with less obvious injuries and to measure whether a patient has healed, new approaches to brain imaging are needed.  This research is targeted at improving the prediction and monitoring of brain injuries.  A loss of white matter is one of the changes in brain tissue after injury. How the head impact is distributed as stress in the brain is not known, nor do we know the tolerance of brain cells to stress. This research project will use fast confocal microscopy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques to develop and validate a multiscale mechanical model for brain white matter that can predict cell injury.  This validated model will be used to estimate axonal injury in the brain using impact models of the whole brain.  The research will be used in the education of undergraduate and graduate students.  The PI instituted the GirlsConnect club in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering to increase the participation and retention of women in this field.<br/><br/>This project will focus on identifying the injury thresholds for individual axons within white matter when the tissue is exposed to dynamic, mechanical stretch. This interdisciplinary research builds on the innovative experimental approaches to understand axon kinematics and novel multi-scale computational models of the collaborative team to introduce: (i) Analysis of axon-level displacements and sub-failure axonal damage following clinically-relevant, dynamic loading of white matter; (ii) Computational incorporation of the composite mechanics of axon and glial matrix interaction, including damage, into the global (macro) response of the white matter following tissue-scale loading; (iii) Quantitative prediction of stress concentrations at the axon-level from the computational models; and (iv) Integration of clinical imaging (MRI and Magnetic Resonance Elastography) and subsequent histopathology and correlation of mechanical properties to axonal damage. The multi-scale model will enable the prediction of changes in bulk mechanical properties from damage to the axonal microstructure and from myelin degeneration.

The project will also study theoretically the statistical performance of some methods for deterministic approximate inference popular in machine learning, but for which little attention has been given to properties such as consistency, asymptotic normality and efficiency.  The study will begin with concrete examples in the realm of generalized linear mixed models, from a frequentist perspective, and seek to establish first-of-kind results for asymptotic efficiency of Expectation Propagation.  Finally, the project will study approximate inference for the eigenstructure of highly multivariate models with low dimensional structure.  It will adapt James' classical framework for multivariate analysis to a broad class of multispike models.

The emerging ability to make semiconductor materials sufficiently small such that varying their size and shape drastically alters their optical and electrical properties is paving new paths to improving device efficiencies and, more importantly, imparting them with new capabilities. This project examines and improves on such semiconductors that can be synthesized and processed by relatively simple means, using chemical solutions. These materials can enable new or multiple functions in devices, for example, allowing a pixel in a display screen to not only emit but also sense light. Such a capability may in turn simplify the design and manufacturing of electronics such as smart phones and tablets, to imbue them with multiple new functionalities while reducing their size, weight, and energy consumption. Multi-faceted challenges to be tackled here provide ample educational and training opportunities for the students involved, helping them be better prepared to become leaders in interdisciplinary science and engineering fields. The PI is committed to building on the research results of this project to enhance teaching and promote benefits of emerging science and technologies to the general public.<br/><br/>Technical Description: Colloidal quantum dots and, in particular, their heterostructures that can be processed through simple solution means are generating new opportunities through simplified fabrication processes, improved device performance and new functional capabilities. Central to incorporating these materials into electronic/optoelectronic devices is the understanding of how their surfaces and interfaces affect placement of charge carriers in and out of these materials. In turn, exploiting different surfaces/interfaces to control these fundamental processes and therefore improve device characteristics is essential in paving the path to the next generation of devices incorporating emerging nanoscale materials. This project examines critical surface and interfacial factors that impact photovoltaic and electroluminescence characteristics of devices consisting of colloidal quantum dots and in particular, their anisotropic heterostructures. Varying composition and shape provides a deeper understanding of the interplay between surface/interface effects, the underlying band structure, and shape/anisotropy. The knowledge gained should be broadly applicable to designing new materials with appropriate surfaces and interfaces for radically improved device performance and capabilities. The research endeavors of this project are synergistic with education and outreach efforts. Research findings inspire teaching and mentoring activities, impacting education while also promoting interest in fundamental science among the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One measures the response of the body to X-rays and makes an image of what is inside from this information. The principal investigator will investigate ultrasound transmission and reflection tomography which uses high frequency sound waves instead of X-rays.  Also several inverse problems in cosmology will be considered. The main questions is whether one can determine the structure of the Universe billions of years ago from measurements made near the Earth.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will address the mathematical theory of several fundamental inverse problems arising in many areas of science and technology including medical imaging, geophysics, cosmology, and nondestructive testing. Three major topics of research will be investigated. The first one is Travel Time Tomography in anisotropic media. In mathematical terms this involves the determination of a Riemannian metric  or Finsler metric (anisotropic sound speed) in the interior of a domain from the lengths of geodesics joining points of the boundary (travel times) and from other kinematic information. The second is inverse problems for non-linear equations arising in many applications including general relativity, elasticity, fluids etc. The main idea is to use the nonlinear interaction of waves to produce new waves that will help solve the inverse problems. The third is Electric Impedance Tomography (EIT), also called Calderon's problem. In this inverse method one attempts to determine the conductivity of a medium by making voltage and current measurements at the boundary.

When we listen to music, when we use our cell phones, when we warm up a dinner in a microwave, when we look at the stars in the sky and when we relax on a sunny beach. But wave phenomena may also affect the lives of millions of people when earthquakes shake and propagate, tsunamis form or nuclear radiations get out of control.  Indeed, waves naturally arise occur in a variety of physical systems such as nonlinear optics, atmosphere and ocean waves, quantum mechanics and plasmas. The study of waves  is fundamental for the understanding of phenomena at both a very small scale, such as the Bose-Einstein Condensate, and at a very large one, such as collusion of galaxies. These expressions of nature are never too smooth and rarely too simple: interactions of small waves can produce very large outcomes, such as freak waves, while complicated objects such as  solitons almost do not see each other when they cross. Phenomena such as these are the byproduct of nonlinear wave interactions, and understanding what  are the possible outcomes, given the initial state of a system of waves, is fundamental to predict and  to control it, hopefully to our advantage. <br/><br/>In this NSF supported research the PIs present a series of projects at the cutting edge of research in nonlinear wave phenomena in which deterministic approaches, classically based on harmonic and Fourier analysis, are implemented alongside probabilistic ones to capture basic properties of wave phenomena. It has become clear in recent years that deterministic methods and probabilistic ones naturally feed off each other and when combined not only contribute to our understanding but also open the door to new paradigms to move research forward in various directions. More precisely, the PIs propose four  projects  at the forefront of nonlinear evolution equations, where the interplay of deterministic and probabilistic  approaches is the key to make progress. The problems range from the study of weak turbulence for dispersive and fluid equations to the analysis  of integrable structures, from  the definition of Gibbs type measures to the probabilistic existence and stability of certain geometric flows enjoying null form nonlinearities. The probabilistic component of PIs' work in the last few years has contributed in bridging the dispersive and wave  nonlinear equations community with that specialized in stochastic partial differential equations. This interaction has created ongoing collaborations between members of these two communities. The work that the PIs, their students and collaborators will generate in solving the problems described in this project will further solidify the interactions between these two vibrant communities. The broader impact component of the project aims at fostering the training of doctoral graduate students and junior researchers in the US, thus fundamentally contributing to the STEM workforce.

We take a community-based approach to reduce cost, with active glacier scientists collecting samples gratis during their own field campaigns to contribute to this project.

Our latitudinal transect is designed to maximize understanding of how glaciers responded to orbital variations, as well as how climate may have been coupled between the low and high latitudes and across the hemispheres.

Professor Xu is developing new, more sustainable methods for converting readily available hydrocarbons into more valuable molecules that contain one or more nitrogen atoms. A large number of small-molecule pharmaceuticals and functional materials contain nitrogen atoms, a situation that makes the chemistry being developed both timely and important for addressing modern synthetic needs. The chemistry is also more sustainable that the current state-of-the-art methods because the reagents used by Professor Xu and his students are derived from iron - the second most abundant metal in the Earth's crust - and stable, common peroxides. These simple reagents replace the much more rare and expensive reagents typically used for the current methods. The research program lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, and mechanistic chemistry; therefore, it provides a unique education opportunity for all levels of young scientists. This opportunity is especially important because of the large number of minority students who attend Georgia State University and Professor Xu's strong commitment to working with those students.<br/> <br/>This research program aims to develop and study novel synthetic approaches that harness stable peroxides to selectively functionalize a broad range of olefins with non-oxygen-based groups. In the first phase of this project, Professor Xu and his students are exploring the reactivity of unique iron complexes with stable peroxides and developing an iron-catalyzed method for selective olefin diazidation/diamination reactions. The work is expanding the development of iron-catalyzed process for a broad range of olefins and N-heterocycles. In the second phase of this project, the group is exploring new iron-catalyzed activation approaches for fluoroalkyl transfer reactions. The work is providing a general and selective approach for olefin functionalization that will likely become a useful tool for organic chemists.

Scale-up of this technology will transform the large-scale purification of biopharmaceuticals and lower prescription drug costs - the most important factor contributing to rising healthcare costs.  The major factor influencing the rising cost of healthcare is the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals - up to 40% of the medical plan cost will be drugs by 2025.  Prescription drug costs are the fastest rising component of healthcare and are contributing to the dramatic increase in healthcare costs.  The worldwide focus of pharmacy and biotechnology is now on biopharmaceutical development and production to address this issue.  Direct benefits of this project include low-cost, use of green reagents, and the absence of heavy metal impurities in the purified protein.  In addition, the development of immobilized enzymes using this technology will open new frontiers in biocatalysis, biosensors, diagnostics and protein delivery.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop protein purification kits for small-scale and research-scale research. Bringing these kits to market will enable researchers to further validate the technology on a broader range of proteins in preparation for scale-up for biopharmaceutical production.  Synthetic biology has quickly begun to revolutionize drug discovery and design by providing a better overall molecular understanding of disease.  However, this potential has yet to be fully realized due to the challenges associated with purifying the target recombinant protein from the thousands of naturally-occurring proteins produced by the expression system.  The three specific aims of the project are: 1) validation of protein tag performance for multiple protein classes and expression systems, 2) development of low-cost methods for protein tag removal from purified proteins, and 3) development of solutions for the purification of low-expressing proteins and the parallel purification of small amounts of proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to understand certain properties of the physical world such as angles, distances and properties of certain shapes. Differential geometry was developed to use the tools of calculus to understand the geometry of curved spaces--for example, the curvature of space by matter as predicted by general relativity, or the properties of soap bubbles (which turn out to be related to the equations describing black holes). In the same way that Descartes realized that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential equations.  The research in this project involves disparate problems from geometry and mathematical physics but are united by the role played by mathematical analysis in their study.   In addition to mathematical investigations, the PI will be organizing a summer residential STEM program in cooperation with the Chicago Pre-College Science and Engineering Program, and supported by the Notre Dame TRiO Program.  This will be a two-week program run in the summers of 2019 and 2020 for high school students from Chicago Public Schools, many of whom will be first-generation college students.  The program will run for two weeks, and will include mathematics instruction and project-based learning <br/> <br/>There are two main mathematical themes supported by this award. Poincare-Einstein manifolds are generalizations of the Poincare ball model of hyperbolic space.  They are complete manifolds satisfying the Einstein condition (with negative Einstein constant) which can be compactified by conformally changing the metric that vanishes at an appropriate rate at infinity.  They arise in several areas of mathematics and theoretical physics; for example, in in the Fefferman-Graham theory of conformal invariants and in the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum field theory. One area of investigation supported by this award is the fundamental question of existence:  given a manifold with boundary and a conformal class of metrics on the boundary, can one construct a Poincare-Einstein metric whose compactification induces the given conformal class on the boundary?  In joint work with Q. Han and S. Stolz, the PI is developing new tools to detect obstructions to existence based on the topology and geometry of the boundary. On the other hand, in work with G. Szekelyhidi the PI was able to prove local existence of solutions (i.e., in a neighborhood of infinity). Another area of research with connections to physics is the PI's ongoing work with J. Streets and C. Kelleher on the variational properties of the Yang-Mills functional in four dimensions.  Building on the recent work, which gave a new sharp lower bound for minimizing solutions, the PI will investigate the behavior of solutions with large Morse index.  The PI will prove a lower bound for the energy depending (in a precise way) on the index of the solution and the geometry of the base manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, there are few methodologies that enable study of these linkages, particularly the molecular signaling processes between the molecules, cells, and tissues involved, let alone their connection to behavior. Human and animal studies are expensive and time consuming, and they typically do not provide information at the molecular level. Importantly, it is at this level that information is needed. Culturing human cells and tissues on miniature microfluidic devices to mimic actual systems in the human body has been considered as one of the most promising alternatives to human or animal studies. While potentially transformative, these devices can be complex, as they sometimes include nutrient supplies, cells, actuators, pumps, valves, and even detector systems. To simplify, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a modular approach comprised of optimally designed subsystems. Their approach will also provide new efficient avenues for manipulating these cells and understanding their responses to molecular signals. Microelectrodes will be integrated and directly connected to cells and tissues for stimulating and interrogating cellular responses. Because the biological systems are ""wired"" to electrodes, this enables ""programmed"" function and highly accurate assessment of responses.<br/><br/>Previously the PI's group has developed methods to electronically actuate and record signaling processes among bacteria and epithelial cells of human GI tract. While information processing in biology is accomplished by the secretion and perception of molecules, information processing within electronic devices is accomplished using electrons. The methodologies they have developed interconvert information content as it flows from molecules to electrons and back. To do this, they use synthetic biology and thin film microfabrication methodologies to assemble ""smart"" interfaces between biological systems and microelectronic devices. They base their methods on redox-based signals that uniquely span communication modalities. There are three specific aims in the proposed work. In Aim 1, the PIs will develop actuator devices that transduce electrical inputs to molecular signaling molecules, specifically bacterial quorum sensing autoinducers that regulate behavior.  In Aim 2, they will develop sensor devices that communicate in the opposite direction - biomolecular information will be converted to electrical outputs. The researchers will determine molecular concentrations electronically, both directly and with the aid of enzymes and engineered cells that are incorporated into the devices. In Aim 3, these sensor/actuator modules will be integrated into a complete ""animal-on-a-chip"" system. Using this modular approach, the complexity of the current systems will be reduced, the throughput of these devices will be increased, and the efficiency of the entire process will be dramatically enhanced.<br/> <br/>The PIs expect these studies will vastly improve our ability to understand the ?communication? between molecules, cells, and tissues in the human body. Most importantly, the proposed work creates a new vantage point for interrogating biology at the length and time scales associated with its function. Equally importantly, because these systems incorporate techniques and methods from several disciplines, and because the perceived benefits to society are so great, they attract energetic and talented students who will become the innovators and leaders of the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The answer to that question will shed light on why the world is home to so many different species and how we might prevent their extinction. This project explores the question in a relatively new way: through the lens of evolution. The research makes use of an insect model study system - damselflies, which are colorful insect predators similar to dragonflies. Rather than assuming that a species of damselfly is the same no matter what lake it is from, the researcher will attempt to show that damselflies from different lakes are different in how they are built and what they need, and that those differences have big effects on other species of damselflies from the same lakes. The project will also provide meaningful research and teaching opportunities to both undergraduate and graduate students.  The researcher will conduct a formal assessment of his mentoring activities to help understand how gaps between scientists and educators are unintentionally created and what we can do to bridge those gaps.  <br/><br/>Spatially replicated experiments will assess variation among damselfly communities in fitness differences between competing species, which could cause competitive exclusion, and the stabilizing niche differences that prevent exclusion and favor coexistence. Reciprocal transplant experiments will determine whether and how local adaptation affects fitness differences and/or stabilizing effects. Additional experiments using a unique biogeographic pattern will establish whether coexistence evolves as a consequence of competitors co-evolving to reduce competition, or whether competitors have adapted independently to ecological niches where they co-occur. Results from the experimental studies will be combined with measures of environmental factors to determine which features of the environment shape fitness differences and stabilization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the investigator and his collaborators focus on integral geometric problems where the complexity lies in the type of object to be reconstructed, in the fact that the geometry of propagation of information is curved, and in the nonlinear character of some of these problems.

In addition we will study of the behavior of evolutionary games, which were introduced many years ago to help understand animal behavior and have recently been used to understand the interactions of different cell types in cancer modeling. Despite the fact that it has been clearly established that spatial structure changes the outcome of evolutionary games, most applications assume homogeneous mixing and use the replicator equation to determine the dynamics. Having a well developed theory that predicts the behavior of spatial games will be useful for applications. Much of this theory has been developed under the assumption of weak selection, so it is important to understand whether the results are valid when selection is not weak.<br/><br/>Work will be carried out on evolutionary games, variants of the voter model, coalescing random walk, and epidemics.

Because new streams and rivers are rare, little is known about how they form. One place we can learn about this process is within volcanic landscapes. After catastrophic volcanic eruptions, water from springs and snowmelt carve fresh stream channels. The trees that line the newly formed rivers and streams then provide shade, shelter, and crucial inputs of leaves and nutrients into these aquatic systems. These trees also help shape the rivers themselves by stabilizing banks, creating meanders, and slowing erosion. This project examines willows that have colonized along streams that formed after the eruption of Mount St. Helens. Researchers will study the influence of genetic variation in these trees on the development, ecosystem structure, and successional processes of the associated stream communities. Understanding the impact that the genetics of trees plays in the development of river systems has the potential to transform our understanding of how aquatic ecosystems are structured. This research is also important for the management and conservation of rivers because it explores the critical roles trees play in the formation of river systems following disturbances.

In this context, however, the relationships among magmatism, lithospheric thinning and crustal extension are poorly constrained. The PIs will evaluate the role of lithospheric drip magmatism as a trigger for successful continental rifting by studying alkaline mafic lavas from the Bufumbira and Toro Ankole volcanic fields in western Uganda. A growing body of evidence suggests that density instabilities in the lowermost lithosphere can undergo abrupt localized destabilization in response to regional thermal or mechanical stress. This physical thinning of the lithosphere, occurring on a scale of 20-50 km, enhances both magmatism and the likelihood of extensional failure, i.e., successful continental rifting, and thus controls the ultimate shape of continental margins. The work couples detailed geochemical analysis of proposed drip-related lavas and their accompanying mantle xenoliths with geophysical modeling of lithospheric drip and the ensuing crustal extension. The implications of this work to the understanding of continental extension represent a new approach to predicting the locus of new ocean basins and the forces required to produce them. At a regional scale, this work is of high importance to nations along the East African Rift: drip magmatism does not sustain the shallow long-lived magma chambers that are necessary for viable geothermal energy production. In terms of human resources, this project supports female researchers from a wide range of educational institutions as well as graduate and undergraduate students in geochemistry and geodynamics, and brings a short-course in geophysics to geology undergraduates who seek careers in this field. <br/><br/>The lithospheric mantle is foundational - literally and conceptually - to the construction, destruction and division of tectonic plates. Modification of the lithospheric mantle by magma and fluids affects its composition and, by extension, buoyancy. If the bottom of the lithosphere is made denser, the base of the lithosphere can detach and sink, leading to small-volume basaltic volcanism, lithospheric thinning, and potentially rifting. Geochemical data on lavas suggest lithospheric drips drive volcanism in several parts of the East African Rift. Also, xenoliths from this area show significant metasomatism by melts and fluids, and lithospheric removal has been invoked to explain the timing and rates of recent uplift. In order to test this hypothesis, the role of lithospheric drips will be evaluated by: 1) obtaining detailed petrographic and mineral-scale compositional data on lavas and pyroxenite xenoliths, 2) calculating the physical conditions recorded by lavas and xenoliths, and 3) applying those calculations to 2D and 3D geodynamic models to whether lithospheric drip tectonics and melting explain the rocks themselves. Lithospheric drip melting is somewhat paradoxical, because cold descending lithosphere should not melt unless it is heated through conduction more rapidly than it becomes compressed during descent. It may be that additional complexity to symmetrical dripping is required, such as edge-driven convection during rifting or a nearby upwelling plume. This project will promote collaboration between 3 U.S. universities, including an REU institution, and provide opportunity for researchers from Uganda.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Largely absent from this research, however, is an understanding of reservation materiality, that is, how federal policies and Native activities were made manifest in reservation homes, tools, foods, and other objects associated with daily life. Archaeology is well-suited to fill this gap. Unlike written and ethnographic sources, which on reservations were composed primarily by non-Native outsiders with clear political agendas, the archaeological record preserves evidence of Native practices in multiple settings, including those that existed out of sight of federal officials. This project combines archaeological and archival research to document the experiences of Native communities living on the Grand Ronde Reservation in northwestern Oregon. Conducted as part of two community-based research initiatives, this project will provide archaeological field and laboratory training to undergraduate and graduate students. It will also extend opportunities to Grand Ronde tribal members to participate in all aspects of the research, accomplishing the dual goals of increasing the participation of Native people in archaeology and enhancing the capacity of the community to identify and protect tribal heritage. Results will be made available through university data repositories and public presentations at local museums, academic conferences, and Grand Ronde events. Situated at the intersections of archaeology, history, and Native American studies, this work will lend new insight into American colonialism, Native American history, and the value of community-based research in the social sciences. <br/> <br/> In collaboration with the Grand Ronde Historic Preservation Office, the project's Principal Investigators will examine the interplay between federal policies aimed at terminating Native lifeways and Grand Ronde survivance, a process of preserving, adapting, and creating cultural traditions. The project focuses on a reservation habitation area used by tribal members from the 1850s through at least the 1920s. Cartographic evidence suggests that this site was part of a larger settlement strategy through which the Grand Ronde community reiterated historic relationships between different Native groups. Archaeological survey and excavation will be used to assess whether similar attempts to maintain pre-reservation practices influenced interior house organization, especially the construction of hearth boxes and sub-floor storage areas, and diet composition. Comparing recovered artifacts to pre-reservation archaeological sites and archival material will reveal the strategies employed by the Grand Ronde community to remake a foreign and often hostile landscape into a culturally familiar home.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team is using state-wide media to increase awareness of how fundamental catalysis research impacts economically important industries, both present and future.<br/><br/>	With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, a collaborative team from Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma is using an interdisciplinary synthesis, characterization, simulation, and reaction analysis approach to determine to whether or not water actively influences reactions in solid acid catalysts.   Drs. White, Resasco, and Crossley, are engaged in tailored synthesis of zeolites, post-synthetic modifications of zeolites, in-situ spectroscopic NMR measurements, and reactor studies at varying temperature and pressure to determine how catalyst structure responds to the presence of both gas-phase and liquid-phase water.  Dr. Wang is providing DFT (density functional theory) and MD (molecular dynamics) calculations to help the team elucidate probable reaction pathways.  Conversion of both non-polar hydrocarbons derived for traditional petroleum sources as well as oxygenated molecules derived from biomass are under investigation. Also under investigation is the role of small populations of highly-active ?defect? catalytic sites in the absence and presence of water  The team is advancing inclusion of under-represented groups in STEM disciplines through programs on each campus, and increasing public awareness of the benefit of catalysis through public media outlets at the university and state level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sediments from Lake Chalco, just outside Mexico City, hold geologic, paleoenvironmental, and paleobiological information of value to the global scientific community, and directly relevant to the >20 million people living in the Basin of Mexico. Much of Mexico is projected to become drier in the coming decades and centuries in response to ongoing climate change; these anthropogenic changes will be superimposed on natural variability in climate systems. In central Mexico projections generally point to drying as a result of decreased rainfall during the summer rainy season and enhanced evaporation rates. Analysis of records of temperature and precipitation will provide a means to evaluate the history of climate preserved in Lake Chalco sediments. Results of this project will contribute to an improved understanding of climate and hydrological balance in one of the most densely populated urban centers on Earth. Hydrological balance is critical, impacting agriculture and drinking water as well as affecting vulnerability to disease. This study will enable more detailed assessment of volcanic history in the Mexico City region, which will also allow development of volcanic hazard assessment for the region that is based on a comprehensive understanding of past activity. The Basin of Mexico is one of the world's most heavily populated areas, and fallout deposits from large explosive eruptions have the potential to significantly disrupt the entire city. The team will incorporate field guides from Mexico into the ""Flyover Country"" mobile app, which will be available in English and Spanish. The project supports the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce by including early-to-mid career women in significant roles and through the inclusion of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. <br/><br/>To evaluate the role of low latitudes in initiating and propagating global changes, we need information regarding the geographical distribution and timing of abrupt changes in the tropics. A long and detailed climate record from central Mexico, the geographic center of North American tropical palaeoclimate sites, will enhance our understanding of the mid-latitude to tropical linkages in North American climate. The primary scientific objective of this joint NSF-GEO/NERC proposal is to obtain a continuous, high-resolution record of past changes in climate and biota in the North American tropics since the mid-Pleistocene. We will analyze a recently recovered ~350m lacustrine sedimentary sequence from the Lake Chalco basin on the southern outskirts of Mexico City. The Chalco sediment sequence is likely to provide a >350,000 year record of climate and environmental change, as well as a remarkable reconstruction of regional volcanic activity. Topics of particular interest include 1) glacial/interglacial variability in the influence of major climate modes such as migration of the InterTropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and Westerlies, 2) orbital scale variability, particularly the influence of precession on the location of the ITCZ and its influence on the Mesoamerican Monsoon, and 3) millennial scale variability during glacial periods and terminations. Interplay between air masses controlled by temperature changes in the Pacific and Atlantic basins is stronger in Chalco than at other sites, and hydroclimate changes are amplified due to its high altitude location. This will be among the longest archives of climate, environment, and biota from North America, from a region presently lacking such records.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research program will develop novel stimuli-responsive polymers whose function and properties can be controlled by light exposure.  This is exciting as light is a ""clean"" stimulus in that it can be applied remotely without physical contact, is readily patternable, and its intensity can be tuned with great fidelity. Unfortunately, there are few compounds that are light-responsive.   The planned research program will provide pathways to direct these structural changes to improve their performance in functional devices and to amplify these structural changes. The results of this research program will therefore expand the applications that can be rationally controlled and patterned by light exposure, which will significantly extend the practicality of light-responsive materials.<br/> <br/>Workforce development and training of the next generation of scientists and engineers who are prepared to tackle the grand challenges in stimuli-responsive materials will be realized through this research program and also by engaging public high school students in  hands-on research experiences, thus providing exceptional preparation for college. Further impact will result from the completion of experiments at the national neutron facilities at ORNL and NIST where the students participating in this project will acquire hands-on experience in a multi-user facility and contribute to the continued health of these national resources. This project will also further develop the sustainable research infrastructure in Tennessee and will be implemented to promote the participation of underrepresented groups in research.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research program is to provide pathways to rationally control the optoelectronic performance of conjugated polymers by altering their molecular, nanoscale, and mesoscale structure with exposure to light, as well as to provide robust routes to amplify their light-induced structural changes so as to realize novel light-responsive materials. Current results clearly show that the absorption of a photon by conjugated polymers reversibly alters their structure, assembly, and functionality.  Therefore, this research program will elucidate the relationship between light-induced structural order in conjugated polymeric active layers and their photo-physical properties. In parallel, targeted conjugated polymer constructs that are designed to augment their alteration in structure and assembly when exposed to light in solutions and thin films will be developed and harnessed to provide routes to new stimuli-responsive materials with desired properties.  This research program will develop methods to amplify the structural changes of conjugated polymers with exposure to light and correlate light-induced alteration of the hierarchical structure of conjugated-polymer mixtures to optimal functional response. This critical information will then be used to elucidate guidelines to enable the systematic modification, rational design and control of novel light-responsive materials with targeted properties.   This research will also attempt to directly correlate the impact of photon absorption on conjugated polymer configuration, assembly, and vertical morphology to the optoelectronic performance of conjugated polymer active layers. This in turn may further provide crucial links toward the rational design of conjugated polymer solutions or blends and associated thermal, light, and deposition processing protocols so as to realize devices with optimal functional performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has on one hand made algebra and geometry extremely valuable in particle physics; and on the other hand has allowed powerful physical intuition to be used in the development of pure mathematics. Continuing in this tradition, the research goals of this project fit into a broader effort to incorporate modern mathematical ideas and methodology in quantum field theory and vice versa. In educational components of the project, the PI will host a summer school on this theme for graduate students in theoretical physics and mathematics and he will develop a series of lectures for undergraduate and graduate students, freely available online, that delineate various connections between modern algebra/geometry and quantum field theory.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will combine physical and mathematical approaches to uncover new structures in supersymmetric gauge theory and geometric representation theory. The PI and his collaborators have established the beginnings of a deep relation between mirror symmetry in 3d supersymmetric gauge theories and symplectic duality. Symplectic duality is an equivalence of geometric categories associated to pairs of algebraic-symplectic varieties that was conjectured by Braden, Licata, Proudfoot, and Webster, and that generalizes many classic results in geometric representation theory (such as the Koszul duality of Beilinson, Ginzburg, and Soergel relating categories of modules for simple Lie algebras). In this project, the PI and his collaborators will use new techniques in gauge theory to establish a systematic construction of objects in the categories relevant for symplectic duality, and an explicit duality map between them. He will also define and investigate yet another category, of Fukaya-Seidel type, that gauge theory predicts to be equivalent to the usual categories in Symplectic Duality, but which seems to make many subtle aspects of the duality manifest. Finally, he will extend the methods developed to study 3d gauge theories to 4d supersymmetric gauge theories, where they lead to a construction of the categories of line operators -- with far-reaching implications for categorification of wall-crossing fomulas and of cluster algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Remarkably, the case of the free group is still open and continues to provide focus for work in this direction.

All chemical reactions in the living cell involve molecules bumping and sticking to one another, and molecular form or structure is a central determinant of complementarity and strength of molecular interactions. In particular, by assuming specific structures, proteins are able to regulate diverse processes that maintain and replicate the living cell. With structure determination in laboratories lagging desperately behind the rapidly-growing number of protein-encoding gene sequences by high-throughput sequencing technologies, computational approaches to the problem of protein structure prediction now have a central role in molecular biology. This project advances algorithmic research to address the current impasse in form-function related problems in molecular biology. In particular, the project develops advanced  optimization methods to explore the vast protein structure space and leverages information-integration techniques under the deep learning framework to effectively guide the exploration towards biologically-active structures.

The main focus is on the de-novo protein structure prediction problem, which is central to inferring biological activities of a rapidly-growing number of protein-encoding gene sequences. The proposed research generalizes the problem of exploring and obtaining a comprehensive view of a protein's structure space as that of computing a diverse ensemble of constraint-satisfying structures and then leveraging information-integration techniques to guide the exploration to regions of the structure space relevant for biological activity. The research proposes hybrid stochastic optimization algorithms for comprehensive exploration of protein structure spaces, deep convolutional neural networks for better assessment of structure nativeness, and combines the two in an information-integration algorithmic framework to guide the exploration of a structure space towards native structures. By doing so, the proposed research investigates a direction complementary to physics-based treatments, proposing to supplant such treatments with machine-learned models of nativeness. The research will benefit researchers in machine learning, stochastic optimization, and information integration with application-driven interests in molecular modeling, protein structure prediction, and modeling of complex, dynamic systems. The research will be disseminated via various venues, including an open-source software package, and will provide training opportunities for under-represented students of all levels at the interface of optimization, deep learning, and computational biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this context, however, the relationships among magmatism, lithospheric thinning and crustal extension are poorly constrained. The PIs will evaluate the role of lithospheric drip magmatism as a trigger for successful continental rifting by studying alkaline mafic lavas from the Bufumbira and Toro Ankole volcanic fields in western Uganda. A growing body of evidence suggests that density instabilities in the lowermost lithosphere can undergo abrupt localized destabilization in response to regional thermal or mechanical stress. This physical thinning of the lithosphere, occurring on a scale of 20-50 km, enhances both magmatism and the likelihood of extensional failure, i.e., successful continental rifting, and thus controls the ultimate shape of continental margins. The work couples detailed geochemical analysis of proposed drip-related lavas and their accompanying mantle xenoliths with geophysical modeling of lithospheric drip and the ensuing crustal extension. The implications of this work to the understanding of continental extension represent a new approach to predicting the locus of new ocean basins and the forces required to produce them. At a regional scale, this work is of high importance to nations along the East African Rift: drip magmatism does not sustain the shallow long-lived magma chambers that are necessary for viable geothermal energy production. In terms of human resources, this project supports female researchers from a wide range of educational institutions as well as graduate and undergraduate students in geochemistry and geodynamics, and brings a short-course in geophysics to geology undergraduates who seek careers in this field. <br/><br/>The lithospheric mantle is foundational - literally and conceptually - to the construction, destruction and division of tectonic plates. Modification of the lithospheric mantle by magma and fluids affects its composition and, by extension, buoyancy. If the bottom of the lithosphere is made denser, the base of the lithosphere can detach and sink, leading to small-volume basaltic volcanism, lithospheric thinning, and potentially rifting. Geochemical data on lavas suggest lithospheric drips drive volcanism in several parts of the East African Rift. Also, xenoliths from this area show significant metasomatism by melts and fluids, and lithospheric removal has been invoked to explain the timing and rates of recent uplift. In order to test this hypothesis, the role of lithospheric drips will be evaluated by: 1) obtaining detailed petrographic and mineral-scale compositional data on lavas and pyroxenite xenoliths, 2) calculating the physical conditions recorded by lavas and xenoliths, and 3) applying those calculations to 2D and 3D geodynamic models to whether lithospheric drip tectonics and melting explain the rocks themselves. Lithospheric drip melting is somewhat paradoxical, because cold descending lithosphere should not melt unless it is heated through conduction more rapidly than it becomes compressed during descent. It may be that additional complexity to symmetrical dripping is required, such as edge-driven convection during rifting or a nearby upwelling plume. This project will promote collaboration between 3 U.S. universities, including an REU institution, and provide opportunity for researchers from Uganda.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such defects may degrade semiconductor properties by trapping charge carriers to reduce the current and charge speed. These imperfections depend sensitively on the specific techniques used for growing and/or subsequent thermal, chemical, and plasma treatments. The research, which combines experimental studies with transport modeling, is aimed at measuring the optical properties of lattice structural and chemical imperfections of these relatively unexplored semiconductors, using growth variations, plasma, hydrogen annealing, and irradiation treatments to identify their physical nature and electrical measurements in magnetic fields to identify their ability to donate or accept electrons. The project ultimate goal is to understand the nature of these defects and eventually to eliminate them. The ability to remove these structural and/or chemical defects impacts a range of technologies. Zinc oxide is a prime candidate to replace today's high-cost materials in solar cells, digital displays, and light emitting diodes. Gallium oxide's ability to handle very high voltages can improve power switches for telecommunications and power transmission. Indium gallium oxide can provide higher speed displays and high-resolution TVs. Scandium nitride can lower resistance and power consumption of metallic contacts to semiconductors used in cellphones. The activities provide collaborative research opportunities for a graduate student, several university undergraduates, and high school students from an all-girl's high school.<br/><br/>Technical description: The research focuses on fundamental studies of native point defects in the semiconductors ZnO, Ga2O3, InGaZnO, and ScN, which have emerged as critical materials for advanced high power and optoelectronic display applications. ZnO, doped with Ga or Al, is the prime candidate to replace expensive indium tin oxide in solar cells, displays, light emitting diodes, and touchscreens. Ga2O3 is the dominant new material for power switches because of its record high breakdown voltage. InGaZnO is the dominant amorphous oxide replacing amorphous-Si transistors in displays and high-resolution TVs (e.g., Sharp). ScN can improve ohmic contacts in GaN-based devices and serve as a buffer layer for GaN-on-Si technology. All four can be highly doped with impurity donors, yet all four are impacted by deep level defects that compensate free carriers and introduce scattering that reduces carrier mobility. The nature of native point defects in Ga2O3, InGaZnO, and ScN as well as ZnO is almost completely unexplored, yet these defects can have a major impact on carrier density, mobility, and interface transport. The research team will measure the spatial distribution and physical nature of specific defects using 3-dimensional nanoscale optical spectroscopies coupled with donor /acceptor densities and dielectric properties by temperature-dependent Hall effect and reflectance/transmission measurements, respectively, in order to identify and quantify defect densities on a near-nm scale and understand how to control them through new growth and processing techniques. The goals of this work are to understand the primary compensating defects in these compounds that limit degenerate doping and produce lower mobilities, combining near-surface remote plasma, implantation and thermal processing with optical and surface science techniques to identify these native point defects, correlate them with donor/acceptor densities, and chemically control them. The project also aims to explore the impact of these defects on barriers and transport at Schottky barriers and heterojunctions involving these semiconductors. The overall goal of the project is to control these defects and their impact on carrier densities and junction transport by selected growth and processing techniques that improve conductivity and interface properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These compounds, i.e. (In,Ga)(S, Se, Te), have been shown to exhibit high-room-temperature carrier mobility, thickness-dependent band gaps and high photoresponsivities. Although monochalcogenides are nonmagnetic, a recent first principles calculation predicts spin-split valence bands in their monolayers, with both the magnetic moment and the spin polarization energy depending strongly on density. Thus, a normal metal-ferromagnet-normal metal transition is expected as the hole density is tuned, with ferromagnetism and half-metallicity emerging when atomically thin monochalcogenides are hole-doped to ~10^13/cm^2. This research project strives to achieve this ambitious goal by overcoming a number of critical challenges, including synthesis of high quality material, device fabrication and optimization, and efficient gating techniques. Successful implementation of the research plan is expected to lead to new half-metallic systems that can be combined with other layered compounds in heterostructures to produce novel functionalities.

The principal investigators are focused on the concept of the symmetry group of a path and are develop a code (to be made publicly available when ready) to implement these ideas in Quantum Espresso, an open-source density functional theory (DFT) software. Three model system classes are picked, namely, in simple perovskites, in layered oxides, and in multiferroics, to make predictions. The predicted MEPs with this approach are tested using the experimental techniques that push in-situ dynamics with 2-5 picometers metrology in electron microscopy, and ultrafast electron diffraction microscopy techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this project is to address the systems-level challenge by developing proof-of-concept TE concrete material that innately possesses TE properties and might result in an independent, comprehensive, and renewably sourced heating and cooling system.<br/><br/>The international team for this project will leverage advances in thermoelectric materials, conductive concrete, and building model predictive control to create a three-in-one thermoelectric concrete, called ThermoConc, as a building envelope for electricity generation and space heating and cooling. The goal is to develop fundamental understanding of the characteristics, behaviors, operations, and controls of a thermoelectric generation and heat pumping system as an energy efficient means to both passively and actively control building interior temperature and harvest waste heat while enhancing human thermal comfort. Objectives will be to: 1) identify optimal<br/>design and control of ThermoConc and establish mathematical models for performance evaluation; 2) characterize the new TE concrete and evaluate the performance of ThermoConc both theoretically and practically; and 3) assess environmental and economic benefits and quantify energy-saving potentials of ThermoConc through full-scale testing and climate-sensitivity case study.

Sediments from Lake Chalco, just outside Mexico City, hold geologic, paleoenvironmental, and paleobiological information of value to the global scientific community, and directly relevant to the >20 million people living in the Basin of Mexico. Much of Mexico is projected to become drier in the coming decades and centuries in response to ongoing climate change; these anthropogenic changes will be superimposed on natural variability in climate systems. In central Mexico projections generally point to drying as a result of decreased rainfall during the summer rainy season and enhanced evaporation rates. Analysis of records of temperature and precipitation will provide a means to evaluate the history of climate preserved in Lake Chalco sediments. Results of this project will contribute to an improved understanding of climate and hydrological balance in one of the most densely populated urban centers on Earth. Hydrological balance is critical, impacting agriculture and drinking water as well as affecting vulnerability to disease. This study will enable more detailed assessment of volcanic history in the Mexico City region, which will also allow development of volcanic hazard assessment for the region that is based on a comprehensive understanding of past activity. The Basin of Mexico is one of the world's most heavily populated areas, and fallout deposits from large explosive eruptions have the potential to significantly disrupt the entire city. The team will incorporate field guides from Mexico into the ""Flyover Country"" mobile app, which will be available in English and Spanish. The project supports the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce by including early-to-mid career women in significant roles and through the inclusion of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. <br/><br/>To evaluate the role of low latitudes in initiating and propagating global changes, we need information regarding the geographical distribution and timing of abrupt changes in the tropics. A long and detailed climate record from central Mexico, the geographic center of North American tropical palaeoclimate sites, will enhance our understanding of the mid-latitude to tropical linkages in North American climate. The primary scientific objective of this joint NSF-GEO/NERC proposal is to obtain a continuous, high-resolution record of past changes in climate and biota in the North American tropics since the mid-Pleistocene. We will analyze a recently recovered ~350m lacustrine sedimentary sequence from the Lake Chalco basin on the southern outskirts of Mexico City. The Chalco sediment sequence is likely to provide a >350,000 year record of climate and environmental change, as well as a remarkable reconstruction of regional volcanic activity. Topics of particular interest include 1) glacial/interglacial variability in the influence of major climate modes such as migration of the InterTropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and Westerlies, 2) orbital scale variability, particularly the influence of precession on the location of the ITCZ and its influence on the Mesoamerican Monsoon, and 3) millennial scale variability during glacial periods and terminations. Interplay between air masses controlled by temperature changes in the Pacific and Atlantic basins is stronger in Chalco than at other sites, and hydroclimate changes are amplified due to its high altitude location. This will be among the longest archives of climate, environment, and biota from North America, from a region presently lacking such records.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Failure or tearing of these tissues causes pain and disability. Tissue composition and molecular architecture are important to the tissue mechanical properties both during physiological loading and during failure. To date, there has been insufficient research focused on molecular level failure mechanics of fiber-reinforced tissues such as the intervertebral discs of the spine. Determining tissue failure properties and the roles that the various molecules of the tissue play in failure behavior is important for preventing disc disease and to designing new medical approaches for repairing the disc. The goal of this project is to determine how the fiber-reinforced tissue structure controls damage mechanics. For this work the PI will focus on the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc because of its cross-ply fiber architecture and medical relevance.  The educational outreach effort in this project is an expansion of the Girls in Engineering (GiE) Summer Program coordinated by the College of Engineering at Berkeley. The PI also will train graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in her laboratory during performance of the research project. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI will evaluate the role of the extrafibrillar matrix composition and fiber composition and network on time-dependent and -independent failure behavior. She will combine computational and experimental techniques to study failure mechanisms of fiber-reinforced materials, such as stress distributions between fibers and the extrafibrillar matrix. Her research team will leverage its previous work that developed an experimental method for robust failure testing of the annulus fibrosus. Data from tissue-level experiments will be incorporated into the existing finite element model of the disc joint to elucidate the role of fiber-matrix interactions during joint-level failure. In broader terms, the unique computational model developed from this research, where the extrafibrillar matrix and collagen fibers are described as separate and distinct materials will be beneficial for material scientists outside of biomechanics research (e.g., carbon fiber reinforced polymers) and for scientists investigating the contribution of fibers and extrafibrillar matrix on tissue mechanics (sub-failure and failure mechanics) with injury, aging, or repair.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even today, the details of how atoms interact are known only for a few combinations of metals, because the tools for studying materials at the atomic level have only recently become available. Those details have become increasingly important as modern technological advances demand smaller, lighter, and more compact designs with increased capabilities. This project will explore why adding certain metals make copper more flexible while others make it more brittle, (or more/less strong, or more/less conductive). The origin of this behavior can be traced to the interaction of the atoms and their electrons at internal defects called grain boundaries, where the atoms are packed together imperfectly. These boundaries are found throughout all metals, and greatly impact the behavior of metal parts, from wires in computer chips to seat brackets in airplanes. Understanding these interactions will allow engineers to design alloys from the atom level upward for the first time, enabling them to tailor properties of the alloys to reduce the power used in manufacturing, to prolong the service life of metal parts, or to create complex designs without compromising performance. The results of this work will be shared with the scientific and industrial communities at national and international technical conferences by students who, when they graduate, will become highly educated and practically trained members of the workforce. Participating in this project will also expose students to outreach and mentoring opportunities through several existing programs at SUNY Poly, including the continuing education of secondary school teachers, summer science camps for high school students, and a general science seminar series at a local branch of the public library. The professor and her team are committed to these efforts to de-mystify technology and make science (and scientists) accessible to all. <br/><br/><br/>Technical summary: <br/>Grain boundaries strongly impact a range of properties and behavior of polycrystalline metals; in nanostructured materials this effect can be even more dramatic because the number of atoms participating in those boundaries constitutes an appreciable fraction of the total atoms in the sample. As a result, observable properties are often dominated by interface, not bulk, material properties. Solute segregating to some or all of these interfaces can change the energy, mobility, structure and cohesion of boundaries through electronic interactions with the surrounding matrix. The nature of these interactions will be examined using a combination of analytical transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and density functional theory. These results will be used to elucidate the correlations between the atomic and electronic structures at grain boundaries and observed electro-mechanical properties of select copper alloys, to enable future materials-by-design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The light from pulsars is usually detected as radio waves or X rays.  The radio waves are emitted from charged plasma flowing along the pulsar's magnetic field lines, while the X rays are emitted from very hot (hence ""thermal"") surface areas, heated by backflowing plasma.   While the broad picture of pulsar radio and X-ray emission is known, many of the details are yet to be fully understood.  A research team at the University of Vermont will carry out a three part observational and theoretical program aimed at providing insight into pulsar emission mechanisms and studying the Milky Way's interstellar magnetic field.   The radio observations have been or will be conducted primarily with the Very Large Array, Arecibo, LOFAR and Green Bank.   X-ray observations have been made using the XMM-Newton satellite.   The first part of the program involves confirmation and extension of pulsar radio emission physics.  The second part will connect thermal X-ray to radio emission.   The third part will use pulsar measurements to help to understand the magnetic field in the plane of our Galaxy.  Undergraduate research students will be extensively involved in the projects and will receive invaluable scientific training that is simply not available in the classroom.<br/><br/>Through observational interpretation and computer modeling of the pulsar magnetosphere, astronomers now understand how charge currents are generated and where they flow, outlining the broad mechanisms of pulsar radio emission: where it is generated and how part of it escapes.  The planned study will advance capabilities to relate the emission physics to global magnetospheric processes, and provide the needed specificity for theorists to develop physical models for charged soliton radiation.   The research team will also use simultaneous X-ray and radio observations of pulsars with multiple emission states in order to learn how the backflow heating associated with thermal X-ray emission is connected to changes in the radio emission properties, and will identify candidate pulsars for future joint X-ray/radio investigations.  The nature, structure, and origin of the Galactic magnetic field is only partially understood. The project will include analyses of extensive, existing pulsar Faraday rotation measurements of distant and faint pulsars to contribute significantly to the understanding of the magnetic field in the plane of our Galaxy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hilbert's 20th problem was about existence of generalized solutions of partial differential equations and variational problems. This was a crucial question since the theory was at a dead end: the classical notion of a differentiable function was not sufficient for further development. This led to one of the greatest discoveries of mathematics of 20th century: the theory of Sobolev spaces. Without Sobolev spaces, further development (both theoretical and practical) of nonlinear partial differential equations would not be possible. Recent decades showed however, that the scope of applications of Sobolev spaces goes far beyond the theory of partial differential equations; the theory applies to differential geometry, geometric group theory, algebraic topology, sub-Riemannian geometry, and analysis on metric spaces, just to name a few. This is a very active area of contemporary mathematics with many unsolved problems and new emerging areas of research. This research project concerns analytic, geometric, and topological properties of Sobolev functions and mappings as well as other related classes of mappings that have low differentiability regularity. The focus of the principal investigator is on finding new bridges between seemingly unrelated aspects of the fields of analysis, geometry, and topology. Graduate students and young researchers will be trained through research involvement in the project.<br/><br/>In more detail, the principal investigator plans to explore the following topics. (1) Approximation of convex functions (which have second order distributional derivatives being Radon measures and thus low regularity from the differentiable viewpoint). (2) General theory of Sobolev extension domains. (3) Existence of translation-invariant operators (a question that does not deal with weakly differentiable functions). (4) Continuity of Orlicz-Sobolev mappings of finite distortion. (5) Regularity of Sobolev isometric immersions. (6) Sign of the Jacobian of a Sobolev homeomorphism. (7) Topologically nontrivial Kaufman-type counterexamples to the Sard theorem (while the Sard theorem deals with sufficiently smooth mappings, the principal investigator will investigate the case of mappings with low regularity). (8) Sobolev spaces on metric spaces. (9) Implicit function theorem for Lipschitz mappings into metric spaces. (10) Lipschitz homotopy groups of the Heisenberg groups.

Thus, research on the control of migration is critical from both basic and applied perspectives. Understanding how animals decide when to move is of particular importance given that this can dictate whether or not they arrive at their destination at an appropriate time for reproduction or overwintering. Many animals move in groups and social interactions and social cues are expected to be important in the decisions that animals make in preparation for and during migration. Yet, there is little known about the role of social cues in determining when animals begin or end migration or about the physiological mechanisms by which social signals might act to influence migratory timing. This collaborative project will address these two knowledge gaps using two species of migratory songbirds that have flexible migratory schedules and that are highly sensitive to social information. Results of this work will advance our understanding of how social cues influence both migratory timing and the hormonal regulation of migration. This project will also provide training and mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach activities linked to the project will engage elementary school students and the general public in migratory biology. Training and outreach activities at the university level and in elementary schools will target individuals from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The first goal of this collaborative project is to evaluate the influence of social cues (specifically, the migratory state of conspecifics) on the timing of migration. Experiments will be carried out to test the hypotheses that birds use cues from conspecifics to fine-tune timing of initiation and termination of migration. Social cues have not been well studied in the context of migratory timing and the project's inclusion of the termination phase of migration will be important in advancing the understanding of this particularly understudied phase of migration. The second goal of the project is to advance understanding of the endocrine and neuroendocrine regulation of migratory transitions, with the further objective of investigating how social cues influence endocrine and neuroendocrine parameters to potentially alter migratory timing. Thus, investigators will quantify changes in circulating steroid hormones and the availability of their receptors in the brain and peripheral tissues across transitions into and out of a migratory state. This type of whole-body approach to understanding endocrine mechanisms in the context of migration is unique. The investigators will also experimentally manipulate social cues to evaluate endocrine and neuroendocrine mechanisms by which these cues might influence migratory timing. The results of this project will thus greatly broaden understanding of the roles of social cues and plasticity of endocrine mechanisms in life history transitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, the time has come to go vertical, accommodating processor cores, accelerators, cache, and main memory in the same package. There are two ways of doing this: use through-silicon vias (TSVs) or monolithic 3D integration. TSVs do not have memory-on-logic stacking success stories.  Monolithic 3D integration uses monolithic inter-tier vias that have a much smaller diameter than TSVs, and enable many different design styles: transistor-level monolithic, gate-level monolithic, and block-level monolithic.  While fabrication and test techniques for monolithic 3D integration are maturing, monolithic 3D system architectures have not been investigated in depth.  The work on this project fills this gap. The methodologies and tools developed under this grant will be made available on the web. They will also be made available to the industry.  The material will be included in course materials, and under-represented graduate students will be attracted to this research through Princeton Fellowships.  Results will be disseminated through research articles and seminars.<br/><br/>There are various ""walls"" confronting computer system architects these days.  The Power Wall constrains the portion of the chip that can be powered on.  This is also known as the dark silicon problem.  The Memory Wall prevents efficient access to off-chip memory. Monolithic 3D integration has the potential to significantly alleviate the problems associated with these walls, especially for abundant-data problems, such as machine learning and inference, which are becoming commonplace. This project seeks to improve the energy efficiency of monolithic 3D system architectures by a factor of 500 relative to traditional system architectures.

Mariculture production is growing quickly, but the spatial patterns of production are varied, with some regions experiencing rapid expansion while others lack any development despite good conditions for growth.  The investigators will analyze the geographic, social, political, economic, and ecological dimensions of mariculture production, examining the importance of each factor in driving mariculture expansion.  Mariculture is expected to be an increasingly critical component of the global food system, with far more scope for expansion than land-based agriculture, yet to-date there is limited understanding of what drives the spatial and temporal patterns of production.  Additionally, the project addresses societal concerns regarding future food production, including food security, nutrition, environmental sustainability, and livelihoods.  Project results will be made available to decision-makers, regulators, and mariculture developers to inform policy interventions, development regulations, and economic incentives that guide sustainable mariculture growth in the future.  The project will also provide multidisciplinary research training to graduate and undergraduate students as well as a postdoctoral researcher. <br/><br/>By using a multidisciplinary approach, this research will provide novel insights into the expansion of food production systems and the industrialization of the oceans.

It is not well-understood why mariculture exhibits a geographically heterogeneous pattern of development or how farming technologies expand into new locations.  The investigators will conduct a global scale analysis of the spatial and temporal patterns of mariculture development and expansion.  The study will address questions about how innovations in mariculture diffuse across locations and whether there are certain enabling social, economic or governance conditions that are common pre-cursors to aquaculture development across regions.  Using large secondary data-sets, several different quantitative approaches such as spatial statistics, time series analysis, and multivariate regression analysis will be used to answer questions about worldwide mariculture expansion.  Project findings will be compared to previous work on drivers of agricultural expansion and intensification, seeking to understand how the distinct human-environment interactions in these two different contexts lead to convergent and/or divergent patterns.  In addition to its worldwide approach, the project will develop regional spatial analyses by focusing specifically on case material from New Zealand and Norway, which will examine mariculture drivers operating on sub-national scales.

To support students in these efforts, the project develops an easy-to-use software modeling tool that supports students in creating models while concurrently indicating the sources of evidence (data, simulations, etc.) that support their model-building choices. The products of this project, which include software, curriculum, and assessments, increase the capacity to engage young learners in ambitious science educational experiences that are consistent with the Next Generation Science Standards.

Building on past work, the project is developing a scaffolded framework for teaching students about complex systems concepts in the context of aquatic ecosystems. This software and associated curriculum aims to help students engage deeply with the specific biology content, the important cross-cutting systems concepts that it represents, and the crucial scientific practices that are involved in constructing scientific models based on multiple disparate forms of evidence. This project will therefore focus on two of the key cross-cutting concepts from the Next Generation Science Standards--systems thinking and scientific practices. The project investigates the efficacy of posited scaffolds and interventions through three complementary approaches: tutoring studies in more controlled settings with smaller sample sizes,  design experiments in five fifth-grade classrooms, and a quasi-experimental study. The classroom design experiments and experimental studies are carried out in diverse educational settings in Indiana and New Jersey. Outcomes measured include both student growth and discourse and interactions from video analysis.  Measures of student growth include interviews and written student artifacts.  Measures of discourse and interactions are coded as variables derived from video analysis. The findings support designers, researchers, and educators who not only make use of simulations in science curricula, but help situate them within robust scientific practices and habits of mind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sediments from Lake Chalco, just outside Mexico City, hold geologic, paleoenvironmental, and paleobiological information of value to the global scientific community, and directly relevant to the >20 million people living in the Basin of Mexico. Much of Mexico is projected to become drier in the coming decades and centuries in response to ongoing climate change; these anthropogenic changes will be superimposed on natural variability in climate systems. In central Mexico projections generally point to drying as a result of decreased rainfall during the summer rainy season and enhanced evaporation rates. Analysis of records of temperature and precipitation will provide a means to evaluate the history of climate preserved in Lake Chalco sediments. Results of this project will contribute to an improved understanding of climate and hydrological balance in one of the most densely populated urban centers on Earth. Hydrological balance is critical, impacting agriculture and drinking water as well as affecting vulnerability to disease. This study will enable more detailed assessment of volcanic history in the Mexico City region, which will also allow development of volcanic hazard assessment for the region that is based on a comprehensive understanding of past activity. The Basin of Mexico is one of the world's most heavily populated areas, and fallout deposits from large explosive eruptions have the potential to significantly disrupt the entire city. The team will incorporate field guides from Mexico into the ""Flyover Country"" mobile app, which will be available in English and Spanish. The project supports the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce by including early-to-mid career women in significant roles and through the inclusion of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. <br/><br/>To evaluate the role of low latitudes in initiating and propagating global changes, we need information regarding the geographical distribution and timing of abrupt changes in the tropics. A long and detailed climate record from central Mexico, the geographic center of North American tropical palaeoclimate sites, will enhance our understanding of the mid-latitude to tropical linkages in North American climate. The primary scientific objective of this joint NSF-GEO/NERC proposal is to obtain a continuous, high-resolution record of past changes in climate and biota in the North American tropics since the mid-Pleistocene. We will analyze a recently recovered ~350m lacustrine sedimentary sequence from the Lake Chalco basin on the southern outskirts of Mexico City. The Chalco sediment sequence is likely to provide a >350,000 year record of climate and environmental change, as well as a remarkable reconstruction of regional volcanic activity. Topics of particular interest include 1) glacial/interglacial variability in the influence of major climate modes such as migration of the InterTropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and Westerlies, 2) orbital scale variability, particularly the influence of precession on the location of the ITCZ and its influence on the Mesoamerican Monsoon, and 3) millennial scale variability during glacial periods and terminations. Interplay between air masses controlled by temperature changes in the Pacific and Atlantic basins is stronger in Chalco than at other sites, and hydroclimate changes are amplified due to its high altitude location. This will be among the longest archives of climate, environment, and biota from North America, from a region presently lacking such records.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These technologies are allowing a renewable resource to enter into areas of construction that were previously not feasible due to a variety of technical constraints. Despite the promise that mass timber holds, wood is ultimately a natural material with inherent variability and peculiarities. Before a new engineered wood product can be brought to market, extensive and expensive laboratory testing is required to establish its reliable properties. This project will enhance the opportunities for increased use of timber by understanding the fundamental mechanics necessary for accurate performance prediction, including response and behavior under extreme events.  The work will exploit advances in both computational modeling and materials characterization techniques, such that structural performance can be reliably predicted.  The outcomes of the work will benefit both the manufacturers of wood products, by allowing them to better optimize their fiber resource, and the architects and engineers who develop new structural systems.  For these parties, the new predictive capability will streamline both structural/architectural innovation and product development. Existing ties with both the wood products industry and the architectural community will ensure appropriate dissemination of results.<br/><br/>In order to realize the above outcomes, specific research activities will focus on a computational framework that will feature a novel mechanisms-based, isogeometric embedded-lattice model approximating the internal structure of mass timber. It will simulate the mechanical behavior at multiple scales including the effect of interfaces and defects. This computational model, which explicitly incorporates material morphology, will be calibrated through an experimental program that isolates and measures the micro- and meso-scale morphological features that dictate material behavior, and it will be validated through structural component-scale testing. Since the approach is designed to capture the physical mechanisms that dictate behavior, larger scale phenomena, such as size effects, will be predicted as a natural outcome of the simulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to control the production of GAGs with defined structure will enhanced their potential use in therapeutic applications.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained, and students from underrepresented groups will be actively recruited to perform research in the labs.

The innovative technology can transform the current practice of time-based visual inspection with inconsistent decisions to a sensor/data-based decision-supporting process for timely corrosion management. The intelligent system can not only inform end users identify and reduce safety risks to avoid unexpected failure and associated fatality but it can also achieve operational excellence by enhancing the service life of aging infrastructures where corrosion degradation is a main concern.  As corrosion has shown to cost about 3.1 percent of the national gross domestic product, this mitigation/management technology can have significant cost saving, and thus greatly benefit national economy.  The results and findings from this interdisciplinary research can be directly integrated into corrosion-related curriculums, attracting a broader participation of both undergraduate and graduate students from several disciplines. The pre-college, CORrosion Engineers (CORE), program with learning activities from video lectures on corrosion fundamentals to hands-on qualification tests of clothes as corrosion protection coating for minimum water penetration can stimulate the interests for STEM educations among K-12 young girls. In addition, two CORE programs are designed to involve middle and high school students from the underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The system consists of a corrosion protective duplex coating of an inner thermally-sprayed non-ferrous metal layer and an outer nanomaterial modified polymeric sealing paint layer, a corrosion assessment strategy with distributed fiber optic sensors embedded in the duplex coating, and a decision-making tool with dynamic risk assessment modeling. This research will advance the duplex coating technology by 1) optimizing composites of non-ferrous metal coating to achieve robust mechanical and corrosion resistance, and 2) understanding the chemical interaction between nano-additives and polymeric paints to accomplish the desirable dispersion. The interface bonding mechanics and behavior of duplex coating with both steel substrates and fiber optic sensors, more importantly, the effect of metal composites and nano-additives on improving the bond strength will be investigated using pull-off tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersion system (EDS) for interface structure and state analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique for phase composition analysis. With the distributed fiber optic sensors embedded in duplex coating layers, this research also aims to understand the in-situ corrosion deterioration mechanism of coated structural steel with combined cathodic and barrier protection. The in-situ corrosion data availed by the intelligent system enable the understanding on the path and rate of moisture and oxygen penetration through duplex coating to assess scenarios of the uniform corrosion through a large area of porous coatings or coating degradation, or pitted corrosion through local defects and damage. The corresponding assessment will be fed into a real-time corrosion condition updating algorithm to develop a self-updated hybrid corrosion risk management model for a cost-effective prioritization of mitigation actions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Functional nanoparticles have the potential to benefit society through applications such as drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging, renewable energy, optoelectronics, and catalysis.  These applications rely on an ability to precisely customize the surface chemistry of nanoparticles using thin-film coatings.  Nanoparticle thin-film coatings are typically on the order of a few monolayers in thickness, yet must be uniformly applied to individual nanoparticles. This award supports fundamental research into a new, high-precision thin-film nanoparticle coating strategy that overcomes current manufacturing challenges, including coating non-uniformity, by combining principles of atomic layer deposition, three-dimensional printing, and microfluidics.  Improving the uniformity of nanoparticle coatings enables new applications of functional nanoparticles across health, energy, and technology sectors.  This research award supports public engagement with nanotechnology through hands-on educational demonstrations of nanoparticle applications, with a focus on promoting inclusion for groups historically underrepresented in manufacturing research such as women and minorities.<br/> <br/>Current challenges in thin-film coating of nanoparticles include particle aggregation, non-uniform coating, limited thickness control, and undesired sensitivity to particle size and morphology.  This research award meets these challenges by combining the monolayer-by-monolayer deposition principle of conventional atomic layer deposition with the hydrodynamic nanoparticle manipulation approach known as deterministic lateral displacement to achieve a new nanomanufacturing technology termed 'Liquid Phase Atomic Layer Deposition'.  This approach represents a shift from conventional atomic layer deposition based on deposition at the solid-vapor interface to a new deposition physics based on successive adsorption and deposition reactions at the solid-liquid interface.  The research studies center on utilizing specially positioned nanoposts within a microfluidic channel to passively transport suspended nanoparticles into discrete, adjacent flow streams of successive reactant and wash solutions.  It is hypothesized that the controlled solid-liquid interface phenomena of Liquid Phase Atomic Layer Deposition yields a high degree of precision and uniformity for nanoparticle thin-film coating. The engineering of parallel three-dimensional microfluidic reactors, constructed by means of two-photon direct laser writing-based additive manufacturing, ensures that this method is also high throughput.

In particular, there is a pressing need for the development of safe, high performance, stable components for all-solid-state batteries. This project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, investigates Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), two promising electrolyte materials, which are responsible for conducting the ions used to charge the batteries. The current problem is that these materials can trap Li ions and significantly change during battery operation, which, in turn, can severely limit their lifetime. Thus, this research project visually maps where the Li ions preferentially accumulate while the batteries are being used. To do this, Leite's and Wang's groups implement complementary microscopy techniques and correlate the acquired information with measurements of device performance. The outreach/education components of this research encompass: (i) mentoring graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, (ii) incorporating the scientific findings into lectures to enrich the curriculum of the Departments of Materials Science and Engineering and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Maryland, and (iii) engaging K-12 students in STEM by providing them with hands-on experiences on batteries during the Maryland Day, an open house event that attracts more than 60,000 people to campus. <br/><br/>Technical Summary: The understanding and control of the relevant chemical reactions taking place during all-solid-state batteries cycling will enable the design of game-changing materials for energy storage based on Li, Na and Mg. This research elucidates the underlying mechanisms for the formation of solid-electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in two all-solid-state battery model systems with highly Li-ion conductive electrolytes: Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). This project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, advances the understanding of the materials chemistry that currently limits the performance of Li-ion all-solid-state batteries. The formation of SEIs is probed in situ by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), combined with ex situ X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A correlation between the electrochemical impedance and the Li distribution maps reveals how the SEIs affect the interfacial resistance and, thus, the performance of these energy storage model systems. Determining Li preferential spatial distribution during cycling can potentially transform the future design of all-solid-state batteries, with controlled SEIs. While multiple in situ experiments have validated the formation of SEI in nanoscale batteries, there are no demonstrations of the dynamics of the mesoscale Li spatial distribution within all active layers of the batteries upon lithiation/delithiation. Thus, this research has scientific impacts in the field of materials chemistry and beyond. The outreach/education components of this research encompass mentoring students at various levels; incorporating the scientific findings into the curriculum of the Departments of Materials Science and Engineering as well as Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Maryland; and engaging K-12 students in STEM by providing them with hands-on experiences on batteries during the Maryland Day, an open house event that attracts more than 60,000 people to campus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These organisms pose serious challenges to human and environmental health and cause billions of dollars in economic damages to the US every year. Numerous approaches to control populations of pest organisms currently rely on physical (trapping, deterrence), chemical (pesticides, baited traps), or biological (viruses, predators) mechanisms. These currently available methods have been unable to ""stem the tide"" in invasive pests and their application has resulted in unintended environmental impacts. There is an urgent need for control technologies that are broadly applicable, highly scalable, and cost-effective. Recent advances in precision genome editing have enabled a next generation of engineered biocontrol agents that promise to be effective while minimizing unwanted impacts on the environment. The technology on which this project is based will provide a means to prevent the reproduction of pest organisms without the introduction of toxins or pesticides. This I-Corps project will focus on mosquito control since they transmit numerous serious diseases (Zika, Dengue, etc.) that are predicted to become increasingly prevalent in the US. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the concept of engineering barriers to sexual reproduction to control pest populations. Some of the most effective pest eradication campaigns in recent history have used radiation to sterilize male pests that are then released to compete with wild males. When the sterile males mate with females, no offspring are produced and the population numbers crash. However, many species cannot be sterilized using irradiation and remain competitive when released. The solution provided in this project is to hard-wire male-sterility into the genome of the target organism using modern tools in precision genome editing. The approach has been validated in laboratory organisms, and that the required components are functional in insects, fish, plants, and mammals. Additionally, computer simulation modeling has been encouraging and suggest this approach is more robust than other technologies that rely on genome editing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Attention is now moving from identification of components to understanding the emergent, or system, behavior of the connected components.  It has been hoped that general principles would emerge via the study of mathematical models of specific systems, but to date this form of study has not generally proven effective at discovering the hidden principles of biology.  How the complex networks found in biological systems produce their emergent properties and behaviors remains elusive. Theoretical mathematics offers a possible route forward, and one which could, in time, have a profound influence on biology.  This research project aims to cut through the complexity of biological models to elucidate the general principles of cell biology.  Additionally, the project aims to develop new computational methods that can address currently infeasible problems.  There is high demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with the interest and expertise necessary to contribute to the solution of questions arising in biology; this project will provide fertile training ground for graduate students.<br/><br/>Discrete-space, continuous-time Markov chain models are commonly used to model biological interaction networks, including gene regulatory networks, viral infections, signaling systems, neuronal networks, etc. These models can be depicted via a reaction graph, which is a graphical representation of the interactions between the constituent molecules of the model. Interaction networks can be extraordinarily complex; for example, there are over 20,000 genes in the human genome and the proteins they encode may be modified in myriad ways. Further, cellular systems often have different sub-systems that operate on multiple different scales (both temporally and in terms of copy numbers), with the species operating at one scale greatly influencing those at a different scale. The reaction networks currently studied in the literature are typically so complex that numerical simulation is often considered the only way to analyze them. However, hidden within the complexity there are often underlying structures that, if properly quantified, give great insight into the dynamical or stationary behavior of the system. This project aims to develop mathematical theory that relates the emergent properties of these systems to easily-checked properties of the associated reaction graphs. A second aspect of the project is development and analysis of computational methods for stochastic models of biochemical interaction networks. The primary tools and methods utilized will be from probability theory, stochastic analysis, dynamical systems theory, chemical reaction network theory, and computational mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here, the PIs will analyze over 15 years of seismic data recorded by numerous projects in Antarctica to develop seismic structural models of the continent.  The seismic velocity models will reveal features including crustal thinning due to rifting in West Antarctica, the structures associated with mountain building, and the boundaries between different tectonic blocks. The models will be compared to continents that are better understood geologically to constrain the tectonic evolution of Antarctica. In addition, the work will provide better insight into how the solid earth interacts with and influences the development of the ice sheet. Surface heat flow will be mapped and used to identify regions in Antarctica with potential melting at the base of the ice sheet. This melt can lead to reduced friction and lower resistance to ice sheet movement.  The models will help to determine whether the earth response to ice mass changes occurs over decades, hundreds, or thousands of years. Estimates of mantle viscosity calculated from the seismic data will be used to better understand the pattern and timescales of the response of the solid earth to changes in ice mass in various parts of Antarctica.<br/><br/>The study will advance our knowledge of the structure of Antarctica by constructing two new seismic models and a thermal model using different but complementary methodologies. Because of the limitations of different seismic analysis methods, efforts will be divided between a model seeking the highest possible resolution within the upper 200 km depth in the well instrumented region (Bayesian Monte-Carlo joint inversion), and another model determining the structure of the entire continent and surrounding oceans extending through the mantle transition zone (adjoint full waveform inversion).  The Monte-Carlo inversion will jointly invert Rayleigh wave group and phase velocities from earthquakes and ambient noise correlation along with P-wave receiver functions and Rayleigh H/V ratios. The inversion will be done in a Bayesian framework that provides uncertainty estimates for the structural model. Azimuthal anisotropy will be determined from Rayleigh wave velocities, providing constraints on mantle fabric and flow patterns. The seismic data will also be inverted for temperature structure, providing estimates of lithospheric thickness and surface heat flow. The larger-scale model will cover the entire continent as well as the surrounding oceans, and will be constructed using an adjoint inversion of phase differences between three component seismograms and synthetic seismograms calculated in a 3D earth model using the spectral element method. This model will fit the entire waveforms, including body waves and both fundamental and higher mode surface waves. Higher resolution results will be obtained by using double-difference methods and by incorporating Green's functions from ambient noise cross-correlation, and solving for both radial and azimuthal anisotropy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, it will help to counter the excessive focus of research in cell and molecular biology on the animals, fungi, and land plants.  There is an enormous amount to be learned about the huge diversity of other interesting cell types, many of which are also ecologically and/or economically important.  Second, it will provide Chlamydomonas researchers not only with new biological insights but also with valuable research tools, such as improved methods for regulated transgene expression and synchronization of cell division.

It has long been thought to provide the force for furrow ingression via an actin-myosin interaction like that in muscle.  However, many cells that normally have a CAR can divide without it, as can the vast number of cell types (such as Chlamydomonas) that form furrows but have no type II myosin; thus, there must be another driver(s) of furrowing.  To elucidate these mechanisms, several related aims will be pursued.  First, a combination of microscopic, biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic methods will be used to analyze the possible roles of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.  Second, a similar combination of methods will be used to explore the possibility that the primary driver of furrow formation is localized growth of the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix.  Third, unbiased and targeted genetic screens will seek mutants with specific defects in cytokinesis; characterization of these mutants should help to reveal the underlying mechanisms that drive furrow formation.  These studies should help to elucidate both the shared mechanisms underlying the seemingly diverse modes of cytokinesis in modern organisms and the evolution of these modern mechanisms from those of ancestral cells.  Several lines of evidence suggest that the ancestral and still-core mechanism of cytokinesis is the localized deposition of new cell membrane and extracellular matrix, and that the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons play auxiliary roles in this process.  Chlamydomonas is an attractive system in which to investigate these issues.  It is evolutionarily distant from the organisms on which cytokinesis studies have previously focused; divides by furrow formation but does not have a type II myosin; has one conventional actin, one unconventional actin, and a well developed microtubule cytoskeleton; displays an enrichment of both actin and microtubules around the cleavage furrow; and has many genetic tools already available.  Its mechanisms of cytokinesis have hardly been studied, and elucidating them should contribute to a needed paradigm shift in the cytokinesis field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Efficient and high-power mid-infrared laser sources are desired for a wide range of applications, including astrophysical spectral measurements, remote sensing, gas-phase spectroscopy, and infrared countermeasures. In this proposed work, our team will investigate a new strategy for developing high-power lasers with excellent beam quality, the quantum-cascade (QC) vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser (VECSEL). Part of our team has recently developed this technology in the terahertz spectral region (wavelengths greater than 60 microns), in this project we will re-envision the concept for the shorter mid-infrared wavelengths. We propose a suite of approaches tailored for the various spectral sub-regions that comprise the mid-infrared, including the very-long-wave-infrared (VLWIR) spectral region (16-28 micron wavelength), the long-wave infrared (LWIR) (8-13 micron wavelength), and the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) (4-5 micron wavelength). This work is a GOALI university-industry collaboration between the PI at UCLA and an industrial partner at Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems.

This is proposed as path for (a) high brightness mid-IR sources with scalable output power (up to tens of watts) in a circular diffraction-limited beam, and (b) a platform for multifunctional lasers associated with the ability to locally engineer the amplitude, phase, and polarization response of the metasurface. We propose a set of distinct approaches tailored for the various spectral sub-regions that comprise the mid-IR. The intellectual merit in the proposed work is present on multiple levels. The primary innovation is the development of novel schemes for implementing VECSELs for mid-infrared quantum-cascade lasers, in particular in the MWIR and LWIR based upon surface-emitting gratings. The broader impacts are addressed at several levels including undergraduate and graduate research experiences, dissemination of results, technology advancement, outreach to underrepresented minorities, and industrial interaction. Outreach to underrepresented minorities (URM) will specifically occur through the PI?s development of research projects for a course designed for the recruitment and retention of URM engineering freshman.

While DISC systems help to address the scalability challenges of big data analytics, they also introduce an enormous challenge for data scientists in understanding and resolving errors. This project addresses the severe lack of debugging support in DISC systems today, which makes it difficult for data scientists to understand their applications, determine the causes of identified errors, and ensure that such errors are properly repaired. <br/> <br/>The research provides two kinds of debugging support for big data processing programs in modern DISC systems like Apache Spark: new interactive, real-time debugging primitives for large-scale distributed processing and tool-assisted fault-localization services for big data. Technical approaches include a new data provenance technique for providing fine-grained visibility into large-scale distributed data processing and runtime optimizations for iterative development and debugging workloads. Tool-assisted fault localization services leverage these underlying provenance and optimization techniques to pinpoint and characterize the root causes of errors efficiently. Big data analytics is increasingly important in the 21st century, where daily lives leave behind a detailed digital record and decision-makers of all kinds, from companies to government agencies, would like to base their actions on data.

For many problems in practice, data is commonly associated with certain coherent and nonlinear structure. Mathematically, this allows us to model data sets as points sampled on manifolds usually of low dimensions embedded in a high dimensional ambient space. Different from image and signal processing which handle functions on flat domains with well-developed tools for processing and learning, manifold-structured data is far more challenging due to their complicated geometry. For example, the same geometric object can take very different coordinate representations due to the variety of embeddings, transformations or representations (imagine the same human body shape can have different poses as its nearly isometric embedding ambiguities). These ambiguities form an infinite dimensional isometric group and make higher-level tasks in manifold-structured data analysis and learning even more challenging. To overcome these challenges, it becomes increasingly important to develop new tools in both theoretical and computational point of views for processing manifold structured data. <br/><br/>This project proposes to investigate analyzing and learning of manifold-structured data by bridging connection from geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) and learning theory to intrinsic data analysis. The major objectives of this project contain three components. The first part is to investigate a framework of geometric-PDEs-based methods to a data structure for manifolds represented as incomplete inter-point distance. The second part is to overcome the challenge of poor performance using intrinsic descriptors to handling not nearly isometric manifolds. In the third part, a new method of defining geometric convolution on manifolds is considered. This provides a building block of constructing the proposed geometric convolutional neural network for conducting deep learning on manifold-structured data. By collaborating with biomedical engineers, applications such as human brain mappings will also be explored. The new methodologies and research findings resulting from the proposed work will lead to new ways of tackling problems in manifold-structured data analysis and will be integrated into my future teaching and course projects in appropriate ways. The education plan is to provide unique opportunities to train undergraduate and graduate students interested in exploring geometry and learning on manifold-structured data, and to reach out the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, spin glass models are very often cited as examples of complex systems and the corresponding research has been of great use in understanding many real-world problems emerging from, such as, computer science, data science, and many others.

Microbial fermentation represents an attractive option for production of fuels and valuable chemicals from renewable resources, and glucaric acid can be produced from glucose, a renewable biomass-derived resource.  The glucaric acid market was estimated at $550M in 2016, and has a plethora of uses ranging from detergents to food ingredients, corrosion inhibitors, and de-icing applications.  The proposed project will engineer improved productivity of the microbe using C5/C6 sugars, thus accelerating the production of low-cost, high-purity glucaric acid. Achieving these bioprocess improvements will facilitate widespread adoption of bio-based glucaric acid in a variety of markets, broadening opportunity for US products. These applications include coatings, foams and foaming aids, electrolytes, gels, polymers, and polymer additives.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to perform multi-omics studies to characterize the physiology of E. coli strains producing glucaric acid via fermentation, and develop strain engineering strategies to enable high yield and productivity. Most fermentation products are highly reduced compared to the starting sugar, and care must be taken to maintain cells in a reduced state, meaning high NADH/NAD ratio, to drive the NADH-consuming biosynthetic reactions. Products that are derived from sugar oxidation, in contrast, pose a much different challenge, and have been explored to a much lesser extent. Here, additional oxygen is needed to accept the excess electrons generated during glucose oxidation. It is well known that both S. cerevisiae and E. coli, two of the most common organisms for industrial application, are limited in their electron transport chain capacity, resulting in overflow products from high glucose uptake rates. Regardless of the oxygen transfer ability of the fermentation equipment, there is an inherent maximum production rate of these organisms. In this project, the plan is to develop E. coli strains with increased respiration capacity, thus increasing the maximum glucose oxidation rate. Glucaric acid, which can be produced from glucose via 3 enzymatic reaction steps, is an exemplary product.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ocean is the most important reservoir of oxygen on Earth's surface. Its isotopic composition varies with ice volume and is influenced by interactions with the solid Earth on million-year timescales. Marine minerals record these variations: they inherit the oceans' oxygen-isotope composition. Marine mineral systems, however, show long-term secular variations that are not easily explained by changes in temperature or ocean isotopic composition exclusively. The ocean is thought to be buffered by high- and low-temperature interactions between seawater and seafloor rocks. If these interactions do not vary on billion-year timescales, the oxygen-isotope compositions of marine sedimentary rocks mostly relate to changes in seawater temperature and global ice volume. However, if these interactions do vary there could be a secular change in the oxygen isotope composition of seawater toward heavier compositions. By measuring the triple-oxygen isotope composition of ancient chert samples, it will be possible to constrain oceanic oxygen isotope compositions and ultimately advance our understanding of the surface environment throughout Earth history. The PI will work with undergraduates on research projects and provide outreach to local schools through career day events.<br/><br/>Recent experimental results have demonstrated that silica, precipitated under most common Earth surface conditions, forms with a predictable temperature dependent offset in oxygen isotope composition from the water which its oxygen was ultimately derived. In practice, the oxygen fractionation based geothermometer system depends on the assumption of the oxygen of the water. By constraining this relationship, it is possible to fully constrain the oxygen isotopes and temperature which the silica formed from. However, because marine cherts are nearly ubiquitously diagenetically altered it is necessary to determine what effects, if any, there will be on the determination of seawater oxygen using this method. The effects of diagenetic alteration of marine cherts will be done through the characterization and triple oxygen isotope analysis of silica phases from the Miocene to Pliocene Monterey and Sisquoc formations of Southern California where three phases of silica (Opal-A, Opal-CT and microquartz) are known to exist.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These technologies are allowing a renewable resource to enter into areas of construction that were previously not feasible due to a variety of technical constraints. Despite the promise that mass timber holds, wood is ultimately a natural material with inherent variability and peculiarities. Before a new engineered wood product can be brought to market, extensive and expensive laboratory testing is required to establish its reliable properties. This project will enhance the opportunities for increased use of timber by understanding the fundamental mechanics necessary for accurate performance prediction, including response and behavior under extreme events.  The work will exploit advances in both computational modeling and materials characterization techniques, such that structural performance can be reliably predicted.  The outcomes of the work will benefit both the manufacturers of wood products, by allowing them to better optimize their fiber resource, and the architects and engineers who develop new structural systems.  For these parties, the new predictive capability will streamline both structural/architectural innovation and product development. Existing ties with both the wood products industry and the architectural community will ensure appropriate dissemination of results.<br/><br/>In order to realize the above outcomes, specific research activities will focus on a computational framework that will feature a novel mechanisms-based, isogeometric embedded-lattice model approximating the internal structure of mass timber. It will simulate the mechanical behavior at multiple scales including the effect of interfaces and defects. This computational model, which explicitly incorporates material morphology, will be calibrated through an experimental program that isolates and measures the micro- and meso-scale morphological features that dictate material behavior, and it will be validated through structural component-scale testing. Since the approach is designed to capture the physical mechanisms that dictate behavior, larger scale phenomena, such as size effects, will be predicted as a natural outcome of the simulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI proposes that factorization homology should provide a unified approach to the first three problems, and that the evidence gained from these should inform the approach to the fourth. The PI also plans to investigate spaces of divisors following the principle articulated by Ellenberg, Venkatesh, and Westerland in their proof of the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics for function fields.

It allows quantitation of molecules in the whole volume of a specimen, and has proven to be invaluable in the studies of cell metabolism, brain function, and developmental biology. The simplest way to image a volume is through optical sectioning in the axial direction. Such a method requires tightly focused laser beams and good axial sectioning capability. One approach for volumetric imaging is through tomography, in which images are collected from many different angles around the sample. The 3D information can be then reconstructed using the angle-dependent images. Professor Cheng develops a Bessel-beam-based stimulated Raman projection (SRP) microscopy and tomography for high-speed volumetric chemical imaging. The SRP method is built upon the concept that the detected signal is an integration of SRS intensity along the Rayleigh length of the input Bessel beams, which remain their focuses along axial direction for a long distance. Compared to the Gaussian beam SRS microscopy, the Bessel beam SRP microscopy is able to quantify the total chemical compositions of a 3D volume in a 2D scan.

Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers. Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign includes several education and outreach activities including support for undergraduates to participate in fieldwork and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education.  Work performed under this award fosters international scientific collaboration with scientists in Colombia and Costa Rica and helps to develop local infrastructure for rainwater collection and isotopic analysis.<br/><br/>The eight week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  Work performed here augments the aircraft observations through the collection and analysis of rainwater samples from ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce. Vertical structure is a key property of tropical convection that determines its evolution and its interactions with the circulation and thermodynamics of the surrounding atmosphere.  The vertical structure can be simply characterized as top- or bottom-heavy, according to the relative amounts of rising motion that occur in the upper and lower troposphere.<br/><br/>Work conducted here seeks to determine the vertical structure of tropical convection by measuring the ratios of stable isotopes in rainwater produced by it.  Rainwater is almost entirely composed of ordinary H2O, but it contains trace amounts of water in which deuterium (D) replaces hydrogen (H) to form HDO, or oxygen-18 replaces oxygen-16.  These heavier isotopes condense more readily than ordinary H2O and are thus more common in raindrops formed lower rather than higher in the troposphere.  The relative abundance of heavier isotopes in raindrops should thus provide a means to determine if they formed in top-heavy or bottom-heavy convection. Rainwater collection for isotopic analysis is planned at three sites in Colombia: Nuqui, on the west coast; Quibdo, further inland; and Isla San Andres, in the southwest Caribbean. Estimates of convective vertical profiles from isotopic composition are compared with estimates from aircraft measurements to determine if the method works.  Further examination of the isotopic data would be conducted using numerical simulations from a variety of atmospheric models including some in which tracer ""particles"" representing water vapor are tracked as they rise through cloud systems and ultimately condense.<br/><br/>A further goal of the research is to understand the transition from shallow to deep convection, a critical component of the lifecycle of convective clouds.  Three contributing factors in the transition are examined: the gradual moistening of the atmospheric boundary layer; organization of the subcloud layer, which allows cloud roots to form in air which has greater moisture than the large-scale mean; and cold pools formed by convective downdrafts, which organize the subcloud layer to produce larger cloud roots which are in turn less susceptible to the diluting effect of dry air entrainment. The third of these factors may lead to a positive feedback, in which convective downdrafts organize the subcloud layer in a way that further promotes convection.  Better characterization of entrainment is of particular interest over the southwest Caribbean, as midtropospheric air in this region is quite dry yet convection still occurs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, Einstein wrote his famous field equations in the language of tensors on manifolds, and these equations have since been well studied by mathematicians and physicists alike.  Certainly, besides being fundamental in general relativity, differential geometry is  also very useful in other fields of science, such as in control theory,  in computer vision, data analysis, and many others. For this reason, understanding the structure of manifolds is a fundamental problem in science. This project will focus on the behavior of geometric flows on manifolds. A typical example of a geometric flow is the heat equation, which describes the distribution of heat in a region over time.  This proposal studies a more advanced form of the heat equation, called the Ricci flow. A Riemannian metric on a manifold tells us about the shape of that object, how to measure angles and distances. The Ricci flow is a heat-type equation for Riemannian metrics. It is hoped, and confirmed in some cases, that the Ricci flow will evolve a given metric on a manifold to an improved one, such as an Einstein metric. However, a major difference between this theory and that of the standard heat equation is that the Ricci flow is a non-linear equation, and as such it usually develops singularities after some time. When such singularities are understood, the process may be continued. This has played a central role in the proof of the long-standing Poincare conjecture about the topology of three dimensional manifolds.  The main goal of this project is to understand such singularities in dimension four, and to investigate the implications of our findings to the structure of four dimensional manifolds.  Because Ricci flow can be seen as the renormalization group flow in string theory, there are other possible applications of this study to theoretical physics. Other related flows, like the mean curvature flow, have further remarkable applications to other fields, such as in computer visualization, for eliminating noise, or in metallurgy, for heat treatment of metals. The outreach components of this project disseminate the results to general public and contribute to the development of young talent.<br/><br/>Ricci flow was introduced by Richard Hamilton in the early eighties, in a fundamental work devoted to understanding positively curved three dimensional manifolds. It became clear later that if one flows an arbitrary metric on a given manifold, the flow will generally develop singularities. One needs to understand these singularities in order to continue the flow, and to not lose any significant topological information about the space. The singularities of Ricci flow are modeled by Ricci solitons, which are fixed points of the flow, modulo diffeomorphisms and scaling. Three-dimensional shrinking Ricci solitons have been classified through the work of Hamilton, Ivey and Perelman. This has important consequences to understanding the behavior of Ricci flow with surgeries on three-dimensional manifolds, and indeed, for the resolution of the Poincare conjecture. The main goal of this project is to classify four-dimensional complete noncompact Ricci solitons. This will be achieved through a complete understanding of the asymptotic geometry of these spaces and through studying corresponding rigidity questions. It is expected that this project will advance our insight on the behavior of Ricci flow in dimension four, which will enable a Ricci flow approach to some important questions about the topology of four dimensional manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When the ice sheet collapsed, those fresh lake waters were released to the Atlantic Ocean, and are thought to have disrupted ocean circulation, causing abrupt cold spells in the northern hemisphere, and perhaps globally.  Near southern Ontario and northern New York State, enormous Glacial Lake Iroquois contained massive amounts of cold fresh water, and modern remnants of that lake include Lake Ontario and Oneida Lake.  Oneida Lake is located near the easternmost part of ancient Glacial Lake Iroquois, and this area and the Mohawk Valley were a key valve for the release of meltwaters to the Hudson River and to the Atlantic.  The Oneida Lake project will study the ancient sediments laid down during these meltwater releases, to determine their precise timing, and will then compare those timings to past climate records derived from Greenland ice cores and from sediments from the Southern and the Atlantic Oceans.  The researchers will use geophysical (sonar) methods to image the sediments below the bottom of Oneida Lake, and then collect sediment cores for detailed analyses.  Special Carbon-14 dating techniques will be used to date sediments in the cores and to correlate the layered sediments to similar records previously collected in New England.  Project outreach efforts include a public lecture series for lake-side communities, engagements with Oneida Nation high school science classes, and the installation of science information kiosks at a State Park on the lake?s eastern edge.<br/><br/>This project is examining the Late Quaternary sediment record from the Oneida Basin in Upstate New York, through analyses of new geophysical data and new sediment cores. The unusually rich stratigraphic archive will constrain the paleoclimate evolution along the SE margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in the terminal Pleistocene. The researchers will also develop an energy balance hydrologic model of ancient Glacial Lake Iroquois to better constrain fill and discharge events from this basin. Non-linear episodes that perturb the global climate system (e.g., the Younger Dryas cooling) include major meltwater pulses and drainage pathway switches associated with Glacial Lake Iroquois and its precursors. The researchers will evaluate Termination I (the end of the last glaciation, ~20,000 years ago) at seasonal resolution over several millennia, using the rich varved sediment record in Oneida Lake and surrounding outcrops. Outcrop observations of newly discovered lake sediment exposures (varves) in the basin will be integrated with correlative sedimentary sequences recovered by cores from Oneida Lake. The glacial varve record will be chronologically constrained via paleomagnetic methods (cross-dating) with the North American Varve Chronology and further fixed by selective use of Ramped PyrOx radiocarbon dating of organic matter and separately of pollen 14C dating. Preliminary high-resolution seismic data reveal a remarkable, high-fidelity stratigraphy with evidence for outburst flood events, ice sheet instabilities, and a continuous time series from deglaciation through the Holocene. The full lake will be surveyed at high spatial resolution using CHIRP (sweep signal seismic) and multichannel seismic reflection methods. The calibrated time series of events will be compared to three well-established global archives: the Greenland ice core record, the Antarctic Peninsula Palmer Deep and Cariaco Basin marine sections. Beyond the direct scientific outcomes and graduate student training, the researchers will mount an outreach effort including: 1) a riparian community lecture series; 2) construction of two information kiosks describing the geologic evolution of Glacial Lake Iroquois and subsequent evolution of Oneida Lake at two lakeside parks; and 3) engage under-represented groups including secondary school students from the Oneida Nation during both field and laboratory activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory of operator algebras was introduced by John von Neumann in order to provide a proper mathematical framework for Quantum Mechanics.  The non-commutativity which is a key feature of Quantum Mechanics, is an important aspect of operator algebras.  Vaughan Jones's subfactor theory is built on this non-commutative framework. Conformal field theory (CFT) is a theory describing critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, and it also plays an important role in string theory. In recent years there have been remarkable interactions between subfactors  and conformal field theory that have led to many interesting mathematical issues. The aim of this project is to find solutions to some of the important mathematical issues that surface in this context which have a wide range of applications in both mathematics and quantum physics.<br/><br/>Subfactor theory provides an entry point into a world of mathematics and physics containing large parts of conformal field theory, quantum algebras and low dimensional topology. The research objective of this project is to develop further the connection between these subjects, and to find applications in the other area of mathematics. The project will rely on operator algebraic and subfactor techniques developed in studying CFT, including insights about old and new problems provided by the general framework of subfactors. The project's focus will be on the questions around the reconstruction program which are strongly motivated by recent construction of subfactors. In some cases there are strong indications that the subfactors come from CFT in certain ways that have been well established based on principal investigator's work. Solutions of the problems that are proposed would have important applications in diverse areas of mathematics.

The goal of this project is to overcome the diffraction limit by exploiting nonlinearities from a modern signal processing perspective. This project will lay out theoretical, algorithmic, and instrumentation foundation for nonlinear diffractive imaging. The outcome of this project can open up many possibilities of high-resolution imaging in highly scattering media that are ubiquitous in science and medicine, including histology, cytometry, brain mapping, and drug discovery.

This study of curvature is important in all domains of science and engineering. For example, the theory of general relativity posits that gravity curves space and time in a mathematically precise manner, while in materials science, the meeting points between crystal structures are modeled by (a rather different notion of) curvature. This project is concerned with the study of a particular measure of bending called scalar curvature. Scalar curvature is one of the simplest measures of bending, but due to this simplicity scalar curvature can contain only a limited amount of information. Hence, we must study scalar curvature through highly indirect means. One way to explore scalar curvature is in relation to the isoperimetric problem: in a given space, how can we enclose the largest amount of volume with the smallest perimeter? This is one of the oldest mathematical questions, but its link to scalar curvature is only recently beginning to be understood. The PI's project will continue the study of scalar curvature as it affects the large-scale behavior of area and volume, with particular emphasis on the relationship between such topics and problems related to general relativity. In addition to this research, this project will also support the PI's continued efforts to promote student learning and training through seminar organization, conferences, and summer schools, as well as expository articles and notes.  <br/><br/>A major component of the research plan is the continued study of the link between large-scale variational problems and scalar curvature, motivated by geometric and physical considerations such as the Penrose inequality and static uniqueness questions from general relativity. To this end, the PI plans to continue his investigation of global uniqueness questions related to scalar curvature and the isoperimetric problem. Recently, several such problems have been understood in three dimensions, using a combination of powerful tools from geometric analysis (many of which are limited to three dimensions). One portion of the research will consist of investigating higher dimensional analogues of these results, which will necessitate the development of a wide array of new techniques. The ideas developed in these aforementioned global uniqueness works have also led to other (a priori unrelated) topics that the PI will investigate. For example, determining the validity of the Minkowski inequality for non-convex surfaces (possibly with an additional bending term) is related to the uniqueness question for large stable constant mean curvature surfaces in asymptotically flat manifolds. Similarly, an invariant related to the least area in the homology class of a torus for certain Riemannian three-manifolds with non-negative scalar curvature is related to the rigidity of area-minimizing cylinders in three-manifolds of non-negative scalar curvature. In a different (but related) direction, this project will also include investigation of the relationship between the geometry and topology of minimal surfaces, including the study of surfaces with simple topology or small index.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whenever biological oscillators interact, they mutually adjust their rhythms, that is, they synchronize. This synchronization needs to be fine-tuned. For example, too much of synchronization between neural cells is associated with motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, too little is associated with impaired cognition. This research project will investigate the mechanisms of how biological oscillators go in and out of synch in time, an important problem that has not been extensively studied. Biological systems are very adaptable to the changes in the environment, and this research will explore associations between adaptability and dynamics of synchrony. The study will utilize mathematical and computational models of neural and other biological oscillators, complemented by the analysis of available experimental data. The project aims to clarify the mechanisms of synchronization in neural and other living systems. Importantly, this will not only assist in understanding of healthy normal functioning of biological oscillators, but will also advance understanding of mechanisms of pathologies -- much-needed knowledge for the treatments of several brain disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease, addiction, and schizophrenia) and other pathological conditions. In addition, young scholars will be engaged in this research and will get critical experience in biomathematics, contributing to the preparation of a modern workforce able to tackle life sciences questions with mathematical techniques.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, oscillations and synchrony are recognized as important mechanisms underlying many physiological phenomena, in particular neural ones. Excessively strong or weak synchrony is associated with several neurological and neuropsychiatric dysfunctions. Neural synchrony frequently varies in time. Few long-desynchronized dynamics intervals may be functionally different from many short desynchronizations, although the average synchrony may be the same. Recent studies of different neural systems reported the strong prevalence of short desynchronizations. This research will explore the nature and function of these short desynchronizations in neural systems and analyze temporal patterning of synchrony in other living systems. Several questions will be answered: What are the mechanisms of short desynchronizations in neural systems? What function do they serve? What changes in the patterning of synchrony may lead to what dysfunctions? What are the differences in the temporal patterning of synchrony in neural and non-neural living systems? Mathematical techniques will explain how the patterning of synchrony contributes to the adaptability and efficiency of living systems. From a mathematical standpoint, the project will advance understanding of how some experimentally-relevant universal dynamics may emerge in a class of moderately-coupled neural-like oscillators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will examine how family, culture, and geographical locations shape the manner in which children form their identity in nature.  The project will enhance understanding of how children learn to regulate their emotions in nature,  and  it will expand knowledge about the role education plays in shaping how children develop empathy and care for living and non-living aspects of their natural environments.

How do children's experiences in the Alaska wilderness affect development over time? Research will occur in rural and non-rural Alaska during the spring and autumn seasons. The study will include children from a small isolated Alaskan village where the majority of families are of Alaska Native descent, and where access to consumer goods is limited. The study will also examine the experiences of non-Native children growing up in an Alaskan city.

Thinking about systems is increasingly important for students to understand complex topics in science and engineering.  Building models based on evidence is important for helping students think critically in general, and about complex systems ideas in particular. To support students in these efforts, the project develops an easy-to-use software modeling tool that supports students in creating models while concurrently indicating the sources of evidence (data, simulations, etc.) that support their model-building choices. The products of this project, which include software, curriculum, and assessments, increase the capacity to engage young learners in ambitious science educational experiences that are consistent with the Next Generation Science Standards. Outcomes of the project include professional development materials, scaffolding tools, and assessments which will be made freely available via the project website. This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program.<br/><br/>This project transforms the way simulations are used to help students develop scientific practices, epistemologies, and content knowledge within elementary school science classrooms. It explores how 5th grade students treat simulations as similar to and distinct from other sources of evidence when engaged in scientific inquiry. By carefully selecting disparate and sometimes contradictory forms of evidence, the project challenges students to reflect upon their beliefs about how simulations of scientific concepts both do, and do not reflect the phenomena under study. Building on past work, the project is developing a scaffolded framework for teaching students about complex systems concepts in the context of aquatic ecosystems. This software and associated curriculum aims to help students engage deeply with the specific biology content, the important cross-cutting systems concepts that it represents, and the crucial scientific practices that are involved in constructing scientific models based on multiple disparate forms of evidence. This project will therefore focus on two of the key cross-cutting concepts from the Next Generation Science Standards--systems thinking and scientific practices. The project investigates the efficacy of posited scaffolds and interventions through three complementary approaches: tutoring studies in more controlled settings with smaller sample sizes,  design experiments in five fifth-grade classrooms, and a quasi-experimental study. The classroom design experiments and experimental studies are carried out in diverse educational settings in Indiana and New Jersey. Outcomes measured include both student growth and discourse and interactions from video analysis.  Measures of student growth include interviews and written student artifacts.  Measures of discourse and interactions are coded as variables derived from video analysis. The findings support designers, researchers, and educators who not only make use of simulations in science curricula, but help situate them within robust scientific practices and habits of mind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Little is known about what types of professional development (PD) support teachers' improved practice and student learning. However, federal, state, and local governments spend resources on helping teachers improve their teaching practice and students' learning. PD programs vary in their intent and can fall on a continuum from highly adaptive, with great latitude in the implementation, to highly specified, with little ability to adapt the program during implementation. The project will study the design and development of PD that supports teacher development and student learning, and provide accumulation of evidence to inform teacher educators, administrators, teachers, and policymakers of factors associated with successful PD experiences and variation across teachers and types of PDs. The impact study will expand on the evidence of promise from four 2015 National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded projects - two adaptive, two specified - to provide evidence of the impact of the projects on teachers' instructional practice over time. Although the four projects are different in terms of structure and design elements, they all share the goal to support challenging mathematics content, practice standards, and differentiation techniques to support culturally and linguistically diverse, underrepresented populations. Understanding the nature of the professional development including structure and design elements, and unpacking what teachers take up and use in their instructional practice potentially has widespread use to support student learning in diverse contexts, especially those serving disadvantaged and underrepresented student populations. This project is funded by the Discovery Research PreK-12 Program, which funds research and development on STEM innovations and approaches. <br/><br/>This study will examine teachers' uptake of mathematics content, pedagogy and materials from different types of professional development in order to understand and unpack the factors that are associated with what teachers take up and use two-three years beyond their original PD experience: Two specified 1) An Efficacy Study of the Learning and Teaching Geometry PD Materials: Examining Impact and Context-Based Adaptations (Jennifer Jacobs, Karen Koellner & Nanette Seago), 2) Visual Access to Mathematics: Professional Development for Teachers of English Learners (Mark Driscoll, Johanna Nikula, & Pamela Buffington), two adaptive: 3) Refining a Model with Tools to Develop Math PD Leaders: An Implementation Study (Hilda Borko & Janet Carlson), 4), TRUmath and Lesson Study: Supporting Fundamental and Sustainable Improvement in High School Mathematics Teaching (Suzanne Donovan, Phil Tucher, & Catherine Lewis). The project will utilize a multi-case method which centers on a common focus of what content, pedagogy and materials teachers take up from PD experiences. Using a specified sampling procedure, the project will select 8 teachers from each of the four PD projects to serve as case study teachers. Subsequently, the project will conduct a cross case analysis focusing on variation among and between teachers and different types of PD. The research questions that guide the project's impact study are: RQ1: What is the nature of what teachers take up and use after participating in professional development workshops? RQ2: What factors influence what teachers take up and use and in what ways?

We can make this work much better by imposing conditions on these functions. One of the most important options is to ask that for a function that can determined by its values on smaller pieces. This perspective is very powerful and informs approaches to many topological invariants, but important invariants associated to fixed point theory have escaped its reach.  The goal of this project is to rectify this and use the tools that prioritize this additivity to further develop fixed point invariants.  The project also supports the PI's work with the socioeconomically diverse graduate student population at the University of Kentucky.  The PI has worked to build a community where students can identify difficulties, feel comfortable asking questions, and learn to effectively advocate for themselves. <br/><br/>The additivity of the Euler characteristic is one of the most important properties of this very important invariant. One way to capture this additivity is to observe that the Euler characteristic can be understood as the image of a class in algebraic K-theory. Classically, the generalizations of the Euler characteristic that relate to topological fixed point theory ignored the significance of additivity. The work in this project seeks to rectify this omission. Previous results suggest two to approaches to this goal. The first recognizes that the Reidemeister trace, a refinement of the Euler characteristic that gives a converse to the Lefschetz fixed point theorem, takes values in topological Hochschild homology. Topological Hochschild homology receives a map from topological restriction homology and it seems likely that the Reidemeister trace will lift through this map to a topologically meaningful class in topological restriction homology. An alternative approach is to start with the question of understanding K-theory of endomorphisms of modules over E-infinity ring spectra. From here the goal is to describe connections between the cyclotomic trace and trace in bicategories and symmetric monodial categories.  In all of this work it also important to ground the results in topological meaning - to verify that classes constructed in these various groups are invariants associated to interesting questions. For example, these constructions should start by giving interesting invariants for periodic points and possibly extend to invariants for dynamical systems. This perspective also fits within a longer term goal of use fixed point theory as a test case for new methods of producing additive invariants that arise from wrong-way-maps or transfers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of algebraic topology is to systematically build a connection between algebraic objects like numbers and geometric objects like spaces. This connection allows a two-way flow of information, with algebraic invariants distinguishing spaces and topological methods informing algebraic problems. Starting from foundational work of Quillen, algebraic and algebraic geometry data like formal groups gives rise to new invariants for spaces with striking properties. This project combines this classical thread with much more recent developments coming from equivariant algebraic topology. ""Equivariant algebraic topology"" remembers a collection of symmetries inherent in a space as part of the data, systematically grouping spaces with the same symmetries, and the numbers and invariants produced must reflect this. This extra structure provides more nuanced computations, giving more information about how the classically described invariants change under symmetries. Equivariant algebraic topology has experience a renaissance recently dues to the solution by the PI, Hopkins, and Ravenel to the Kervaire Invariant One problem, one of the oldest outstanding problems in algebraic topology. The solution introduced a host of new constructions and techniques that have striking ramifications in classical and equivariant algebraic topology, and the problems in this project focus on unpacking some of these new constructions and describing what they mean for algebraic topology in general. Many of the projects focus on diversity in STEM. The PI is currently developing tools to help others build a conference series for graduate students and develop their own conferences for younger researchers to attract them to a field. The PI is also in discussions with an HBCU about building more direct connections between their students and the PI's institutions, starting with electronic seminars to introduce students to active researchers in algebraic topology. The goal of these collaborations is to have more students from underrepresented groups enter and succeed in graduate programs in algebraic topology. Finally, the PI has developed and continues to refine a First Year seminar on ""Women in Math.""  The seminar connects students with female mathematicians, allowing the students the opportunity to hear about their research and experience.<br/><br/>Modern stable homotopy theory heavily utilizes the fact that the stable homotopy category behaves like a derived category of modules. The ground ring here is the sphere spectrum, and computing its homotopy groups is one of the overarching themes in the subject. The problem can be approached by first looking p-locally, and we can pass to the p-local stable homotopy category. Here algebraic geometry provides a further refinement via the theory of formal groups, a cornerstone of algebraic topology.  The current approach to understanding monochromatic homotopy is via certain homotopy fixed points computations. Computing the homotopy groups of fixed points and homotopy fixed points is very difficult in general. One of the most exciting new tools developed to solve the Kervaire problem is a general slice filtration, a method which directly computes homotopy groups of fixed points. For Real Landweber exact theories, this is an extremely efficient tool. For larger groups, computations are still tractable but much more mysterious. In all cases, many of the conceptual tools from non-equivariant homotopy are not available. Many of the techniques developed for stable equivariant homotopy can also be applied unstably. This gives a natural and geometric notion of ""even"" which refines the ordinary one non-equivariantly and which encompasses spaces related to Real bordism and its norms.  The PI expects to see a close connection between unstable even spaces, various orientations by norms of Real bordism, and Mackey functor objects in algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The range of these phenomena includes such diverse examples as complex and compressible fluids (combustion, aerospace engineering, and meteorology), nonlocal reaction-diffusion processes (nuclear physics, population biology, and genetics), and kinetic theory (plasma physics, swarm dynamics, and astrophysics). This project focuses on novel approaches to determining two fundamental characteristics of solutions to equations modeling large numbers of strongly interacting particles: their regularity and asymptotic behavior. The regularity of such problems establishes that the models are well-behaved, which often means the equations remain numerically tractable in computer simulations. The asymptotic theory seeks to find simplified limiting behavior for equations, in which many complex interactions average out and have a residual effect that governs the behavior of the system. Information about the limiting behavior is instrumental for applications such as medical imaging or materials science. For many important phenomena that demonstrate complex, nonlinear behavior, the application of known methods for analysis and control is greatly limited and not always possible. The aim of this project is to investigate three new techniques that partly overcome the difficulties caused by nonlinearity. The project will also provide training and research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The principal investigator will use techniques of nonlinear analysis, viscosity theory, and probability to establish bounds and asymptotic dynamics for the three major parts of the project. The first part focuses on exploring thermally enhanced dissipation for hydrodynamic equations where the viscosity grows with local temperature. From kinetic considerations and empirical observations, the kinematic viscosity of a compressible fluid flow increases with the local temperature and the local temperature is produced by friction. The intuition is that, in such models, regions of high turbulence self-regularize by producing hot spots which boost the viscosity exactly where it is needed to prevent the development of singularities. Prior work has identified this effect in two model problems (along with corresponding bounds). One of the main goals of the project is to push these types of estimates to physical models of compressible thermal fluids such as the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, the equations of magneto-hydrodynamics, and the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Fourier system for electrokinetic complex fluids. Enhanced thermal dissipation is a truly novel source of regularization compared to other known energy-based methods and lends itself naturally to dynamic weighted Sobolev estimates and entropy methods. The second part focuses on developing methods to extract asymptotic behavior from strongly nonlocal heterogeneous reaction-diffusion equations. There is a growing interest in extracting simpler macroscopic dynamics (often taking the form of geometric equations) from certain scaling limits of more complicated models. The nonlocal operators in these models present unique challenges in determining their residual impact on the (sometimes discontinuous) homogenized equation. The investigator plans to implement the techniques of viscosity theory to pursue homogenization phenomena for nonlocal periodic Fisher-KPP and bistable (Allen-Cahn) equations. The third part focuses on the regularity theory for kinetic equations (i.e., Landau and Boltzmann). Most regularity results for these equations rely on the assumption of having the lower bound on the density (as this often yields a minimum dissipation in the velocity variables). The investigator will explore the emergence of such lower bounds through probabilistic techniques, writing the kinetic equation as an approximate Fokker-Planck equation for a certain stochastic process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These behaviors can be exploited for engineering new classes of optoelectronic devices with novel functionalities. The goal of this research project is to investigate a class of such extremely thin materials that are only one or few atomic layers thick, and seek to endow them with specific magnetic and electronic properties. The team envisions a material that, at the flip of a switch, can become electrically conducting or insulating, magnetic or non-magnetic. Such a material would be vital for the development of new technologies such as high-density memory storage devices and ultra-sensitive magnetic or optical sensors. These research efforts are integrated with plans to mentor and train the next generation of physicists and material scientists. In addition, both team members are active in recruiting and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented groups, while also reaching out to high school teachers and students. The team collaborates with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory  at Florida State University to develop hands-on instructional materials for schools in surrounding North Florida counties.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The ultimate goal of this research project is the achievement of gate-tunable ferromagnetism due to half-metallicity in monolayer and few-layer metal monochalcogenides, based on a recent theoretical proposal. These compounds, i.e. (In,Ga)(S, Se, Te), have been shown to exhibit high-room-temperature carrier mobility, thickness-dependent band gaps and high photoresponsivities. Although monochalcogenides are nonmagnetic, a recent first principles calculation predicts spin-split valence bands in their monolayers, with both the magnetic moment and the spin polarization energy depending strongly on density. Thus, a normal metal-ferromagnet-normal metal transition is expected as the hole density is tuned, with ferromagnetism and half-metallicity emerging when atomically thin monochalcogenides are hole-doped to ~10^13/cm^2. This research project strives to achieve this ambitious goal by overcoming a number of critical challenges, including synthesis of high quality material, device fabrication and optimization, and efficient gating techniques. Successful implementation of the research plan is expected to lead to new half-metallic systems that can be combined with other layered compounds in heterostructures to produce novel functionalities. In addition to training graduate students, both principal investigators continue their established efforts at mentoring undergraduate and high school students, while also recruiting and mentoring students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Functional nanoparticles have the potential to benefit society through applications such as drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging, renewable energy, optoelectronics, and catalysis.  These applications rely on an ability to precisely customize the surface chemistry of nanoparticles using thin-film coatings.  Nanoparticle thin-film coatings are typically on the order of a few monolayers in thickness, yet must be uniformly applied to individual nanoparticles. This award supports fundamental research into a new, high-precision thin-film nanoparticle coating strategy that overcomes current manufacturing challenges, including coating non-uniformity, by combining principles of atomic layer deposition, three-dimensional printing, and microfluidics.  Improving the uniformity of nanoparticle coatings enables new applications of functional nanoparticles across health, energy, and technology sectors.  This research award supports public engagement with nanotechnology through hands-on educational demonstrations of nanoparticle applications, with a focus on promoting inclusion for groups historically underrepresented in manufacturing research such as women and minorities.<br/> <br/>Current challenges in thin-film coating of nanoparticles include particle aggregation, non-uniform coating, limited thickness control, and undesired sensitivity to particle size and morphology.  This research award meets these challenges by combining the monolayer-by-monolayer deposition principle of conventional atomic layer deposition with the hydrodynamic nanoparticle manipulation approach known as deterministic lateral displacement to achieve a new nanomanufacturing technology termed 'Liquid Phase Atomic Layer Deposition'.  This approach represents a shift from conventional atomic layer deposition based on deposition at the solid-vapor interface to a new deposition physics based on successive adsorption and deposition reactions at the solid-liquid interface.  The research studies center on utilizing specially positioned nanoposts within a microfluidic channel to passively transport suspended nanoparticles into discrete, adjacent flow streams of successive reactant and wash solutions.  It is hypothesized that the controlled solid-liquid interface phenomena of Liquid Phase Atomic Layer Deposition yields a high degree of precision and uniformity for nanoparticle thin-film coating. The engineering of parallel three-dimensional microfluidic reactors, constructed by means of two-photon direct laser writing-based additive manufacturing, ensures that this method is also high throughput.  The research team investigates the phenomenon of Liquid Phase Atomic Layer Deposition through fundamental experimental studies, computational fluid dynamics simulations, and multiphysics finite element modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some help plants by providing nutrients, whereas others can have negative effects like causing disease.  Ecologists now believe that some microbes in the soil can determine which plant species can grow in a particular place and how common those plants can become.  Thus, microbes may be an invisible force determining the health of many plants, including those we depend on for food.  Practically all microbes are sensitive to changes in the environment.  This is important because changes in weather -- decreased rainfall, for example -- could greatly affect which microbes thrive in the soil and therefore the abundance and distribution of plants.  Plants, in turn, may determine the presence or absence of certain microbes in the soil, thereby creating a complicated situation in which plants and microbes affect each other's success.  This idea of ""plant-soil feedback"" is a relatively new way of thinking about what plants need and their living arrangements with microbes.  This research will test how sensitive soil microbes are to soil moisture and, in turn, how that sensitivity may impact plants.  The investigator will compare plant and microbial communities along a gradient of rainfall in Texas and will explore how native and non-native plant species differ in their interactions with microbes along that gradient.  Results of this work will have direct applications for predicting and mitigating the effects of drought on an economically and culturally important ecosystem, Texas grasslands. This research will also provide training opportunities for the next generation of scientists, including students from underrepresented groups at the University of Houston, a Hispanic Serving Institution. The investigator will share her experiences with children in under-served public schools and will lead educational workshops through local non-profit agencies.<br/><br/>This project has three major components. First, a greenhouse experiment will test how water availability influences plant-soil feedback among native and non-native plant species. The experiment will be paired with root microscopy and DNA sequencing to identify candidate microbial taxa underlying plant-soil feedback effects, a critical, but often lacking step in generalizing plant-soil feedback responses. Second, a precipitation-manipulation experiment in the field will test, for the first time, whether changes in plant-soil feedback can predict changes in plant community composition in the different precipitation treatments. Third, a reciprocal soil transplant experiment will test for generality in plant-soil feedback responses across a natural precipitation gradient in Texas, which will provide insights into whether plant-soil feedback responses to climate may depend on historical climate legacies. Given plant-soil feedback theory's success at integrating plant-microbe interactions into the framework of plant community ecology, deeper insights into the factors that influence plant-soil feedback may transform our understanding of how plant communities are structured and plant diversity is maintained.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These new tools will improve on existing models because they will be both more realistic and more computationally tractable.

A cell's fate -- differentiation into a specific biological cell type -- is determined by several interlinked factors: cell-intrinsic mechanisms, signals from the local environment outside the cell, and messages the cell receives from other cells. Despite unprecedented amounts of experimental data at single-cell resolution, how cell fate is determined remains not fully understood. Challenges to development of a theory arise from information crosstalk at multiple temporal and spatial scales, as well as from the need to mine, integrate, and model the new single-cell ""big data"" derived from experimental measurements.  To address these challenges and to establish a founding paradigm for multiscale cell fate research, a team of mathematical scientists and biologists will develop novel mathematical, computational, and statistical tools to analyze cell fate through a multiscale lens. The Center will carry out a coherent program for community building, interdisciplinary training and workforce development, and diversity enhancement to expand the mathematics-biology interface and to promote the convergence of mathematical and biological sciences. The Center will produce cohorts of interconnected young researchers and will nationally seed the next generation's laboratories. The knowledge gained will create new multiscale mathematics for analyzing big data and modeling complex systems, with broader applications to regenerative medicine, embryonic development, and birth defects.<br/><br/>The NSF-Simons Center for Multiscale Cell Fate Research will establish new understanding of mechanisms and principles of cell fate control through investigation of emerging behavior of cells across scales. The study aims for transformative insight into cell fate, with a focus on three biological themes: cellular complexity and plasticity in skin, stochastic dynamics and migration of neural crest cells, and epigenetic control of stem cell specification. While each theme addresses different gaps in understanding of cell fate, they all emphasize emergent complexity arising from multiscale interactions, and they share several mathematical aspects. The Center aims to develop new mathematical methods driven by these specific cell-fate questions as well as broader biological applications. Data-driven and principle-based multiscale models of cell fate will guide experiments, with subsequent feedback to the modeling efforts.

Roughly speaking, a dynamical system is a rule which predicts the motions of a point in a geometric space; examples of mathematical models of dynamical systems include the study of fluid dynamics, airflow dynamics, billiard trajectories, etc.  As a concrete example, consider a polygonal billiard table, e.g., an L-shaped billiard table; and to simplify the situation, let us assume that the table has no friction and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.  Behavior of billiard trajectories have long been fascinating to mathematicians and physicists--note that different trajectories can have different behaviors, e.g., some trajectories are periodic and some trajectories are dense (they make a visit near every point in the table). For instance, one can ask whether a billiard table has any periodic trajectories, or more quantitatively, one can ask how many periodic trajectories of a certain length exist?  Surprisingly, questions of this kind have proven to be notoriously difficult to answer and are connected to several areas of modern mathematics. It turns out that even to understand billiard trajectories on one single table one is led to the study of families of billiard tables which have same combinatorics, e.g., same number of edges for the table. These families turn out to have new symmetries and enjoy certain rigidity properties which help to unravel the original problem. This project studies questions with similar philosophical point of view.<br/><br/>The project seeks extensions and extensions of certain rigidity results where a rather weak initial data about an object yields an almost complete classification of the object; the goal is to provide a more quantitative account of these rigidity results with applications in mind. The following will be the main objectives: (i) Dynamical systems have become a major player in several unexpected areas in modern mathematics. Proofs relying on dynamical arguments, however, are usually existential and not constructive. For various applications, quantitative and effective accounts of dynamical arguments are much sought after and challenging. (ii) Discrete subgroups of Lie groups with finite covolume are central objects in mathematics and have been extensively studied.  In some natural settings -- e.g., Kleinian groups, several monodromy groups, Apollonian circle packings, and Zaremba's conjecture -- however, one needs to consider Zariski dense, discrete subgroups (and semigroups) of semisimple Lie groups with infinite covolume.  These investigations often lead to the study of group actions on infinite volume spaces.  (iii) The moduli space of a compact Riemann surface is one of the hubs of modern mathematics. Despite the very inhomogeneous nature of the moduli space, there are several similarities between this space and homogeneous spaces. Dynamics on moduli spaces presents a very exciting avenue for research with many outstanding and challenging problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The majority of these failures result in partial or total collapse and occur during the service life of the building under sustained gravity loads. The formation of local damage and the evolution from local failure to global collapse are often not immediate; instead, they are complex time-dependent phenomena, for which little knowledge exists. The fundamental knowledge obtained from this project will facilitate better interpretation of early warning signs of building collapse for more prudent evacuation, rescue, and stabilization decisions; advance prediction and evaluation of a damaged building safety; and ultimately inform design for safer and more robust buildings able to resist collapse. These outcomes will reduce the economic and societal impact of building failure. The project will partner with the engineering community for immediate dissemination of the research, engage under-represented groups, and increase public scientific engagement, and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The impact of sustained loads on collapse evolution of two common types of reinforced concrete buildings, moment frames and flat-plates, will be studied by experimental simulations and numerical modeling. The project will identify and model the response of structural components sensitive to time-dependent concrete damage under sustained high stresses, examine and model the response of substructures under sustained high stresses caused by an initial local failure, identify system level response and the interaction among most impacted components, and evaluate collapse risk. At the material scale, the research generates knowledge for confinement effects on concrete creep at sustained high stresses; at the component scale, the research will generate knowledge of the effects of creep and shear crack opening on the sustained loading response of columns, axially restrained beams in frames, and slab-column connections; at the system scale, the research will lead to a crucial understanding the performance and collapse risk of frame and flat-plate systems under high sustained loads and the collapse evolution mechanism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Many aspects of modern technology, spanning the range from computer chips to batteries, rely on moving charge, either electrons or ions, across the length of solids. Precisely controlling the flow of ions and electrons is of great importance for these technologies, and it depends on the pathways defined by the structural arrangement of atoms within the material as well the manner in which the atoms are bonded together. The project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, explores the way in which rearranging atoms and changing pathways within a versatile class of compounds (built from atoms of vanadium, oxygen, and a variable third metal) alters the flow of electrons and ions. By adjusting the distance between atoms and the width of the conduits, the researchers can make a material insulating, metallic, or bring it to a point where it can be switched between insulating and metallic behavior when applying external stimuli. Such materials are of great interest for designing new ways to process information. Alternately, tuning conduits for storage and movement of ions holds promise for enabling the design of new types of batteries.  As such, the project advances national prosperity and welfare by unravelling basic mechanisms and guiding the design of new materials for electronics and energy storage. Understanding the specific manner in which atoms need to be connected to realize effective paths for charge flow paves the way to creating new precisely designed compounds exhibiting unprecedented function in terms of tunable electrical conductance and the ability to store ions. In order to further the objective of US global leadership in education, the principal investigator engages a diverse group of students in his research through summer internship programs and workshops, with an emphasis on students transferring from community colleges. <br/>??<br/>PART 2:?? TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>?<br/>As electrons and holes propagate across extended solids, the velocity, energy, and effective mass of the charge carriers are determined by the specific pathways that they traverse. The ability to precisely and continuously tune orbital overlap and modulate bandwidths through specific alterations of atomistic structure is a long-desired goal in the chemistry and physics of solids, but it is exceedingly difficult to achieve in practice given difficulties in independently controlling structure and composition. The project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, seeks to precisely define electronic and ionic conduction pathways using a versatile palette of compounds with the formula MxV2O5 (where M denotes a cation and x its stoichiometry) by alteration of composition, framework connectivity, and cation stoichiometry. The project comprises two thrusts: the first thrust is focused on developing design rules for tuning electronic conductivity based on modulation of structure, composition, and stoichiometry with an emphasis on designing new materials that are at the cusp of undergoing electronic transitions. The second thrust is focused on designing intercalation hosts for Li-, Mg-, Ca-, and Al-ions based on a systematic understanding of specific structural motifs that allow for diffusion of each of the cations. Both thrusts bring together theory, synthesis, characterization of average and local structure, measurements of electronic structure, and the search for descriptors to design new electron correlated materials and multivalent insertion cathodes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researchers at the University of New Orleans study transition metal and oxygen-free compounds with covalent anionic networks as candidates for cathodes with RAA. This project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, provides new and important fundamental insights into possible redox active anions cathodes through experimental proof-of-concept of RAA cathodes with extended covalent anionic networks. The strong covalent boron-boron bonds in the selected borides preserve a covalent boron framework during electrochemical cycling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate high energy density and ionic conductivity for the Mg-ion cathode material studied. The research focuses on syntheses, structural and electrochemical properties investigations of several borides, which are potential Na-ion, and Mg-ion cathodes. Utilization of soft chemistry approaches extends the accessible compositions to new compounds. DFT determination of average voltages and volume changes on cation deintercalation as well as activation energies of the cation diffusion and ionic conductivities are performed.

Studying the subsurface structures of the Anatolian Plate will provide a snapshot about how continental collision and subduction modify the lithosphere and its underlying asthenosphere. In addition, the interactions among these tectonic plates make Turkey one of the most seismically active regions in the world. There are several large fault zones, including the 1500 km North Anatolian Fault, which have generated large magnitude earthquakes and serious damage to the local community. In this project, the PI proposes to map seismic structures of the Anatolian Plate, which enable the investigators to test several scientific hypotheses, such as the behaviors of the North Anatolian Fault Zone and the magma chamber of volcanic fields. With the new seismic model, the team will simulate ground motions associated with a number of large magnitude earthquakes that may occur in Turkey. These predictions will provide valuable information for seismic hazard evaluation and mitigation, which will have significant social and economic impacts. This project will advance the development of a new geophysics group at UT Dallas by supporting an early career PI and one Ph.D. graduate student. Results from this project will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, presentations at national meetings, as well as an online tomographic model visualization platform.<br/><br/>With the support of this project, the PI's team will develop a new tomographic model for the Anatolian Plate, which includes 3-D variations in seismic velocities, azimuthal anisotropy and shear attenuation. Full waveform inversion, an advanced imaging technology which takes complicated wave physics into account, will be used to better extract quantitative information for the Earth's materials. By jointly interpreting velocities and azimuthal anisotropy, the team will test the following the following questions: (1) Is the North Anatolian Fault Zone a lithospheric or crustal scale transform fault? (2) Are there lower crust channel flows underneath the Anatolian Plate? (3) How do the mantle flows respond to the westward extrusion and counterclockwise rotation of the Anatolian Plate?  Furthermore, considering different sensitivities of attenuation and velocity to the physical states of the crustal and mantle materials, joint interpretation of these results will help to better delineate the morphology of magma chambers, and detect potential partial melt underneath the Central and Eastern Anatolian Volcanic Fields.

Representing the role of icebergs in global climate models (GCMs) poses a formidable challenge to the scientific community. The most striking shortcoming of current iceberg models is arguably that they do not represent giant tabular icebergs, even though giant icebergs carry most of the freshwater stored in icebergs in the Southern Ocean. This lack of large icebergs in models is mostly due to the difficulties associated with adequately modeling iceberg decay. In particular, fracturing and breakup are not typically considered in iceberg models, despite being dominant iceberg decay processes. <br/><br/>Investigators are to address these issues using a hierarchy of iceberg models, ranging from an idealized analytical model to a comprehensive GCM, in concert with recent observational data. The main objective of this study is to develop a new iceberg model that:<br/>(i) accounts for iceberg breakup and fracturing processes that have been neglected to date,<br/>(ii) improves on the representation of iceberg decay processes that were considered in previous models,<br/>(iii) explicitly represents large tabular icebergs.<br/><br/>The primary broader impact of the proposed work will be through a K-12 teacher workshop series showcasing this project as an example of how scientists develop physical models.

Social scientists increasingly recognize that displacement is often long-term. Therefore, policy makers must pursue alternatives to temporary refugee camps. But to do this effectively, policy makers need more information about how displaced populations affect the economic and social conditions of the regions where they settle. Long-distance migrations to Europe have garnered recent headlines, but refugees more typically flee to nearby countries, often to regions where they or their kin have previous social relationships. As governments negotiate the distribution of responsibility for hosting these displaced populations, finding sustainable and security-appropriate solutions to today's worldwide migration crisis has become a matter of concern everywhere, including in the United States.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted by City University of New York Graduate Center anthropology doctoral candidate, China Sajadian, advised by Dr. Mandana Limbert. Sajadian will undertake 12 months of research in Lebanon because Lebanon hosts the highest number of refugees per capita in the world. Over one-quarter of Lebanon's population is comprised of displaced Syrians, which makes the effects of forced migration there appropriately visible for targeted data collection and analysis. Sajadian will collect data with two primary methods. To document everyday labor practices and the specific effects of refugee settlement, she will conduct ethnographic research, including observation and interviews, among a stratified sample of 250 farmworkers in villages adjacent to the Syrian-Lebanese border. She also will pursue archival research about the history of land tenure, labor, and migration in the region. Findings from this research will inform policy makers about how loss of cross-border mobility for seasonal farmworkers reconfigures social and economic relations in the country of settlement. Knowledge of these processes will help policy makers develop approaches for dealing with refugees that are attentive to the specific predicaments, livelihood needs, and security challenges of borderland regions.

Vanadium dioxide (VO2), as one of the representatives, is of particular interest because of its phase transition could occur close to room temperature. The project seeks to tune the phase transition properties (e.g., phase transition temperature) through a novel two-phase nanocomposite design approach. By combining VO2 with a metal as a secondary metal phase in the nanocomposite thin films, the phase transition properties are tuned in a wide range. Such tunable transition properties are critical for various applications, including thermal actuators, electrical switching devices and smart windows. In addition to scientific and technological impacts, this research provides training to graduate and undergraduate students in the multidisciplinary research area of phase change materials, thin film growth and materials characterizations. The research findings are disseminated through in-class teaching modules related to phase change materials, summer research for undergraduates and high school students, and various outreach activities sponsored by Purdue Women in Engineering Program and Birck Nanoday events.<br/><br/>Technical Description:  The project focuses on a fundamental material exploration of novel two -phase metal-VO2 nanocomposite designs, their phase change properties and the fundamental switching mechanisms as functions of the metal selections and the nanoparticle dimensions, density and geometries. As one of the Mott insulating oxide materials, VO2 exhibits an ultrafast and reversible phase transition from a semiconductor phase to a metallic phase at about 68 ?C during heating process. To enable its practical applications, tunable transition properties (e.g., phase transition temperature tuning over a broad temperature range) are very much desired. Specifically, the project focuses on synthesizing the two-phase metal-VO2 nanocomposites in an epitaxial thin film form, tuning the transition temperature and phase transition properties via selection of metals, as well as understanding the fundamental phase transition mechanisms via tailoring the two-phase morphology, e.g., the metal phase geometry, density, dimension, etc. The phase change properties are measured by a set of electrical transport and optical measurements, coupled with a detailed microstructural characterization, including high resolution transmission electron microscopy, atomic scale elemental mapping and strain mapping.

Gradually, it was realized that these algebraic invariants (called cohomology theories) could themselves be represented by geometric objects, known as spectra. A central triumph of modern homotopy theory has been the construction of categories of ring spectra (representing objects for multiplicative cohomology theories) which are suitable for performing constructions directly analogous to those of classical algebra.  This move has turned out to be incredibly fruitful, both by providing invariants which shed new light on old questions as well as by raising new questions which have unexpected connections to other areas of mathematics and physics. The project funded by this grant carries out this program in the setting of a rich invariant called algebraic K-theory and related theories known as topological Hochschild, cyclic, and periodic homology.  The project studies applications of these theories to a broad range of questions in number theory, algebraic geometry, and geometric topology, as well as algebraic topology itself.<br/><br/>This research continues a broad research program aimed at applying recent work of the PIs on algebraic K-theory and trace methods to study a wide variety of basic problems in number theory, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and symplectic topology.  It also includes a project to develop the foundations of equivariant derived algebraic geometry, which has applications to organizing computational phenomena observed in the study of topological modular forms.  The PIs' recent work has resulted in a complete description of the homotopy groups of K(S) (in terms of other known spectra) and a canonical identification of the fiber of the cyclotomic trace via a spectral lift of Tate-Poitou duality.  The PIs have a program to apply this work to provide novel evidence for the Kummer-Vandiver conjecture. If successful, this would provide another example of input from algebraic topology addressing questions in number theory. The PIs previously applied their work on the fiber of the cyclotomic trace to resolve conjectures in the p-adic Langlands program about the (co)homology of stable congruence subgroups. The PIs describe a series of projects that would use homotopy theoretic data about the fiber in the study of the p-adic Langlands program.  Other recent work of the PIs established a Kunneth theorem for topological periodic cyclic homology (TP) of dualizable dg categories. This result has already had interesting applications in noncommutative algebraic geometry, as a consequence of regarding TP as a kind of noncommutative Weil cohomology theory. The grant includes a project to establish this viewpoint and to apply TP in noncommutative algebraic geometry. Based on conversations with Abouzaid and Kragh, the PIs have started exploring applications of algebraic K-theory and TP to symplectic topology via the wrapped Fukaya category.  The PIs describe a series of projects that leverage their expertise and prior results to study fundamental questions in this area.  PI Blumberg has previously worked with Mike Hill to develop the foundations of the theory of equivariant commutative ring spectra. PI Mandell is one of the foremost experts on topological Andre-Quillen homology (TAQ). In collaboration with Basterra, Hill, and Lawson, the PIs study equivariant TAQ as part of a broader program to develop the foundations for equivariant derived algebraic geometry.

Such defects may degrade semiconductor properties by trapping charge carriers to reduce the current and charge speed. These imperfections depend sensitively on the specific techniques used for growing and/or subsequent thermal, chemical, and plasma treatments. The research, which combines experimental studies with transport modeling, is aimed at measuring the optical properties of lattice structural and chemical imperfections of these relatively unexplored semiconductors, using growth variations, plasma, hydrogen annealing, and irradiation treatments to identify their physical nature and electrical measurements in magnetic fields to identify their ability to donate or accept electrons. The project ultimate goal is to understand the nature of these defects and eventually to eliminate them. The ability to remove these structural and/or chemical defects impacts a range of technologies. Zinc oxide is a prime candidate to replace today's high-cost materials in solar cells, digital displays, and light emitting diodes. Gallium oxide's ability to handle very high voltages can improve power switches for telecommunications and power transmission. Indium gallium oxide can provide higher speed displays and high-resolution TVs. Scandium nitride can lower resistance and power consumption of metallic contacts to semiconductors used in cellphones. The activities provide collaborative research opportunities for a graduate student, several university undergraduates, and high school students from an all-girl's high school.<br/><br/>Technical description: The research focuses on fundamental studies of native point defects in the semiconductors ZnO, Ga2O3, InGaZnO, and ScN, which have emerged as critical materials for advanced high power and optoelectronic display applications. ZnO, doped with Ga or Al, is the prime candidate to replace expensive indium tin oxide in solar cells, displays, light emitting diodes, and touchscreens. Ga2O3 is the dominant new material for power switches because of its record high breakdown voltage. InGaZnO is the dominant amorphous oxide replacing amorphous-Si transistors in displays and high-resolution TVs (e.g., Sharp). ScN can improve ohmic contacts in GaN-based devices and serve as a buffer layer for GaN-on-Si technology. All four can be highly doped with impurity donors, yet all four are impacted by deep level defects that compensate free carriers and introduce scattering that reduces carrier mobility. The nature of native point defects in Ga2O3, InGaZnO, and ScN as well as ZnO is almost completely unexplored, yet these defects can have a major impact on carrier density, mobility, and interface transport. The research team will measure the spatial distribution and physical nature of specific defects using 3-dimensional nanoscale optical spectroscopies coupled with donor /acceptor densities and dielectric properties by temperature-dependent Hall effect and reflectance/transmission measurements, respectively, in order to identify and quantify defect densities on a near-nm scale and understand how to control them through new growth and processing techniques. The goals of this work are to understand the primary compensating defects in these compounds that limit degenerate doping and produce lower mobilities, combining near-surface remote plasma, implantation and thermal processing with optical and surface science techniques to identify these native point defects, correlate them with donor/acceptor densities, and chemically control them. The project also aims to explore the impact of these defects on barriers and transport at Schottky barriers and heterojunctions involving these semiconductors. The overall goal of the project is to control these defects and their impact on carrier densities and junction transport by selected growth and processing techniques that improve conductivity and interface properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interestingly, the fundamental problem of understanding and classifying shapes of spaces is more difficult in these lower dimensions compared to higher dimensions. In fact, investigating some of the new phenomena that happen in these dimensions require the use of more modern invariants, or in other words, quantities associated to shapes that can distinguish between those with different properties. This subject is also closely related to knot theory, that is focused on studying the shapes of knotted circles in three-dimensional spaces.  Low dimensional topology and knot theory have various implications in physics (quantum theory), cosmology (the shape of the universe), chemistry (molecular knots) and biology (knotting of DNA and DNA-protein interactions). This project aims to study the shapes of three- and four-dimensional spaces and configurations of knotted circles and surfaces in them using an invariant defined by the PI and her collaborator.

For example, Eftekhary and the PI defined tangle Floer homology as a generalization of (minus) Heegaard Floer homology. In one direction, this project aims to (1) study embeddings of graphs and homology cobordism group of homology cylinders using tangle Floer homology and (2) introduce invariants for concordances and Seifert surfaces, and get bounds for unknotting number using cobordism maps for tangle Floer homology. In a different direction, the PI intends to (3) give a computationally effective way for detecting handlebodies using bordered Floer homology (different extension of Heegaard Floer invariants for 3-manifolds with boundary defined by Lipshitz-Ozsvath-Thurston) with the hope of providing a new way for detecting homotopically ribbon fibered knots.  This project also proposes to study the properties of an invariant for knots and links, called symplectic sl(n) homology. This invariant is conjecturally equal to sl(n) homology, and the PI plans to (4) investigate spectral sequences for specific involutions in symplectic sl(n) homology and establish a better understanding of this conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One area of investigation is energy-minimizing mappings between curved spaces (known as nonlinear harmonic maps) and their singular sets, i.e., points where the mapping ceases to be smooth. Another area of investigation is the structure of the spaces that arise as limits of smooth spaces with bounded curvature, and a third area is the regularity of solutions to the Yang-Mills equations which arise particle physics. The research project also touches on other mathematical subjects such as Reifenberg analysis, spectral analysis, stochastic analysis and metric-measure spaces. In each area, open problems which are at the forefront of the topic are being pursued. These are topics which have broad applications to many areas of mathematics and physics, and solutions to these problems would open doors to tackling the next generation of problems. Many parts of this project also involve the training of early-career researchers, as several lines of investigation involve collaboration with senior graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.<br/><br/>The first part of this overall project is concerned with the energy identity and the W2,1-conjecture for nonlinear harmonic maps. Roughly, the energy identity is a conjectural picture which gives an explicit formula for the blow-up behavior of sequences of nonlinear harmonic maps. The W2,1-conjecture is the easily stated conjecture that stationary harmonic maps have a priori L1 estimates for their hessians. Valtorta and the PI have solved these conjectures for stationary Yang-Mills, but the methods do not work for harmonic maps, and the PI will solve the problems by other means. In another line of investigation, joint with Yu Wang, the PI will answer some open questions by Hardt and Lin on nonlinear harmonic maps. Roughly, the goal is show one can solve for stable harmonic maps in the class of strongly H1-mappings. The second part of the proposal would address issues involving the regularity of spaces with lower and bounded Ricci curvature. Together with Wenshuai Jiang the first project of this part would study the energy identity for limits of manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature. Though similar in spirit, the problem itself is actually very different from the harmonic map case. To begin with, the energy in this context is the L2 curvature form, and it has only been very recently that one even knows this is a bounded measure. Secondly, the predicted form of the defect measure in this context can be computed by the singularity behavior in the limit. Additionally, with Bob Haslhofer, the PI will study connections between bounded Ricci curvature and the analysis on path space. The PI will prove differential Harnack estimates for martingales on spaces with two sided Ricci curvature bounds. The solution to each of these problems involve the development of new techniques and ideas, which themselves one would expect to be even more interesting than the problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We take a community-based approach to reduce cost, with active glacier scientists collecting samples gratis during their own field campaigns to contribute to this project. Our results will provide a geologic lens through which to view modern climate change, and offer a paleo-test for computer models used to simulate glacier responses to future warming -- important to freshwater resources in some areas and global sea level rise. <br/><br/><br/>We will reconstruct glacier histories by applying the in situ 14C-10Be chronometer to several samples of proglacial bedrock at each glacier terminus. This technique is able to determine what portion of the Holocene a glacier advanced beyond and retreated behind its current terminus by quantifying the buildup of both 14C and 10Be during periods of exposure and the preferential loss of 14C during episodes of ice cover due to its much shorter half-life. Our latitudinal transect is designed to maximize understanding of how glaciers responded to orbital variations, as well as how climate may have been coupled between the low and high latitudes and across the hemispheres. Given that Holocene glacier trends may have varied substantially with latitude, the broad scale of our reconstructions will also provide the context needed for evaluating current glacier retreat around the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because one electron reactions (radical reactions) are traditionally viewed as highly reactive and difficult to control, the goal of this research is to better understand fundamental properties of radical initiations to engineer mild and user-friendly experimental protocols.  Many structures that can be accessed via radical chemistry are found in drugs, vitamins, materials and polymers, and so new strategies for radical initiation may have a positive impact on many fields of science that directly benefit society.  The project involves monitoring radical reactions in real-time to understand chemical behavior.  The resulting reaction data is used to develop educational materials for undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory and lecture courses. In addition, through industrial partnerships, volumes of authentic reaction data is collected and refined to develop a repository of undergraduate/graduate educational materials that are made available to educators throughout the Nation.   <br/><br/>Arenes and heteroarenes are common structures with many desirable materials.  Strategies for their rapid diversification are in demand. Radical carbon-hydrogen functionalization offers the ability to directly modify aromatic carbon hydrogen bonds via either nucleophilic or electrophilic processes, although uncontrolled reactivity is common to intermolecular processes.  This project involves two discrete aims to study fundamental physical properties that affect rates of radical initiation for synthetically important reactions.  The first focuses on developing catalyst systems that use silver ion, as an oxidant, and exogenous pyridine ligands in a novel way to control the rates of radical initiation for intermolecular nucleophilic functionalization of heteroarenes. Catalyst redox properties are studied electrochemically, and this data is correlated with global reaction rates to inform the development of optimum catalyst/oxidant systems.  The second aim involves the iron-catalyzed reduction of nitrogen-oxygen bonds to promote intermolecular radical amination of arenes through an electrophilic process.  The electronic properties of various nitrogen-radical precursors are examined to develop efficient strategies that combine mild initiation with reliable rates of initiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

T cells that express different cell surface receptors (or ""clonotypes"") are produced by the thymus and allow an organism to respond to a broad spectrum of pathogens. How many different surface cell receptors and their total numbers present in the T cell pool are critical quantities that determine an organism's ability to neutralize pathogens. Results of the research have the potential to significantly improve understanding of how the immune repertoire evolves with infections and aging, how it can be more accurately measured, and how it is affected by procedures such as thymic transplantation.  As part of the research the investigators will also foster a series of educational activities involving Cal State-Northridge and UCLA students, including joint seminars, student presentations, and summer projects.<br/><br/>Two representations of counting clonotypes, clone-counts and cell-counts, will be further developed to better measure and quantify the adaptive immune system. Clone-counts describe the number of T cell clonotypes represented by a specific number of cells while cell-counts quantify the number of cells within each clonotype. Mathematical models for T cell populations and T cell diversity typically use one of these two representations and often rely on strong physiological assumptions.  The large number of clonotypes, the constant birth and death of each clonotype, the activation of certain clonotypes upon infection, and the slowing down of thymic output associated with disease and aging all render the quantification and prediction of T cell diversity challenging. By exploiting the mathematical connection between these two representations, the investigators will develop hybrid models of T and B cell components of the immune system applicable under a wider range of physiological conditions.  These hybrid models will be pivotal in extending current models to include important physiological processes such as clonotype proliferation, cellular maturation, and regulation. Finally, hybrid models, both deterministic and stochastic, will facilitate more accurate determination of an organism's immune diversity through small blood samples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The idea is that new and powerful computing tools will provide insight that was not available to earlier generations of mathematicians.  One such question, known as Thomson's problem, asks how some number of electrons will arrange themselves on the sphere so as to minimize their total potential energy.  Such a problem has wide-ranging applications because in many scientific fields it is quite useful to know how to evenly distribute points or sensors or energy sources in a space.  The principal investigator recently resolved a large part of the story for the case of five points on the sphere and plans to continue to develop this theory.  Another problem asks about the stability of the solar system in a highly simplified model of celestial mechanics called outer billiards.  It is known that there exist initial conditions for which the corresponding orbits are unbounded; this project aims to further develop a theory that provides detailed theoretical pictures of these orbits in a special case.  Another problem under investigation in the project is the famous square peg problem, which asks if every loop in the plane has four points on it that make the corners of a square.  <br/><br/>In technical terms, the project focuses on the following areas.  First, it is planned to extend results related to a phase-transition conjecture for the 5-electron problem.  The principal investigator proved that there exists a constant c such that the triangular bi-pyramid is the energy minimizer for the Riesz s-potential if and only if s is not greater than c.  It is conjectured that some pyramid with square base is the energy minimizer for the Riesz s-potential if and only if s is not less than c. Second, the project aims to continue developing the plaid mode, a combinatorial construction that assigns to each rational number a collection of polyhedral surfaces contained in a cube.  When the model is sliced in one coordinate direction, it gives loops which accurately model certain orbits of outer billiards with respect to the kite with the same parameter.  When the model is sliced in the other two coordinate directions it gives loops that are combinatorially isomorphic to those found in Truchet tilings and in corner percolation.  Third, the principal investigator plans to continue an ongoing study of the space of inscribed rectangles in a Jordan loop.  He has established that every Jordan loop has associated to it a connected set of rectangles such that every point of the loop, with at most 4 exceptional points, is the vertex of one of the rectangles in the set.  This result leads to a question of how a rectangle can slide continuously along a pair of arcs, a problem akin to studying the solutions of a differential equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to prove, in a mathematically rigorous way, that these systems on the long run behave as if they were random. Consequently, ideas from the theory of random processes can be applied to derive the emergence of statistical macroscopic order from microscopic disorder, that is when the system size or the time of observation is large and the initial state is typical. For the above-mentioned example, this approach provides a derivation of the heat equation from some microscopic deterministic models, which is a central question in the mathematical theory of statistical physics.<br/><br/>Specifically, three research projects will be studied.

The second project is about advanced statistical properties of hyperbolic systems in both finite and infinite measure case. For example, the local central limit theorem, as a very useful tool in many applications including project one, as well as its connections to infinite measure mixing will be studied for hyperbolic maps and flows.

Its ability to mix and disperse energy or mass (like chemicals or particles) plays a key role in every day applications, like flows in oil and gas pipelines, in industrial reactors, in mixing, in heating or cooling, as well as in the atmosphere and in oceans. The goal of this project is to understand the effects of flow features that are commonly observed in turbulent flow on the transport of energy and mass using advanced computational techniques. The findings of this research could lead to efficient energy management, efficient design of industrial equipment where heat and mass transfer take place, and better prediction and control of pollutant dispersion. The database generated through this project will become available to the scientific community, and simulation data generated through this project will be used to develop animations of turbulent dispersion that can be used in K-12 science demonstrations.<br/><br/>Central concerns for the development of a comprehensive turbulent transport theory have been the prediction of the spatial variation of turbulent viscosity, the effect of molecular dispersion on turbulent transport, and the effect of coherent velocity structures on the transport properties. The main hypothesis here is that the reason for the failure in predicting scalar transfer from momentum transfer is that only some of the velocity structures participate in turbulent transfer close to a wall, and the range of scales that participate in the transfer depends on molecular dispersion effects. Main questions to be answered are what is the role the very large scales of motion (known as VLSM) in turbulent transport, and how the interplay between molecular diffusion and convection affects mixing or separation of particles in anisotropic turbulence. The proposed approach is to use computations with Lagrangian methods for analysis, which afford the study of a range of fluids that span several orders of Prandtl number in magnitude (e.g., liquid metals, gases, refrigerants, and electrochemical fluids) making it possible to handle cases where conventional methods are often not feasible with the current supercomputers.

This detection process involves a new biosensor architecture called the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor consisting of an electrically conductive and very thin plastic film in which are embedded virus particles.  These virus particles are responsible for recognizing and binding to the proteins the authors are detecting.  The electrical resistance of this virus-plastic film is then monitored using two metal electrodes, and the resistance increases when the protein of interest is detected.  The goals for this project are to improve the performance of the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor, to broaden the range of molecules that can be detected, and to discover the detailed mechanism and principle of sensor operation.  It is also proposed to design a multi-channel sensor that provides the capability to simultaneously and rapidly measure ten different proteins.  In coordination with this research program, the investigators will operate a summer outreach program, called NEXTech 2018: Nano Electrochemistry eXtensions to Technology for high school students focusing on electrochemistry and applications to nanoscience.  Laboratory experiments that demonstrate key principles will also be carried out by these students under the supervision of the graduate students funded by this grant.  <br/><br/>    How can one design electrical interfaces that enable communication between nanoscopic biological structures and an electrical circuit? In this proposal, the authors seek to electrically detect the binding of protein molecules to virus particles as a means for detecting these proteins at concentrations down to 1 pM.  This is accomplished using an extremely simple sensor architecture called the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor that consists of a conductive PEDOT (or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) film that contains a high volume density of M13 virus particles engineered to recognize and bind a particular target protein.  As one example, the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor detect the protein human serum albumin (66 kDa) at a concentration of 10 nM and at higher concentrations up to 800 nM.  The response time of these sensors is in the 5 second range.  A major advantage of this sensor design compared with field-effect transistor-based protein sensors - is that its performance is not degraded by the presence of salt in the solution, even at high concentrations of 1M.  Even in this case, large amplitude, high precision electrical responses to the presence of these protein molecules are measured.  <br/>    The goals for this project are to further improve the performance of the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor, to broaden the range of molecules that can be detected, and to discover the detailed mechanism and principle of sensor operation.  It is also proposed to design multi-channel versions of the sensor that provide the capability of measuring ten different proteins in parallel, at the same time.  A deeper understanding of the mechanism by which the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor operates will be sought.  This component of the research will involve testing a series of hypotheses that isolate several candidate mechanisms.<br/>    In coordination with this research program, the authors will operate a summer outreach program, called NEXTech 2018: Nano Electrochemistry eXtensions to Technology for high school students focusing on electrochemistry and applications to nanoscience.

T cells that express different cell surface receptors (or ""clonotypes"") are produced by the thymus and allow an organism to respond to a broad spectrum of pathogens. How many different surface cell receptors and their total numbers present in the T cell pool are critical quantities that determine an organism's ability to neutralize pathogens. Results of the research have the potential to significantly improve understanding of how the immune repertoire evolves with infections and aging, how it can be more accurately measured, and how it is affected by procedures such as thymic transplantation.  As part of the research the investigators will also foster a series of educational activities involving Cal State-Northridge and UCLA students, including joint seminars, student presentations, and summer projects.<br/><br/>Two representations of counting clonotypes, clone-counts and cell-counts, will be further developed to better measure and quantify the adaptive immune system. Clone-counts describe the number of T cell clonotypes represented by a specific number of cells while cell-counts quantify the number of cells within each clonotype. Mathematical models for T cell populations and T cell diversity typically use one of these two representations and often rely on strong physiological assumptions.  The large number of clonotypes, the constant birth and death of each clonotype, the activation of certain clonotypes upon infection, and the slowing down of thymic output associated with disease and aging all render the quantification and prediction of T cell diversity challenging. By exploiting the mathematical connection between these two representations, the investigators will develop hybrid models of T and B cell components of the immune system applicable under a wider range of physiological conditions.  These hybrid models will be pivotal in extending current models to include important physiological processes such as clonotype proliferation, cellular maturation, and regulation. Finally, hybrid models, both deterministic and stochastic, will facilitate more accurate determination of an organism's immune diversity through small blood samples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Euclidean geometry, we study objects such as circles and rectangles. A circle is highly symmetric; for example, any rotation about the center of the circle preserves the circle. A rectangle, though still symmetric in some ways, has less symmetry than the circle; its two sides may have different lengths. In low-dimensional topology we study more complicated objects or spaces of two, three, and four dimensions. A central aim of this National Science Foundation funded project is to understand these spaces through symmetries. Topological objects arise naturally in other fields, including biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering.  At times, the best way to understand one is via its relationship with another through what is known as a ""covering map"". A second project is to analyze covering maps. A challenge in studying more intricate three or four dimensional spaces is that one cannot always visualize or draw these even using a computer. It is therefore helpful to break them into building blocks. One of the projects is to do so with objects called hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  In addition to the mathematical research, the PI has demonstrated a strong dedication to outreach, mentoring, and advocating for underrepresented individuals in the STEM disciplines. With the NSF travel funds she will continue to engage in opportunities inside and outside the academia directed at promoting mathematical research and education. <br/><br/><br/>The focus of this research project is to understand the finite degree covering spaces, the group of symmetries, and the combinatorics of hyperbolic manifolds in low dimensions.

When the ice sheet collapsed, those fresh lake waters were released to the Atlantic Ocean, and are thought to have disrupted ocean circulation, causing abrupt cold spells in the northern hemisphere, and perhaps globally.  Near southern Ontario and northern New York State, enormous Glacial Lake Iroquois contained massive amounts of cold fresh water, and modern remnants of that lake include Lake Ontario and Oneida Lake.  Oneida Lake is located near the easternmost part of ancient Glacial Lake Iroquois, and this area and the Mohawk Valley were a key valve for the release of meltwaters to the Hudson River and to the Atlantic.  The Oneida Lake project will study the ancient sediments laid down during these meltwater releases, to determine their precise timing, and will then compare those timings to past climate records derived from Greenland ice cores and from sediments from the Southern and the Atlantic Oceans.  The researchers will use geophysical (sonar) methods to image the sediments below the bottom of Oneida Lake, and then collect sediment cores for detailed analyses.  Special Carbon-14 dating techniques will be used to date sediments in the cores and to correlate the layered sediments to similar records previously collected in New England.  Project outreach efforts include a public lecture series for lake-side communities, engagements with Oneida Nation high school science classes, and the installation of science information kiosks at a State Park on the lake?s eastern edge.<br/><br/>This project is examining the Late Quaternary sediment record from the Oneida Basin in Upstate New York, through analyses of new geophysical data and new sediment cores. The unusually rich stratigraphic archive will constrain the paleoclimate evolution along the SE margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in the terminal Pleistocene. The researchers will also develop an energy balance hydrologic model of ancient Glacial Lake Iroquois to better constrain fill and discharge events from this basin. Non-linear episodes that perturb the global climate system (e.g., the Younger Dryas cooling) include major meltwater pulses and drainage pathway switches associated with Glacial Lake Iroquois and its precursors. The researchers will evaluate Termination I (the end of the last glaciation, ~20,000 years ago) at seasonal resolution over several millennia, using the rich varved sediment record in Oneida Lake and surrounding outcrops. Outcrop observations of newly discovered lake sediment exposures (varves) in the basin will be integrated with correlative sedimentary sequences recovered by cores from Oneida Lake. The glacial varve record will be chronologically constrained via paleomagnetic methods (cross-dating) with the North American Varve Chronology and further fixed by selective use of Ramped PyrOx radiocarbon dating of organic matter and separately of pollen 14C dating. Preliminary high-resolution seismic data reveal a remarkable, high-fidelity stratigraphy with evidence for outburst flood events, ice sheet instabilities, and a continuous time series from deglaciation through the Holocene. The full lake will be surveyed at high spatial resolution using CHIRP (sweep signal seismic) and multichannel seismic reflection methods. The calibrated time series of events will be compared to three well-established global archives: the Greenland ice core record, the Antarctic Peninsula Palmer Deep and Cariaco Basin marine sections. Beyond the direct scientific outcomes and graduate student training, the researchers will mount an outreach effort including: 1) a riparian community lecture series; 2) construction of two information kiosks describing the geologic evolution of Glacial Lake Iroquois and subsequent evolution of Oneida Lake at two lakeside parks; and 3) engage under-represented groups including secondary school students from the Oneida Nation during both field and laboratory activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The four color map theorem was first proved in 1976 by Appel and Haken; the proof involved a huge amount of case checking, so much so that the only feasible method of attack was via computer.  This machine-assisted proof, however, cannot be directly checked by a human.  Although there have been some subsequent simplifications and clarifications, the general brute-force approach has seemed to be the only line of attack.  The four color theorem can be rephrased, though, as a question about the topology of three-dimensional manifolds, and in particular new tools inspired by high energy physics give novel ways to approach a conceptual proof of the four color theorem.  This project explores and develops these new insights.<br/><br/>The principal investigator and collaborator define a version of instanton Floer homology for trivalent graphs embedded in three-manifolds.

They are developing new tools for the computation of these and related invariants, and they have discovered a spectral sequence relevant to this computation.

Since their development in the early part of the new century, optical combs have enabled remarkable advances in precision measurement of time and frequency, which are critical to position and inertial guidance, and in high-speed spectroscopy useful for applications such as environmental sensing and breath analysis. However, these combs are generated from specialized lasers, which are rather bulky, which still hinders their deployment for many real world applications. Furthermore, the pulses they emit are limited to relatively low repetition rates.  Substantially higher repetition rates are needed for other promising applications, such as optical communications, photonics-based radio-frequency signal processing, and calibration of certain astronomical instruments.  More recently, a new choice for generating optical frequency combs has emerged, based on the interaction of light with tiny ""microresonator"" structures on integrated photonic chips.  These microresonator-based comb generators are fundamentally very small, which offers new opportunities for low cost deployment, and provide much higher repetition rate, which offers compatibility with new applications.  Research at Purdue University will explore methods to overcome challenges in guiding the optical combs generated from microresonators into stable and repeatable low-noise states desirable for applications and will provide advanced training to students at the graduate and undergraduate level relevant to careers in high technology and science.<br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>Continuous-wave pumping of a high quality factor microresonator can give rise to formation of combs of optical frequencies spaced by tens to hundreds of GHz.  Such combs arise due to nonlinear wave mixing mediated by the optical Kerr effect and are frequently termed Kerr combs.  In a particularly interesting state, the comb comprises cavity solitons (more formally called dissipative Kerr solitons), ultrashort pulses of light that propagate in the microresonator with remarkable stability, thanks to a double balance between loss and parametric gain and between dispersion and nonlinearity.  However, controlling the nonlinear dynamics to achieve the desired stable states of operation is complex.  One complication is that the comb evolves through a chaotic regime before it potentially switches into a stable cavity soliton state; the passage through chaos leads to strong indeterminacy in the state generated.  Competition with thermo-optic nonlinearities that are exacerbated by power transients that occur upon transition into the soliton state cause further challenges.  Although progress has been made, control strategies to deal with these issues are particularly challenging for desirable chip-scale microresonator devices.  This project proposes to explore two new approaches to guiding the evolution of the comb to desired states, including single soliton states, within the rich, nonlinear dynamical phase space.  One approach investigates the idea of a so-called chaos-avoiding trajectory involving coordinated manipulation of pump laser power and frequency to reach stable soliton states without passing through the chaotic operating regime usually encountered.  A second complementary approach will explore a recently proposed passive scheme toward obtaining single solitons based on mode interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is interdisciplinary by design - the problems cut across the fields of materials science and fluid dynamics - and is motivated by both practical and futuristic engineering applications. In materials science, for instance, there is the potential for new biologically-inspired and growth-based design mechanisms for building highly flexible but controlled solid membranes. Regarding fluid dynamics, besides the potential for the design of new and extremely efficient heat exchangers, the investigation is motivated by the broader scientific challenge of deriving the scaling laws of naturally occurring transport in turbulent fluids. As experience shows, these questions are very difficult to solve on a computer by applying conventional numerical techniques. There are oftentimes many nearly optimal answers, and each can be rather complex. Rigorous mathematical analysis presents the possibility of knowing that certain patterns are truly optimal overall: such information cannot be gleaned using other non-rigorous approaches. Thus, the project is an important contribution to the larger scientific community interested in understanding why or how such complex patterns achieve global optimality.  <br/>  <br/>This project consists of two main parts: (a) The first class of problems concerns the mechanics of thin elastic sheets, such as naturally occurring ones like leaves and flowers, but also man-made versions which can be orders of magnitude thinner than a standard sheet of paper. The thinner an elastic sheet becomes the more easily it can be deformed, in particular through bending forces, but extracting from such intuitive physical principles the mathematical mechanisms behind the vast array of wrinkling, folding, and crumpling patterns found in experiments is a clear and difficult challenge. The investigator seeks to derive through rigorous mathematical analysis the effective, coarse-grained models governing optimal elastic patterns in the vanishing thickness limit. A key task is to obtain the scaling law of the minimum energy in any natural parameters, and then to ask which patterns can possibly attain such energy scaling laws. (b) The second class of problems regards the design of incompressible fluid flows for achieving optimal heat transfer. While hot objects submerged in fluid media do cool on their own, it is natural to ask whether the efficiency of heat transfer can be significantly enhanced by intelligent stirring of the surrounding fluid. Oftentimes, any stirring protocol achieves some enhancement of heat transfer, but determining which strategies attain maximal heat transfer overall is an intriguing and open question. In the advection-dominated limit, which can be reached by increasing the amount of power available with which to stir, such optimal strategies exhibit patterns remarkably similar to those from problems of ""energy-driven pattern formation"" in mathematical materials science. The investigator is developing a precise and general link between these apparently related classes of problems, and is exploring its ramifications for the study of the scaling laws of naturally occurring turbulent transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the several phenomena that may be responsible for this failure is so-called ""sensitivity to imperfections,"" or the highly oscillatory nature of energy minimizers resulting in non-compactness even in very simple geometries like cylinders. The imperfection sensitivity phenomenon poses an ongoing challenge to engineers working with a wide range of thin-shelled structures, from aircraft and automotive components, buildings, poles, and other civil infrastructures, to carbon nanotubes and biopolymer shells. One of the goals of this project is to use the general theory of buckling of thin structures to quantify the imperfection sensitivity phenomenon. Another goal is to solve the longstanding problem of determining the rigidity of a given shell, which is believed to be identified by the principal curvatures of the shell. <br/><br/>While the problem of determining the rigidity of plates is well understood, determining the rigidity of a given shell has been a longstanding problem in continuum mechanics. Recent results on shells in the linear elasticity setting, with vector fields satisfying Robin boundary conditions on the thin face of the shell, provide evidence that the rigidity of a shell is determined solely by the principal curvatures of the shell's mid-surface. One of the goals of the project is to extend ansatz-free lower bounds to the nonlinear geometric rigidity setting. The strategy is to use existing estimates inducing artificial boundary conditions by test functions as well as a universal Korn interpolation inequality, which reduces the linear geometric rigidity estimate to a Poincar? type estimate. Once this is done, a new hierarchy of shell theories with smaller gaps will naturally follow, which will encompass the existing ones derived by Gamma-convergence. The second part of the project is to further develop the theory of buckling of thin structures. The theory has two ingredients: (i) proving sharp Korn's inequalities, and (ii) proving the existence of bending-free trivial branches.

Time-inconsistency is a phenomenon in which the preferences of a decision maker change over time, due to various factors. Careful studies show that there are two main reasons for this: the decision makers' time preferences and their risk preferences. The former is due to the fact that decision makers may place more weight on the immediate utility, while the latter is due to the decision makers' different subjective opinions in estimating the risks associated to their decisions at various times. This project studies general time-inconsistent problems quantitatively, from the point of view of stochastic optimal control theory, with the goal of obtaining time-consistent equilibrium solutions to these problems. The results obtained should lead to a better understanding of the time-inconsistency issue and provide some guidance towards making time-consistent decisions that are acceptable in practical situations. The expectation is that the theories developed in this project will be applicable to asset pricing, risk management, resource allocation, and production planning. Graduate students will be trained as part of the project.  <br/><br/>In time-inconsistency problems, time preferences can be described mathematically by discounting, which may be exponential or non-exponential, while risk preferences can be described by the choice of expectation operators, such as the classical expectation or various nonlinear versions of it. Classical stochastic optimal control problems of continuous-time dynamical systems involve exponential discounting and classical expectations. In this case, Bellman's principle of optimality holds, which leads to time-consistency of optimal controls, that is, an optimal control found for a given initial pair of time and state will remain optimal afterwards. However, when a stochastic optimal control problem involves either a non-exponential discounting, or a non-classical expectation operator, the problem becomes time-inconsistent, namely, an optimal control selected at a given time based on the given initial state does not remain optimal at a later time. This project aims to develop general tools for finding time-consistent equilibrium strategies (rather than time-inconsistent optimal controls) for time-inconsistent stochastic optimal control problems. The specific problems to be investigated involve cost functionals depending on initial pair and conditional expectations, recursive cost functionals, as well as problems with distorted probability. It is expected that this project will provide a better understanding of the time-inconsistency of optimal control problems and that the theory developed will significantly contribute to the area of mathematical optimal control. Further, the project will have a significant impact in applications and in other areas of mathematics, such as stochastic analysis, mathematical finance, differential games, and partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These features can change a material's response to mechanical deformation and can lead to increased strength. Depending on temperature, the amount of gas, and time, these gas bubbles can arrange themselves into an ordered structure, which is oftentimes called a gas-bubble 'superlattice'. Deformation of the material, can change the arrangement of this gas-bubble superlattice, which, in turn, can change the mechanical-property response of the material. In this work, we will focus on helium (He) bubbles, which are common in materials exposed to nuclear environments. We will use a helium-ion-beam microscope with subsequent small-scale mechanical-property evaluation techniques, such as indentation and nano-pillar compression testing. Different materials which represent different structures will be investigated which will allow us to understand the changes these structures undergo while being deformed and its implications for the mechanical performance of a material. The images and results of this research will be used as an outreach tool in classes and in presentations, to engage local high-school students in materials research. Furthermore, we will actively engage undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented minority groups, in this research effort, thereby training them on relevant materials-science techniques and tools and preparing them early for graduate school.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>This program aims to obtain a fundamental understanding of self-assembled, nanoscale, He-bubble superlattices in representative metallic materials of different crystal structures under external load and subsequent deformation. The goal is to observe how this regular arrangement of gas bubbles reacts to the deformation, perhaps even to the point of losing the regular arrangement of the bubbles. To make these observations systematically, we will utilize a He-ion-beam microscope in a novel way: namely, not to photograph images but to implant the beam's He into the material.  By controlling the implantation, we can quantify with increased experimental accuracy the mechanical-property changes associated with these structures, which will allow us to refine the material-hardening models with direct parameter input from these experiments. Expanding the experimental text matrix to different crystal structures (FCC, BCC, HCP) will lead to a more fundamental understanding of the formation of these structures while also generalizing the effect of these structures on mechanical properties. Additionally, the development of this new implantation technique not only will accelerate research on gas bubbles in materials but may also impact other scientific fields investigating the optical and quantum properties of semiconductors as well as nano-foamed materials. The funding will provide the resources needed to do the research and will allow the nuclear-materials group at UC Berkeley to intensify our outreach efforts both within and outside the academic community, to trigger the general public's interest in materials and nanoscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The equations of motion in classical mechanics are determined by the notion of a conserved quantity, energy.  A related quantity is action, which is minimized by solutions to the equations of motion.  For a closed system, such as the Kepler problem whose solutions describe paths of planets orbiting the sun,  the energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy in the system, and the action is given by the (minimized) mean value of kinetic minus potential energy.  Symplectic and contact structures emerge as we investigate these systems by unpacking the information hidden in the notions of energy and action.  Understanding the evolution and distinguishing transformations of these systems led to the development of global invariants of symplectic and contact manifolds.  <br/><br/>The PI plans to continue her work in providing foundations and applications for contact invariants stemming from nonequivariant and (circle) equivariant constructions of contact homology. Contact homology is built out of closed orbits of Reeb vector fields and counts of solutions to a nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equation which interpolates between closed Reeb orbits. Reeb vector fields are Hamiltonian-like vector fields, whose flow lines are solutions to Hamilton's equations of motion, as they conserve energy. Closed Reeb orbits are of particular interest because they can be used to describe the motion of a planet orbiting a star, the closed trajectories of a satellite, and other local distance minimizing ""loops."" Contact homology can be used to better distinguish contact structures on a given smooth manifold and to extract dynamical information pertaining to the possible Reeb vector fields which can be associated to a fixed contact structure. The PI's work has shown that these invariants capture more phenomena than previously expected. She also plans to study additional structural properties of these contact and related symplectic invariants, Legendrian knots in closed contact manifolds, dynamics of Seifert fiber spaces, and symplectic embeddings.

These diverse applications are united because they all involve the motion of small molecules (such as oxygen). Because the molecules are so small, they move by an inherently random process called diffusion. While theoretical work on diffusion dates back to Einstein and others, the biology driving this project requires significant extensions to the classical theory. In particular, this research will construct a mathematical framework to calculate statistics of diffusion inside a randomly changing environment, and the theoretical results and predictions will be compared to empirical measurements. In addition, this project will train new mathematical biologists since graduate students will be closely involved in the research. Additionally this research and its biological applications will enrich pair of new courses that the PI is developing: a graduate course on applied random processes and a course on probability and statistics for secondary math teachers.<br/><br/>In addition to being widely applicable in biology, diffusion in a random environment is a rich mathematical topic. It has two complementary descriptions, either a randomly switching partial differential equation (PDE) or a randomly switching stochastic differential equation (SDE). In either case, the process combines two layers of randomness interacting across spatial scales: Brownian motion at the particle level and a random environment. Analyzing these processes will require combining tools from disparate areas of mathematics to develop new mathematical machinery. In particular, the dual PDE/SDE representation will allow for the combination of PDE methods and probabilistic tools and elucidate new connections between these fields. Furthermore, the mathematical results will provide the tools needed to model a broad collection of biological systems. These models will in turn (i) transform the understanding of a ubiquitous class of biochemical reactions, (ii) uncover basic properties of an essential neural communication mechanism, and (iii) answer a longstanding and fundamental question in insect physiology.

Printing of colloidal nanoparticles into functional materials and devices provides an economically viable way towards manufacturing nano-scale structures and components for diverse applications such as sensing, energy harvesting, solid-state lighting, and information displays. Such a technological capability advances national prosperity and security. Printing techniques such as gravure printing and inkjet printing have advantages in eliminating tedious mask alignment and multi-step processes required in conventional lithography for device fabrication. However, existing printing techniques have low resolution, considerable post-processing time, and special requirements on the properties of colloidal solutions. Bubble printing exploits optically controlled bubbles to enable versatile patterning of colloidal particles on most substrates. This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of bubble printing into a viable technology for both prototyping and scalable manufacturing of functional materials and devices. The research is at the interfaces of photonics, fluidics, colloidal science, and manufacturing sciences, provides interdisciplinary research opportunities for students and helps broaden participation of women and underrepresented minority students in manufacturing and engineering. The incorporation of the research results into outreach programs helps promote public interest in nanotechnology and scientific advancement. <br/><br/>Bubble printing employs a laser beam to generate a microbubble at the interface of colloidal suspension and a substrate via opto-thermal effects. The bubble captures and immobilizes the colloidal nanoparticles on the substrate through coordinated actions of Marangoni convection, surface tension, gas pressure, and substrate adhesion. Bubble printing can overcome the limitations of existing printing techniques such as poor resolution and feature fidelity. However, some scientific barriers need to be overcome to realize the full potential of bubble printing for scalable fabrication of functional materials and devices from colloidal particles. This research is to fill the knowledge gap on the mechanisms of bubble generation and printing. The research approach is to perform experiments supported by simulations to advance the fundamental understanding of bubble dynamics and nanoparticle assembly, and elucidate the novel physical mechanism for rapid transport, capture and targeted immobilization of colloidal particles at the generation of multiple microbubbles. The project develops a system for scalable printing of functional materials and devices with high resolution, throughput, stability and reproducibility, and demonstrate the capability of bubble printing for site-specific fabrication and integration of multiple functional devices on single platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent research shows that the popularity of cultural artifacts, such as books, music, and movies, may be contingent on initial opinions.  These are often arbitrary and unpredictable, yet subsequently can drive huge opinion cascades. A similar dynamic may explain the divisions that emerge between political partisans or demographic groups (e.g. young and old, men and women). That is, when an initial group of visible partisans disagree, subsequent opinion generators from each side may take this a cue to how they should act, furthering the divide between the groups in a cascading fashion. Findings will serve the national welfare by shedding light on arbitrary social processes that may amplify societal discord and so offering the possibility of ameliorating their effects.<br/><br/>The hypothesis of this project is that division between groups can be driven by a dynamic similar to that found by Salganik, Dodds, and Watts (2006) in their investigation of the fickleness of cultural success.  They created an experimental music download site, with multiple worlds in which users could only see the downloads of those in their same experimental world.  Findings were that the opinions converged more in the worlds where users could see the activity of others around them.  To test the hypothesis of this project, a website will be created where experiment participants will be asked to register their political and demographic affiliations. They then will be divided into different experimental worlds, including one independent world (a control). In all worlds, users will vote on various issues. In experimental conditions, users will be able to see the opinions for all in-group and out-group members in their world. By contrast, those in the control condition will vote without seeing other people's opinions. The prediction to be tested is that initial opinion differences between groups will be arbitrary, such that the direction of the association between opinions and groups will vary between worlds, but that the group influence will amplify these differences, leading variations to be stronger than expected by chance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The former is the language in which many physical theories are formulated, while the latter studies the shapes of three- and four-dimensional spaces. It is common to apply knowledge of geometry to predict the behavior of physical systems. For example, it is straightforward to predict the sound of a drum from its shape. The opposite approach is sometimes also feasible; in particular, the study of differential equations originating from gauge theories can lead to very deep insights about the topology of spaces. In recent ground-breaking work, Ciprian Manolescu disproved the almost hundred-year-old Triangulation conjecture, which roughly asserted that in higher dimensions, every space can be cut into very simple pieces. The main goal of this project is to use the PI's recently developed computational techniques to understand in greater detail several properties of the object studied by Manolescu, called the three-dimensional homology cobordism group.<br/><br/>This project has two main goals.

The Pin(2)-symmetry is reflected in an extremely rich A-infinity structure on these invariants, and we will focus on understanding the higher operations and their implications for natural topological operations such as connected sums. Second, to apply these tools to study problems in low-dimensional topology, focusing particularly on the homology cobordism group in dimension three.

Currently, few complete Water Conservation Technician programs exist in the United States. Lane Community College's (LCC) Water Advanced Technological Education Resource for Individuals (WATER-I) Program aims to address this need for a Water Conservation Technician workforce.  The program will be designed to increase access to Water Conservation Technician education for more diverse community-college populations. The WATER-I model will use a blended-learning delivery method to expand Water Conservation Technician education to students across the western US, with the potential to expand across the nation. Students will take LCC's coursework online and complete their course fieldwork with an LCC-trained utility mentor at their local utility. Regional utilities and utility professional associations have agreed to provide employee-mentors for this project.<br/><br/>WATER-I leverages an on-line content delivery approach to reach a broader range of students than currently served by LCC's Water Conservation Technician program. WATER-I expands online curriculum to students in rural areas and to other nontraditional students. The program is motivated by 1) the high demand for a Water Conservation Technician workforce by industry and consumers; 2) the need for an education method to reach broader student populations, and 3) LCC's expertise in both Water Conservation Technician programs and in delivering quality programs outside traditional classroom settings. To widen WATER-I's geographic focus, WATER-I staff will transfer the didactic elements into an online environment and develop fieldwork experiences through regional water utilities; these fieldwork experiences are similar to internships or cooperative education. With this model of higher education/ industry partnership, students can receive Water Conservation Technicians training, regardless of geography or other limitations to participating in a solely face-to-face program.

Such a dynamic broadband optical router, if realized, would enable the far-field steering of beams, enabling new optical system functionalities such as signal multiplexing and routing. Today, the closest state-of-the-art solutions to the proposed system are ones based on MEMS micro-mirrors and liquid crystal spatial light modulators. In comparison to these known systems, the proposed device would be revolutionary in terms of switching speed, compactness, and versatile reconfigurability with the benefit of no moving parts. The physical and design principles, large-area manufacturing technologies, and software developed in this program will prove invaluable for future developments of the proposed dynamic achromatic optical router. All co-investigators will supervise undergraduate students, including individuals belonging to under-represented groups in sciences and engineering, building on their extensive track record in this important area. Co-PIs will employ a unified plan of action to incorporate nanophotonics into curricula, including classes in nanophotonics and openly accessible lecture notes. Furthermore, co-PIs will organize and establish a summer experience workshop for K-12 students in their respective community e.g. in Science Museums and Science Fair, an activity that will be closely coordinated with the institution and reported to NSF annually. They will also organize summer school, with emphasis on minority and under-represented participants. <br/><br/>Conventional approaches to the design of metasurfaces rely on subwavelength, near-resonance, metallic or dielectric scatterers as building blocks. The major drawback of such an approach is that the shaping of the wavefront can only be engineered for a frequency, since the scattered phase for each resonator depends on frequency in a highly nonlinear fashion. Indeed, the implementation of metasurfaces that function achromatically across a broad range of frequencies remains a formidable challenge. In conjunction, the electrical tunability of such anomalous reflection would represent a truly revolutionary device concept which can potentially employed in a variety of optical systems in a disruptive manner. Here, co-PIs propose novel strategies to do just that. The anomalous reflections required to achieve this tuning are induced by a phase gradient along a sub-wavelength-scale nanostructured metasurface mediated by gap plasmons within ITO based nanogap structures. Electrical tuning is achieved through ITO materials, which modifies the phase velocity of the gap plasmons and exhibits true time delay which allows for electro-optic control. This program will design the above-mentioned one-dimensional dynamic achromatic optical router, fabricate the device, evaluate its performance and fundamental limits, and perform scatterometry measurement to corroborate with theory. The device will be realized with a unique high-throughput nanomanufacturing method, atomic layer lithography that allows us to realize ultrahigh-aspect-ratio metal trenches needed for this work. If realized, the proposed device constitutes an electrically controllable plasmonic optical router that can be employed in a variety of optical systems, specifically where achromatic control of the light path on a pixel-by-pixel basis is essential, and cannot otherwise be achieved with current state-of-the-art.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These goals will be realized over the course of 3 years, starting with a Synthesis Workshop in Year 1 where working groups will be established, followed by working group meetings and formation of a Genomics Subcommittee in Year 2, and ending with an Integration and Training Workshop aimed at early career scientists in Year 3. To promote synthesis and self-organization at workshops, the workshops will employ the Open Space format.  ECS-RCN will promote evolutionary thinking in biological oceanography and integrate unique aspects of marine life-histories into evolutionary principles. ECS-RCN will also advance knowledge in both marine and evolutionary biology through synthesis and the development of frameworks for merging genomics and ecology. The activities will provide novel insights into pressing questions in both marine and evolutionary ecology, such as: what drives geographic patterns of local (mal)adaptation and plasticity?; what are the mechanisms that generate adaptive vs. nonadaptive plasticity?; what is the role of genotype dependent dispersal in adaptation?; what are the genetic constraints on adaptation of function-valued traits to climate change?; and how do epigenetic modifications act as a mediator between adaptation and plasticity? Ultimately, the RCN aims to develop a quantitative understanding of the relative importance of ecological versus evolutionary responses to climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Substitutional doping of graphene with heteroatoms (atoms from chemical elements different from the host material atoms) is one of the most fascinating strategies for tuning graphene's properties and hence expanding its applications. This project investigates the synthesis of heteroatom-doped graphene and related lateral junctions using heteroatom-containing source materials, which is a novel synthesis approach and enhances the capabilities for controlling the doping. This research also provides an atomic-scale understanding of the structural and electronic properties, as well as their interrelations. The realization of controlled synthesis of heteroatom-doped graphene and atomic-scale insights into their properties promote the development of graphene-based devices for electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. This project strengthens the materials science research at California State University Northridge, which is a minority serving institution, and provides collaborative research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, K-12 students from local schools receive exposure to cutting-edge research activities and advanced scientific facilities via summer activities.<br/><br/>Technical Description: Precisely controlling the doping properties is pivotal toward practical applications of graphene. Doping properties strongly depend on synthesis approaches, heteroatom sources, and synthesis parameters. It is an urgent task to explore new synthesis approaches and new heteroatom sources in order to achieve enhanced control over the doping strategies. In addition, two-dimensional graphene p-n heterojunctions are the key components for graphene-based electronics, which further motivates the development of bottom-up growth approaches for these heterojunctions. The objectives of this research are to develop optimized synthesis strategies for heteroatom-doped graphene and related lateral heterojunctions from heteroatom-containing sole precursors, which is a novel and effective synthesis approach, as well as to gain atomic-scale insights into the correlations between doping alternatives and electronic properties. To accomplish these goals, the main research activities include: (1) optimize the synthesis by employing a series of precursor/metal systems under varied synthesis conditions and identify the dependence of structural and doping properties (concentration, spatial distribution, and configuration) on precursors, substrates, and synthesis parameters; (2) explore electronic properties (band structure, charge carrier density, work function) by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements; (3) improve the synthesis of graphene lateral p-n heterojunctions using sole precursors, and characterize the atomic structure and band alignments at the interfaces of lateral heterojunctions by using STM measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particularly, where the atoms are arranged in the pattern of hexagons, called hexagonal close packed metals and alloys such as magnesium or titanium-based alloys, twinning (two separate crystals having the same structure in a symmetrical manner) is an important type of plastic deformation, which critically influences the mechanical behaviors such as ductility, strength, work hardening, and fracture. As such, twinning has to be understood and controlled for designing and processing the hexagonal close packed metals and alloys. However, this has been impeded by the elusive understanding of atomic scaled mechanisms of twinning processes in the metals. Despite tremendous research efforts, for decades, how atom movements influence the mechanism of twinning remains poorly understood. The proposed research will employ high resolution transmission electron microscopy to investigate atomic-scale twinning processes in the materials, providing in-depth understanding on the role of atom movement in twinning of complex crystal structures. The project will provide important guidance for twinning-based alloy design and processing for achieving superior mechanical properties. Thereby, it will advance the application of light metal-based structures. The program will integrate research and education through training graduate/undergraduate students with diverse demographic backgrounds (particularly, female and minority) and their participation in national laboratories as well as outreach to elementary school through Pittsburgh Carnegie Science Museum.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Twinning plays a crucial role in mechanical behaviors of crystals. Particularly, in hexagonal close packed (HCP) metals and alloys, twinning, in addition to dislocation slip, can be profusely activated and critically influences their ductility, strength, work hardening, texture formation and fracture, primarily because twinning can carry deformation along the <c> axis of the HCP crystal where dislocation plasticity is limited. As such, twinning has to be controlled for designing and processing HCP alloys with improved mechanical properties. However, this has been impeded by the elusive understanding of atomic scaled mechanisms of twinning nucleation and growth in HCP crystals. In twinning, a part of the parent lattice is reoriented and the product lattice is mirrored by the parent about the twinning plane. Classically, such a lattice reorientation is achieved by a homogeneous simple shear which carries all or a fraction of the lattice points to the twin. The shear is mediated by coordinated movement of twinning dislocations on the twinning plane. The classical description of deformation twinning has been validated extensively in cubic structures. A significant difference in twinning of double-lattice structures, such as HCP, is that a twinning shear cannot carry all the parent lattice points to the twin positions. As a result, additional atomic movements, called shuffles, are required to accomplish twinning. Despite tremendous research efforts, for decades, how atom shuffles influence the mechanism of twinning remains poorly understood. Atomically-resolved direct experimental investigation are necessary for exploring the actual atomic shuffle and shear during twinning nucleation and growth, and hence obtaining a fundamental understanding on twinning mechanisms in HCP crystals. The proposed research will employ state-of-the-art in situ high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to investigate atomic-scale twinning processes in HCP crystals, such as twinning nucleation, growth and pertinent transformations as well as the orientation-dependent competition between dislocation plasticity and twinning at atomic resolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such noncommutative phenomena turn out to appear naturally not only in mathematics and physics but also everywhere in life. For example, clicking button A before B in a game may produce a completely different outcome from clicking B before A. Noncommutative geometry is an emerging branch of mathematics to study the geometry of ""noncommutative spaces"", where the functions, like the position and momentum, do not commute with each other. This project will explore various interesting noncommutative spaces motivated by problems in operator theory, singular spaces, and mathematical physics. <br/><br/>The principal investigator proposes to investigate several projects in noncommutative geometry. In the first project, the principal  investigator will take ideas from different branches of mathematics including algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and differential topology to investigate the Arveson-Douglas conjecture. An analytic generalization of the Grothendieck Riemann Roch theorem for (singular) analytic varieties will be developed to identify the K-homology class associated to the essentially normal Hilbert module in the Arveson-Douglas conjecture. A secondary invariant theory in noncommutative geometry will be introduced to understand the Hilbert modules associated to Brieskorn varieties.

The minimum input energy, known as the band gap, is either direct or indirect depending on the specific crystalline structure. Silicon, which is essential for the vast majority of modern electronics and solar energy devices, possesses an indirect band gap meaning that light absorption and emission are feeble processes. In contrast, direct band gap materials are effective absorbers and emitters of light. Recent theoretical calculations indicate energetic feasibility for numerous forms of crystalline silicon with direct band gaps, but experimental synthesis pathways are not available. This research team aims to create entirely new forms of crystalline silicon that possess direct band gaps in order to improve optoelectronic properties that impact a range of technologies including solid-state detectors, optical communication and energy conversion devices. Research is focused on novel synthetic pathways that combine high- and low-pressure experiments in order to achieve access to kinetically-stabilized states. More generally, the development of novel synthesis methodologies broadly affects metastable materials beyond silicon. This research project occurs within an educational environment that emphasizes the career development of students and postdoctoral scholars.  <br/><br/>Technical description: This project utilizes a new approach for metastable materials synthesis through a combined high-pressure / ambient-pressure hybrid method. Numerous metastable silicon allotropes with enhanced optoelectronic properties are predicted to exist within 30 kJ/mol of the ground state, but effective synthesis pathways are lacking. By initiating ambient-pressure chemical synthesis from precursors formed under high-pressure conditions, entirely new synthesis pathways are possible due to the high-energy state of the recovered precursor that is metastable at ambient conditions. This effort explores the depth of realizable materials in silicon and probes the relationships between metastable allotropes and optoelectronic properties in order to create entirely new metastable crystalline allotropes that possess direct or quasidirect band gaps. The research contributes to the longstanding limitations associated with the indirect band gap of the cubic diamond structure. Experiments are conducted at high-pressure conditions in order to optimize single-crystalline growth and at low-pressure conditions to optimize precursor transformations. The intrinsic optical and electronic transport properties of novel silicon allotropes are established experimentally, and the library of potential high-pressure precursor materials is supported by calculations including density functional theory-based structure searching. The overall goal of the project is to produce and characterize new silicon phases exhibiting improved optical activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the 1980s and 1990s, the area of mathematics known as Representation Theory had applications to this goal in dimension three.  In the late 1990s the program of categorification, which encompasses various areas of mathematics, was introduced to tackle this question in dimension four. This National Science Foundation funded collaborative project aims to further this already deep connection between the two fundamental fields of mathematics. <br/><br/>Soon after quantum groups were introduced in the 1980s, certain knot invariants, such as the Jones polynomial, were constructed from these objects.  Specializing the parameter of a quantum group to a root of unity led to invariants of three-dimensional manifolds.  Categorification is an interdisciplinary area of research which seeks to ""upgrade"" certain structures in mathematics such as replacing numbers with vector spaces and vector spaces with categories.  A link homology discovered in the 1990s categorified the Jones polynomial.  This led a surge in research in categorifying various aspects of quantum groups and their representations at a generic value of the quantum parameter.  In order to categorify three-manifold invariants coming from quantum groups, one must try to understand categorified quantum groups at a root of unity.  The subject of hopfological algebra was outlined in the early 2000s to accomplish this goal.  Quantum groups at roots of unity are associative algebras defined over rings of cyclotomic polynomials.  Such rings are categorified by stable categories of modules over truncated polynomial algebras.  The investigators will look for module categories over these stable categories in order to try to categorify the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity including knot and three-manifold invariants.  In order to categorify the associated 3-dimensional TQFT, one must work over a slightly larger ring where certain integers are inverted.  This ring has been categorified recently and the investigators will attempt to incorporate this structure into categorical representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to derive theoretical properties of random fields and use these results to create efficient statistical tools to extract important and useful information from spatial data. This is done by focusing on specific features of random fields such as peaks, which serve as local representatives of the signal in their immediate vicinity. Thus, local signals can be discovered by detecting peaks whose height is above what would be expected by chance.

These compounds are unique, as transparency and conductivity are generally mutually exclusive properties of compounds. Indeed, optical transparency (as in window glass) is generally associated with electrical insulation, whereas electrical conductivity (such as in copper or gold) is generally associated with optically opaque metals. Known transparent conductors such as indium oxide doped with Sn are made by instilling conductivity in transparent insulators. The research team aims to develop a novel family of transparent conductors - metallic ceramics - by designing transparency in metals. This presents a new method to design optical properties as distinct from electronic properties. The approach has an exciting intellectual impact as it suggests a general approach for inverse design - starting from science-based design principles used as 'filters' for computational material selection, followed by identification of representative examples and then laboratory validation. The graduate students and postdocs of CU Boulder and Northwestern Universities are given exciting opportunities to participate in this cutting edge research effort.<br/><br/>Technical description: Transparent conducting oxides are paradoxical materials that form the basis of modern day technologies, such as touch screens, flat panel displays, solar panels, etc. The current method of choice for discovering new transparent conductors have relied on heavily doping transparent insulators until they become conducting. Unfortunately, wide band gap materials are intrinsically resistant to doping of charges because of the existence of so-called 'doping bottlenecks'. Namely, the introduction of a high concentration of free carriers into insulators generally leads to the spontaneous formation of structural defects with polarity that compensate that of the intentional doping. Consequently, the progress in finding and optimizing such technologically critical transparent conducting oxide materials has been frustratingly slow. The research team proposes an opposite, and likely more fruitful alternative of designing transparency in metals by looking for compounds that obey a set of 'design principles' with specific band structures. The design rules for such intrinsic transparent conductors are: (i) identify a compound with metallic band structure; such that (ii) it has low plasma frequency and (iii) low inter-band optical absorption across the Fermi level, and (iv) apply synthesis and characterization to the 'best of class' compounds, here Ba-Nb-O. The most visible advantage of metallic transparent conductors is that their conductivity comes from their high, indigenous carrier concentration. The complex theory-experimental approach in the proposal enables more efficient progress as alternative to the previously used trial-and-error method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gradually, it was realized that these algebraic invariants (called cohomology theories) could themselves be represented by geometric objects, known as spectra. A central triumph of modern homotopy theory has been the construction of categories of ring spectra (representing objects for multiplicative cohomology theories) which are suitable for performing constructions directly analogous to those of classical algebra.  This move has turned out to be incredibly fruitful, both by providing invariants which shed new light on old questions as well as by raising new questions which have unexpected connections to other areas of mathematics and physics. The project funded by this grant carries out this program in the setting of a rich invariant called algebraic K-theory and related theories known as topological Hochschild, cyclic, and periodic homology.  The project studies applications of these theories to a broad range of questions in number theory, algebraic geometry, and geometric topology, as well as algebraic topology itself.<br/><br/>This research continues a broad research program aimed at applying recent work of the PIs on algebraic K-theory and trace methods to study a wide variety of basic problems in number theory, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and symplectic topology. It also includes a project to develop the foundations of equivariant derived algebraic geometry, which has applications to organizing computational phenomena observed in the study of topological modular forms.  The PIs' recent work has resulted in a complete description of the homotopy groups of K(S) (in terms of other known spectra) and a canonical identification of the fiber of the cyclotomic trace via a spectral lift of Tate-Poitou duality.  The PIs have a program to apply this work to provide novel evidence for the Kummer-Vandiver conjecture. If successful, this would provide another example of input from algebraic topology addressing questions in number theory. The PIs previously applied their work on the fiber of the cyclotomic trace to resolve conjectures in the p-adic Langlands program about the (co)homology of stable congruence subgroups. The PIs describe a series of projects that would use homotopy theoretic data about the fiber in the study of the p-adic Langlands program.  Other recent work of the PIs established a Kunneth theorem for topological periodic cyclic homology (TP) of dualizable dg categories. This result has already had interesting applications in noncommutative algebraic geometry, as a consequence of regarding TP as a kind of noncommutative Weil cohomology theory. The grant includes a project to establish this viewpoint and to apply TP in noncommutative algebraic geometry. Based on conversations with Abouzaid and Kragh, the PIs have started exploring applications of algebraic K-theory and TP to symplectic topology via the wrapped Fukaya category.  The PIs describe a series of projects that leverage their expertise and prior results to study fundamental questions in this area.

Even milder head impacts require patient monitoring, though for how long is not completely known.  To care for people with less obvious injuries and to measure whether a patient has healed, new approaches to brain imaging are needed.  This research is targeted at improving the prediction and monitoring of brain injuries.  A loss of white matter is one of the changes in brain tissue after injury. How the head impact is distributed as stress in the brain is not known, nor do we know the tolerance of brain cells to stress. This research project will use fast confocal microscopy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques to develop and validate a multiscale mechanical model for brain white matter that can predict cell injury.  This validated model will be used to estimate axonal injury in the brain using impact models of the whole brain.  The research will be used in the education of undergraduate and graduate students.  The PI instituted the GirlsConnect club in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering to increase the participation and retention of women in this field.<br/><br/>This project will focus on identifying the injury thresholds for individual axons within white matter when the tissue is exposed to dynamic, mechanical stretch. This interdisciplinary research builds on the innovative experimental approaches to understand axon kinematics and novel multi-scale computational models of the collaborative team to introduce: (i) Analysis of axon-level displacements and sub-failure axonal damage following clinically-relevant, dynamic loading of white matter; (ii) Computational incorporation of the composite mechanics of axon and glial matrix interaction, including damage, into the global (macro) response of the white matter following tissue-scale loading; (iii) Quantitative prediction of stress concentrations at the axon-level from the computational models; and (iv) Integration of clinical imaging (MRI and Magnetic Resonance Elastography) and subsequent histopathology and correlation of mechanical properties to axonal damage. The multi-scale model will enable the prediction of changes in bulk mechanical properties from damage to the axonal microstructure and from myelin degeneration.

Fuel cells utilizing liquid fuels pose benefits in energy density, safety, and ease of fuel transport and storage.   DMFCs, in particular, are attractive because of ready availability of methanol, and the potential for producing methanol from renewable resources.  However, the low energy conversion efficiency of current DMFC technology has curtailed widespread use.  This work will provide detailed understanding of the catalytic reactions that occur in a DMFC, such that more efficient catalyst materials and structures may be proposed. The methods developed should advance direct methanol fuel cell technology along the path toward broader commercial application, thereby enabling cleaner and more efficient energy production.<br/><br/>The project will enable a new method for operando counting of active catalytic sites via the first demonstration of liquid-phase electrochemical steady-state isotope-transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA).  The method development will utilize - as a probe system - the electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) over carbon-supported platinum (Pt) and platinum-ruthenium (PtRu).  On these materials, the MOR involves several well-known intermediates, and it yields products that are amenable to characterization by both SSITKA and auxiliary techniques that can corroborate SSITKA data.  Complementary analyses, including in-situ infrared spectroscopy and numerous X-ray and electron-based materials characterization techniques, will be used to inform a holistic examination of the reaction mechanism. New understanding will be generated along several lines of inquiry as captured in two themes. Theme I will focus on experimental kinetics, and will link SSITKA data - obtained across a range of experimental conditions, catalyst particle sizes, and catalyst compositions - to microkinetic models that relate current-voltage characteristics to possible elementary steps. Theme II will utilize a broad range of ex-situ and in-situ characterization methods to identify and control active sites as a function of catalyst composition and synthesis methods. Taken together, the two themes should generate unprecedented insight regarding the factors that control activity and selectivity of catalytic electrochemical methanol oxidation, while also providing a platform for development and refinement of the SSITKA technique.  From a technological point of view, the fundamental understanding enabled by the SSITKA technique with respect to kinetics, detailed reaction mechanisms, and catalyst structure-function relationships will be translatable to a broad range of electrochemical reactions. In combination with other techniques, it will provide insight regarding active materials and surface structures that will guide the design of better-performing catalysts.

Recent advances in 3D imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) have made it possible to capture 3D root structures in natural growing environments and monitor their growth over time. Unfortunately, the potential of the imaging techniques has been largely held back by the lack of effective computational tools for interpreting the images and distilling biological insights.

In this context, however, the relationships among magmatism, lithospheric thinning and crustal extension are poorly constrained. The PIs will evaluate the role of lithospheric drip magmatism as a trigger for successful continental rifting by studying alkaline mafic lavas from the Bufumbira and Toro Ankole volcanic fields in western Uganda. A growing body of evidence suggests that density instabilities in the lowermost lithosphere can undergo abrupt localized destabilization in response to regional thermal or mechanical stress. This physical thinning of the lithosphere, occurring on a scale of 20-50 km, enhances both magmatism and the likelihood of extensional failure, i.e., successful continental rifting, and thus controls the ultimate shape of continental margins. The work couples detailed geochemical analysis of proposed drip-related lavas and their accompanying mantle xenoliths with geophysical modeling of lithospheric drip and the ensuing crustal extension. The implications of this work to the understanding of continental extension represent a new approach to predicting the locus of new ocean basins and the forces required to produce them. At a regional scale, this work is of high importance to nations along the East African Rift: drip magmatism does not sustain the shallow long-lived magma chambers that are necessary for viable geothermal energy production. In terms of human resources, this project supports female researchers from a wide range of educational institutions as well as graduate and undergraduate students in geochemistry and geodynamics, and brings a short-course in geophysics to geology undergraduates who seek careers in this field. <br/><br/>The lithospheric mantle is foundational - literally and conceptually - to the construction, destruction and division of tectonic plates. Modification of the lithospheric mantle by magma and fluids affects its composition and, by extension, buoyancy. If the bottom of the lithosphere is made denser, the base of the lithosphere can detach and sink, leading to small-volume basaltic volcanism, lithospheric thinning, and potentially rifting. Geochemical data on lavas suggest lithospheric drips drive volcanism in several parts of the East African Rift. Also, xenoliths from this area show significant metasomatism by melts and fluids, and lithospheric removal has been invoked to explain the timing and rates of recent uplift. In order to test this hypothesis, the role of lithospheric drips will be evaluated by: 1) obtaining detailed petrographic and mineral-scale compositional data on lavas and pyroxenite xenoliths, 2) calculating the physical conditions recorded by lavas and xenoliths, and 3) applying those calculations to 2D and 3D geodynamic models to whether lithospheric drip tectonics and melting explain the rocks themselves. Lithospheric drip melting is somewhat paradoxical, because cold descending lithosphere should not melt unless it is heated through conduction more rapidly than it becomes compressed during descent. It may be that additional complexity to symmetrical dripping is required, such as edge-driven convection during rifting or a nearby upwelling plume. This project will promote collaboration between 3 U.S. universities, including an REU institution, and provide opportunity for researchers from Uganda.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Einstein's theory of general relativity describes how the spacetime is curved by gravitation. The language of his theory is geometry and the phenomenon is governed by his eponymous equation. There have been great advances in both theoretical and experimental aspects of general relativity, for example the recent detection of gravitational waves by LIGO. However, due to the complexity of Einstein's equation, most of our knowledge of the universe are global and large scale, such as the observation of an astrophysical event from a very faraway distance. Recently, the PI and his collaborators applied the tools of geometry and differential equations to give the most precise measurement of gravitational energy and mass on any finitely extended region of the universe. This is essential in understanding the fine and local structure of our universe, with applications in, for example, GPS technology and space exploration. It is also crucial in studying non-isolated large-scale phenomena such as black hole mergers and collisions. The success of this project will deepen our understanding of gravitational energy/mass and the nonlinear local/global nature of the spacetime. The PI also plans to study geometric flows, which are differential equations that model how a geometric shape deforms and evolves to an optimal form in the most efficient way. The PI has been engaging himself in educating a diversified body of graduate students and young researchers, and the project will be instrumental for his continued efforts along this direction.<br/><br/>The PI plans to resolve several outstanding problems in general relativity and geometric flows by the method of geometric analysis.

Immediate goals include proving the general invariant mass conjecture, establishing a positive mass theorem for the Robinson-Trautman spacetime and the linear stability of higher dimensional Schwarzschild spacetimes, and the solution of a conjecture of Arnol'd by the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. This research project will also advance our understanding of nonlinear partial differential systems such as the optimal isometric embedding equation, the mean curvature flow, and the Einstein equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When a human observer is asked to detect a colored target that is barely visible (near threshold), her/his visual system adds color signals across space to achieve maximum sensitivity. But when one views a scene that contains highly colored objects at normal levels of visibility (suprathreshold), the visual system seems to subtract color signals. In this project, we will investigate how those two mechanisms (addition and subtraction) combine in the human visual cortex to produce perception. The project has important implications for all perceptual research. Our results indicate that perception at threshold can be very different from suprathreshold perception. The project's results will explain how these differences relate to color perception. These results will have  potential applications across a wide range of areas including communication and industrial design.<br/><br/>In our experiments, we will measure the spatial pattern dependence of color perception in humans over a range of cone contrasts from color threshold to highly saturated color, using the technique of hue and saturation scaling. In parallel, we will make measurements of the dependence on spatial stimulus variables of the human cVEP (color-Visual Evoked Potential, an EEG measure of color responses in early visual cortex) recorded with a dense array of electrodes on the scalp. The cVEP experiments have already proven that there are two cortical mechanisms that are the basis of color perception near threshold and suprathreshold: single-opponent and double-opponent neuron populations. The experiments in the continuation project are aimed at studying interactions between the two mechanisms and how interactions affect perceived color.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of the instructions for life, cells first duplicate their genetic material (DNA) and then move one copy to each daughter cell.  Cells perform this task millions of times each day. The machine utilized for cell division is called the mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is required to organize and arrange the chromosomal DNA and segregate it into the daughter cells. This process is extremely important for the formation, development and maintenance of all living organisms. The self-organization of the mitotic spindle cannot be understood using biology alone. Rather, it requires the understanding of the underlying physical principles that govern the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle. The research conducted here will apply physical concepts behind self-organization of liquid crystals (the same liquid crystals found in computer and cell phone screens) to understand the ability of the mitotic spindle to organize itself in the absence of outside instructions. Understanding the fundamental rules of life that underlie cellular organization will result in new knowledge about how cells work as well as new insights to help us understand and ultimately fight diseases.  The project will involve outreach to 8th and 9th grade girls in the nearby community, along with interdisciplinary training of undergraduates and graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The scientific objective of this proposal is to understand how microtubule turnover and crosslinking control the organization and dynamics of the mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is a high-density organization of cross-linked microtubules which should be enough to stall the inherent microtubule dynamic instability as well as the mobility of the filaments within the structure. Yet, it has been shown that the spindle undergoes overall flux from the chromosomes toward the poles. This flux has been noted to be faster at the chromosomes than at the poles. A new model put forth by the investigators proposes that the flux is an essential process to fluidize the spindle near chromosomes where enhanced motion is needed to error correction. Flux decreases at the poles because of increased adhesion due to higher levels of crosslinkers put there by the process of flux. This exciting new model creates a new physical framework to begin exploring the underlying fundamental principles that enable the dynamic self-organization of the mitotic spindle. The proposed work will directly test the hypothesized model using quantitative light microscopy and genetic manipulations. These tests will reveal new information on the inner workings of the spindle. The proposal directly responds to several important aspects of modern biological research including integrating across scales, from single molecules to complex structures and whole cells. The active matter experiments directly address the synthesis of life-like systems using minimal purified components. From a physics perspective, the synthesis of life-like systems are essential to understanding the non-equilibrium processes of biology that couple to self-organize, sense, and respond to stimuli. This is a frontier area of physics and materials research, which will uncover new knowledge about fundamental cell biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Generalized Plane Wave functions, introduced by the PI during her PhD, have already been proven to lead to be efficient tools for simple problems. Analyzing the corresponding methods will be a central focus of our work, with application to noise reduction in turboreactors.  The proposed work is expected to enable noticeable improvements in the numerical methods used to study acoustic effects in an air flow around a turboreactor. As recently reported by the Washington Post, airplanes have a huge impact on noise pollution. Taking into account noise reduction in the design of future aircrafts is very challenging, and will impact public health and policy.<br/><br/>Although GPW-based schemes represent a very promising numerical tool, little is known analytically about their performance. Sharper and more detailed estimates are necessary, however, to increase their impact on the community. This proposal focuses on the numerical simulation of wave propagation problems in inhomogeneous media, modeled by variable coefficients, in two and three dimensions. The principal application targeted is wave propagation in aeroacoustics in collaboration with Airbus SAS, where the source of inhomogeneity is the non-uniform flow, but the methods considered in this project will also apply to other variable material properties such as permittivity or sound speed. Novel mathematical and computational challenges need to be addressed in order to avoid the numerical error introduced a priori by a piece-wise constant approximation of the coefficients. Trefftz methods rely, in broad terms, on the idea of approximating solutions to PDEs using basis functions which are exact solutions, making explicit use of information about the ambient medium. This project is concerned with the design, mathematical analysis and computer implementation of numerical methods adapted to variable coefficients via Generalized Plane Wave (GPW) basis functions. The following research directions are proposed: (1) construction of GPWs for the convected Helmholtz equation, (2) h-version of convergence analysis, corresponding to refining the mesh, (3) p-version of convergence analysis, corresponding to increasing the number of basis functions with a fixed mesh, (4) implementation of a prototype GPW-Trefftz code for performance comparison with other methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the widespread use of plastics has led to intense problems with respect to disposal as many millions of tons of used plastics that occupy landfills, roadsides, as well as open and confined waters.  In order to keep the beneficial aspects of plastic materials it is therefore critical to explore materials that are renewable, i.e. both sourced from nature and biodegradable.  Polyhydroxybutyrates (PHBs) fill this need since they are synthesized by microbes and also biodegrade to form carbon dioxide and water on relevant  timescales.  However, the switch from petroleum-based plastics to materials like PHBs requires that the new biodegradable plastics possess similar mechanical and electrical properties compared to the petroleum-based plastics.  Properties such as strength, stretch, and stiffness must be at least equivalent to current commodity plastics.  It has been discovered in previous work that the ultimate mechanical properties of PHB can be changed by how the PHB is processed.  Mechanical strength can be increased by stretching or compressing the material rapidly during the formation process, resulting in a plastic that is still biodegradable but has the desired properties.  If the processing is fast enough, then new properties can be generated in PHB plastics, such as improved mechanical properties, as well as piezoelectricity (i.e., an electrical response to a mechanical stimulus, which is a desirable electronic property).  This work focuses on the rapid processing of PHB plastic materials into fibers and films with higher strength, improved toughness, and a piezoelectric response.  These new properties arise from a different arrangement of the PHB molecules in a crystalline lattice, obtained when spinning fibers or rapidly stretching films.  The resultant material can be ""locked"" into this new arrangement, which yields improved properties. This project is directed towards finding the appropriate conditions that maximize this new polymer structure, and could thus enable the production of sustainable plastics with new possibilities for packaging, environmental sensors, and electronic applications. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The processing of semi-crystalline polymers to produce films, fibers and molded articles involves manipulating the secondary and tertiary structure to produce the required macroscopic properties for the intended application.  Since the bulk of the processing methods are slow relative to the chain and segmental motion, generally the thermodynamically stable crystalline structure is obtained. It has been shown that when poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is copolymerized with hydroxyhexanoate (Hx) comonomers, using microbes, a random copolymer, PHBHx, is formed that exhibits very different properties compared to PHB homopolymer.  When these PHBHx copolymers are processed (e.g., electrospun from a polymer solution into nanofibers), a metastable beta crystalline form is produced in which the polymer backbones adopt a planar zig-zag conformation. This crystalline modification gives rise to a piezoelectric response and higher mechanical strength.  The focus of this research will address the following question: Under what conditions (solvent and solvent evaporation kinetics, high pressure and temperature, tensile deformation) can metastable crystalline form(s) be produced and stabilized and how do these phases affect the mechanical properties and the piezoelectric response of PHBHx as a function of Hx concentration?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials can absorb light and efficiently transport the energy or excitation (called excitons), making them attractive for solar energy conversion applications.  In addition, they support unique phenomena, such as the splitting of a single exciton into two lower-energy excitons, called singlet fission. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Chris Bardeen of the University of California, Riverside is combining novel sample preparation with time-resolved optical microscopy to study excitons in organic crystals.  The characterization of excitons in organic solids is challenging, since the fragile nature of the crystals makes it difficult to perform measurements.  Professor Bardeen and his students overcome this challenge by encapsulating these crystals beneath two-dimensional sheets of graphene or hexagonal boron nitride. These atomically thin layers form an optically transparent and chemically-resistant coating for the crystal. The encapsulated crystals are then studied using high-resolution microscopy techniques that can follow the excitons as they move through the crystal and undergo singlet fission . Insights from the work could advance our understanding of light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic cells. The project is also exploring implications for fields such as quantum computing. The project is providing the graduate and undergraduate students involved in this research with advanced training in spectroscopy, materials characterization, microscopy, and data analysis, as well as supporting outreach efforts to Taft Elementary School. Ongoing projects include science demonstrations for various grades, science fair tutorials, a day-long visit to UCR by the fourth-grade, and classroom visits by undergraduate volunteers. A hands-on experiment for third graders has been developed in which each student builds a customized solar-powered car.<br/><br/>The project focuses on prototypical molecular crystal semiconductors like perylene, tetracene ,and diphenylhexatriene.  Plate-like molecular crystals with variable thicknesses are grown and then covered with graphene and hexagonal boron nitride.  With this enabling technology in place, two categories of experiments are pursued.  The first involves measuring the properties of the encapsulated crystal and its interaction with the environment using microscopy and photoluminescence methods.  Questions that can be addressed include whether the exciton behavior in molecular crystals heterogeneous on length-scales down to 20 nm and whether it is possible to transfer energy and charge across the atomically thin membranes.  The second category of experiments focuses on new space and time-resolved experiments to determine whether spin-entangled states of triplet pairs produced by singlet fission can extend over mesoscopic distances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Support for this outcome is based upon the previous research by the team on the influence of tropical weather on mid-latitude weather, which has contributed to the development of the probabilistic subseasonal weather forecast method used by NOAA. This project will also train a graduate student to become an independent scientist. Besides participating in the usual activities of publishing papers and giving conference presentations, the team will work with personnel at Penn State's Center for Science and the Schools to conduct a five-day workshop on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction for middle and high school teachers from low socioeconomic and racially diverse urban and rural Pennsylvania school districts that serve populations highly underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math fields. The teachers will attend lectures on the techniques used for S2S forecasting, and  participate in relevant inquiry-based activities. The team will provide follow-up support as the teachers implement the workshop activities in their classrooms.<br/><br/>In the tropics, the dominant pattern on the intraseasonal time scale, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), is characterized by organized precipitation systems that propagate eastward encircling the tropics on a timescale of 30-70 days. The importance of the MJO for forecasting is evidenced by the use of the state of the MJO in week-3 and week-4 probabilistic forecasts by the NOAA/Climate Prediction Center. Although much progress has been made during the past three decades toward understanding how tropical convective heating influences the weather in mid-latitudes, there are still important unaddressed questions. This project will focus on questions that have not yet been investigated or have received little previous attention: (1)investigation of how Rossby waves are excited by MJO-related convection in the tropics propagate pole-ward,and impact weather in the mid-latitudes; (2) variation in the horizontal and vertical structure of the latent heat released in convections within the MJO event, and its impact in a key region, the central subtropical North Pacific; and (3) role of inertio-gravity waves excited by MJO-related convections in connecting tropical convections to weather over large distances across the Earth, e.g., teleconnection patterns. <br/><br/>The team will also address the following questions: Why does the high latitude component within teleconnection patterns persist for a much longer time period than do their lower latitude counterparts? What is the impact of inertio-gravity waves excited by the MJO on mid-latitude weather? The topic is particularly important because active teleconnection patterns have a large influence on the weather up to 6 weeks later. The approach includes the use of observational datasets and computer model calculations. The computer model will be used to isolate and to better understand the key physical processes that are responsible for the tropical-extratropical teleconnections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The network will advance research on the interconnected processes related to the precarious nature of housing such as evictions, homelessness and displacement, and plans to study them in tandem with forms of segregation and discrimination.  The RCN fills a gap in research by systematically analyzing community and policy responses that seek to create housing access and housing justice through legal frameworks, cooperative models of land and housing, and collective action.  An important aspect of the RCN is its coordination at the intersection of social movements, universities, and policy.  Paying close attention to housing movements and policy interventions, the RCN will synthesize the primary modalities of housing justice and its conceptual underpinnings into a Housing Justice Handbook that will be broadly disseminated.  Focused Summer Institutes with a diverse group of scholars looking at housing issues will be held in a variety of settings.  By integrating experience from a variety of contexts and settings, this RCN will generate new formats of university-community partnerships and engaged research in the United States focused on the experiences of marginalized social groups.  <br/><br/>This RCN builds a transnational, interdisciplinary, and intergenerational collaboration to tackle analytical and methodological problems pertaining to spatial exclusion.

In doing so, it builds data collection, data visualization, and story mapping tools that can capture the complex space-time geographies of housing precarity.  By developing novel methods of research dissemination and pedagogy that link key nodes of knowledge production in the Global South with those in the Global North, it fosters critical geographies of learning.

Additionally, in many vital areas of application, notably in geology or astrophysics, direct detailed observations are not available. The chaotic microscopic behavior can give rise, however, to very robust macroscopic structures, for example, the great red spot on Jupiter or pattern formation in chemical reactions, which can be studied by methods of statistical physics. A rigorous derivation of the existence and properties of such coherent patterns from the fundamental laws of physics is a notoriously difficult problem that requires additional assumptions that select typical solutions. These assumptions frequently include an addition of randomness, which models unknown influences, or a condition that the system equally explores all possible states. Then the existence and properties of statistical steady states of complex systems is accessible mathematically. This research project explores and further develops this important class of mathematical models.<br/><br/>The project branches in two directions. The first part focuses on properties of statistical invariant states for stochastically forced systems, especially their stability, dependence on parameters, and distribution on the state space. Special attention is given to the structure of the introduced forcing, as it is crucial for application, where the noise might act only in parts of the physical space or be localized is some scales. Although mainly problems arising from fluid dynamics are explored, equations originating in biology and chemistry are also considered. The second branch aims to gain more insight into the problems for which the addition of random forcing is not well motivated or it causes undesired behavior of the model, such as blow-up. Assuming the ergodic hypothesis, the large deviation principle implies that the system evolves toward thermodynamic equilibrium, and statistical solutions can be viewed as maximizers of an entropy, which effectively transforms evolution equations to variational problems.  The analysis of stability, observability, and qualitative properties of these so-called Gibbs states relies on variational methods, bifurcation theory, and investigation of associated Euler-Lagrange equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the fluids encountered in everyday life, such as water, gasoline, and honey, are well-understood (Newtonian) fluids, but many of the fluids related to industrial and biological applications are not. Common examples of non-Newtonian fluids include paint, multi-grade engine oils, laundry detergent, pediatric liquid medicines, pulmonary mucus, and cell membranes. A distinguishing feature of non-Newtonian fluids is microscopic structures that can be rearranged significantly during flow and consequently alter behavior over time and between circumstances. The goal of this research is to establish mathematical relationships between microstructural processes and flow properties in soft biological matter. Current advances in microscopy, flow measurement, theory and computation will lead to new models, allowing scientists to design and test next-generation biomaterials and investigate biological flows. Undergraduate and graduate students will not only be able to learn how to design and perform wet-lab experiments, formulate mathematical models and perform high-performance computational simulations, but also have opportunities to closely interact with researchers from mathematics, biology, physics and biomedical sciences. STEM students from the South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation program will be recruited as incoming freshmen to participate in a variety of research and educational activities supported by this project.  A second program, the SC Women in Science Luncheon, will bring together female undergraduate and graduate students for vertically-integrated research presentation, discussion and mentoring.

Fortunately, microorganisms have much to offer toward the development of environmentally-sound and energy-efficient processes to recycle these industrial waste streams. Sulfur and carbon dioxide also happen to be potential sources of energy and carbon for microorganisms called thermoacidophilic archaea that grow in extremely hot, acidic environments. One potential approach to dealing with the excess industrial sulfur and carbon dioxide is to engineer the metabolic pathways of these archaea such that they use the byproducts to produce chemicals of commercial value. This project will apply recently developed tools for genetically engineering extreme thermoacidophiles to create novel microorganisms. The study will examine the hypothesis that inserting sulfur oxidation genes from one organism into another will result in a new microorganism capable of converting carbon dioxide and sulfur into industrially-relevant organic chemicals. Engineering sulfur oxidation genes into microorganisms that naturally thrive under extreme conditions has many potential benefits. The ability to grow at hot and acidic conditions minimize risk of contamination by undesirable microorganisms and enables the bioprocess to be operated much like a conventional chemical process. The high heat tolerance of the microorganisms is also advantageous in recovering biochemical products with low boiling points. To broaden the educational impact and inclusiveness of this study, faculty and students at the North Carolina School for the Deaf (NCSD) will participate through biotechnology-based teaching modules. The modules will incorporate closed-captioning and other features to facilitate educational objectives for the deaf and hearing-impaired. Modules will be demonstrated on-site at NCSD. Additionally, the NCSU Biotechnology Program will host visiting middle school and high school students from NCSD for a day-long laboratory experience that will also familiarize them with higher educational opportunities. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to metabolically engineer strains of a model thermoacidophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM639, to produce chemicals from carbon dioxide (CO2) and reduced, inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs). Pangenomic analysis of the extremely thermoacidophilic archaea revealed the presence of a novel CO2 fixation cycle and key genes that can be recruited to enable S. acidocaldarius to oxidize sulfur. These unique biological characteristics will be exploited in the metabolic engineering of the naturally heat- and acid-tolerant organism. Metabolic engineering approaches will be informed by fundamental assessments of wild-type and recombinant S. acidocaldarius physiology. The specific objectives of this project are: (1) Create and characterize engineered S. acidocaldarius DSM639 strains that utilize CO2 as a carbon source and RISCs as energy sources. S. acidocaldarius encodes a cycle for CO2 fixation and an incomplete pathway for sulfur oxidation that can be repaired with genes recruited from chemolithoautotrophic Sulfolobales. (2) Demonstrate that a functional, biosynthetic, thermophilic pathway for acetone can be engineered into strains of S. acidocaldarius DSM639. Genes/enzymes have been identified that can be recruited from other thermophilic microorganisms to enable S. acidocaldarius to produce an industrial chemical from simple sugars. (3) Demonstrate that engineered strains of S. acidocaldarius DSM639 can produce acetone from CO2 as a carbon source and RISCs as energy sources. The goal is to obtain acetone production under chemolithoautotrophic conditions. (4) Establish, at bioreactor-scale, that engineered S. acidocaldarius DSM639 strains can produce acetone that can be recovered through in situ distillation. T-x-y information indicates that acetone-water mixtures form a two-phase system at aqueous acetone concentrations that will facilitate recovery as a process intensification step. The project will demonstrate the utility of extreme thermoacidophiles as versatile metabolic engineering platforms, presenting a unique approach toward bio-based chemical production from an industrial waste stream.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these applications, researchers are interested in detecting signals hidden in a noisy background which can usually be modeled as a random field. This project aims to derive theoretical properties of random fields and use these results to create efficient statistical tools to extract important and useful information from spatial data. This is done by focusing on specific features of random fields such as peaks, which serve as local representatives of the signal in their immediate vicinity. Thus, local signals can be discovered by detecting peaks whose height is above what would be expected by chance. This project develops such signal detection procedures with rigorous statistical inference theory. By identifying regions of brain activity in brain images to finding stellar objects against the cosmic background radiation, the aforementioned scientific disciplines will benefit from the proposed methods, which provide new efficient tools to analyze spatially dependent data and detect signals in the presence of noise.<br/><br/>This project will study critical points and excursion probabilities of Gaussian and related random fields, and then apply the obtained theoretical results to important statistical problems involving signal detection in image analysis, multiple hypothesis testing and parameter estimation. For critical points, the project will investigate exact computable formulas for the expected number, height distribution, and overshoot distribution, and establish approximations to the moments of the number of critical points. For excursion probabilities, the project will investigate the expected Euler characteristic approximation for smooth Gaussian fields with non-constant variance and for non-Gaussian fields, and fractional Brownian motion on manifolds.  As statistical applications, the project will devise tests for local maxima in non-stationary Gaussian noise and testing of cluster extent and mass for detecting signal regions.  In these applications, p-values are computed using the developed theory.  Statistical applications also include estimation of parameters in the height distribution of local maxima and detection of change-points. This project uses interdisciplinary tools from probability, statistics, and geometry to develop the desired theoretical results and statistical methods. It will create interesting connections between several mathematical areas involving topology and random matrices theory, and to other disciplines, including neuroimaging, cosmology, and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, teachers who have expertise working with students in the upper elementary grades might find themselves responsible for teaching first grade or kindergarten. Or, teachers with expertise in one area of science might find themselves responsible for teaching content in a different area (e.g., a teacher who is certified in biology might find herself responsible for teaching chemistry). Certification policies, the Next Generation Science Standards, and the creation of interdisciplinary STEM classes and schools will potentially result in more teachers being assigned out-of-field science teaching responsibilities. <br/><br/>Thirty participants--including educational researchers, science teacher educators, policy makers and elementary and secondary science teachers--will explore three questions: (1) What is the magnitude and variation of out-of-field science teaching in elementary and secondary science settings? (2) How do K-12 science teachers arrive at and negotiate out-of-field science teaching assignments? (3) What are the implications of out-of-field science teaching for those involved in science teacher preparation and professional development? The conference is unique in that it focuses on science teachers, addresses educational policy requirements; and looks at the spectrum of OOF teaching in science across the elementary, middle level, and high school grades. One potential outcome of the meeting is the establishment of a research agenda regarding out-of-field science teaching. Ultimately, the activities leading up to the conference, the conference, and the post-conference will allow for an understanding of the scope of out-of-field science teaching and science teachers' experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RM has a projected global market of $67.6 billion by 2020, and is capable of repairing, replacing and regenerating tissues and organs that are affected by disease/disorder, age, or injury. The common cell harvesting methods cause severe damage to cells, especially primary cells and stem cells. Our technology allows harvesting damage free cells, i.e., retaining essential cell functionalities and characteristics, which are superior for RM. Damage free cells will also enhance basic life science research by obtaining more clinical relevant results that cannot be achieved by using cell lines or damaged cells. While there is one commercially available thermo-responsive product being used to reduce cell damages during harvesting, it is too expensive to be adopted widely. Our technology is low cost, scalable, reproducible, and serves large growing markets. Through this project, we will identify key markets for adoption, correctly define the key product attributes, and understand scaling requirements, hence providing a source of high-quality stem and primary cells for critical medical research and applications.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will validate market potentials of applying thermo-responsive supports for damage free and chemical free cell harvesting, which is crucial for cell based regenerative medicine and basic life science research. Our technology for generating thermo-responsive supports employs a cost-effective and simple process that involves only 3 steps: blending, casting and thermal annealing of a thermo-responsive polymer and a network forming silane. During annealing, the silane molecules anchor to the surface while simultaneously forming networks to entrap polymer chains. Other reported thermo-responsive surfaces generally are prepared by using non-easily accessible electron beam irradiation or plasma polymerization to deposit a thermo-responsive layer, or painstakingly grow the thermo-responsive polymer on a surface. Also, as compared to the commercial product, our technology allows enhanced cell attachment and growth, and accelerated cell detachment upon cooling, thus avoiding cell damage. Therefore, our technology, described in research papers and patent protected, provides better platforms for commercial expansion of stem and primary cells and for basic research. In addition, our technology, with small scale samples, has been validated by another research group for a variety of applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The bilingual phenomenon of code-switching, or the use of two languages in a single linguistic unit, embodies this interaction of linguistic systems. This unit can be a conversation, a sentence or even a word. Although code-switching was previously thought to be a 'substandard' use of language, researchers have determined that it is in fact systematic and rule-governed. Thus, the study of code-switching provides a unique lens with which to view the rules that constrain language. A primary question of interest regards the minimal linguistic unit within which code-switching can occur. While it appears that a single word can be composed of morphemes (i.e., the smallest meaning-bearing linguistic unit) from two different languages, researchers have claimed that the sounds used to produce that word must come from a single language. However, these claims have never been tested empirically. <br/><br/>This dissertation project takes a laboratory phonology approach to determining the minimum linguistic unit within which a bilingual can combine elements from their two phonological (i.e., sound) systems. Intraword code-switching by Mexican Spanish/English early bilinguals will be examined using two experimental paradigms: a production study, and an aural acceptability judgment task. The results from these experiments will inform whether bilinguals produce phonologically switched words and accept phonologically switched words as licit outputs of their linguistic systems, thus confirming or rejecting the hypothesis that the word is the minimal unit for phonological code-switching. In addition to its theoretical contributions, dissemination of this research in the local Chicago community will contribute to the goal of informing the general public and bilingual educators/administrators about the use of code-switching as a standard bilingual speech practice that is rule governed like any natural language.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While modern advances in data science owe much progress to computational methods and the rapid growth in computer technology, statistics and applied probability are rife with examples where a careful mathematical analysis allows discoveries that no amount of computational power can uncover. This project is one such example and will use the PI's work on Yule's so called ""nonsense"" correlation, a 90-year old open problem that was solved last year via mathematical analysis tools. This explicit calculation showed the precise scale of the apparent correlation between two independent continuous series of data, such as what one encounters in economics, climate science, finance, and many other fields. This mathematical explanation of an apparent statistical paradox will enable the investigation of other important questions in mathematical statistics. The project will investigate a possible connection between some important open questions and a set of tools in probability theory whose power mathematical statisticians have only begun to investigate. The project will provide fertile ground for statistics graduate student training at Rice and Michigan State Universities; students will benefit from a wide scope of opportunities, from rigorous study of mathematical tools, to their use in statistics, to applications in fields of great societal value.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the probability law of the Pearson correlation between two independent or dependent Gaussian processes. Analyses of distributions in the second Wiener chaos (quadratic forms of normals) are a new set of tools that will be brought to bear. Those tools are flexible enough to handle any Gaussian process via their so-called Karhunen-Loeve expansions. In terms of applications, what is most striking is that any statistical estimation or test based on these projected studies would only require a single or a pair of observations; this is particularly useful for situations, such as in environmental statistics or in economics, where experiments cannot be designed, and one has to work with the available observable data collected dynamically in time. The second emphasis in this study, on Polya frequency functions and related densities, uses some of the same mathematical tools, thanks to a realization that the densities can be represented and expanded explicitly in the second Wiener chaos. The project seeks to prove when a density is strongly log-concave (e.g. its logarithm has a second derivative which is bounded away from zero.) This question, which in mathematical statistics is phrased more broadly in terms of Polya frequency functions, has distribution of sums of independent and non-identically distributed exponentials, expands to the case of general second-chaos distributions. The project could have important consequences in the practice of statistics, especially in areas where comparing non-trivial time series is a challenge, and in many scientific fields informed by properties of log-concavity and strong log-concavity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When one of the spaces is a well-understood `model' space, comparison geometry often provides optimal estimates that are useful for other areas of mathematics (for example, playing an essential role in the resolution of the Poincare conjecture) as well as other sciences.  In this project, the principal investigator will use comparison geometry to estimate the fundamental gap for domains in smooth manifolds.  This gap is the difference between the first two eigenvalues of the Laplacian: to explain this, the Laplacian frequently occurs in mathematical physics when modelling the propagation of waves through various media, and the eigenvalues are the resonant frequencies of the domain.  The mass gap is also related to quantum mechanics, where it represents the energy needed to excite a particle from its ground state to the next energy level. Advancement in this project will thus have potential benefits in mathematics and physics.  The PI also plans to estimate the volume entropy for non-smooth spaces known as metric measure spaces, and the PI's results on entropy rigidity will be relevant to optimal transport, information geometry and discrete geometry.  This project will also support education and training of graduate students and young researchers, through postdoctoral mentoring and teaching.<br/> <br/>This project is concerned with several problems centered around comparison geometry. By comparing to a good model, comparison geometry often provides optimal estimates.  For example, Perelman's reduced volume monotonicity, which is the fundamental tool in his work on the Poincare and geometrization conjectures, can be viewed as generalization of Bishop-Gromov volume comparison to Ricci flow. Andrews and Clutterbuck proved the fundamental gap conjecture by showing the first eigenfunction is more log-concave than the model.  The PI will study the eigenvalue and fundamental gap comparison estimates for the Laplacian (with Dirichlet boundary conditions) on a convex domain in locally symmetric spaces, and on closed manifolds (with Neumann boundary conditions) with integral Ricci curvature lower bound and non-smooth extensions.  The PI will also study the relation between comparison geometry and Ricci flow (including almost rigidity results for Ricci flow) as well as volume entropy comparison and rigidity for metric measure spaces with curvature lower bounds. Volume entropy is a fundamental geometric invariant for compact smooth manifolds, and this concept is closely related to other notions of entropy found in dynamical systems.  It plays an essential role in differential geometry and geometric group theory (among others), and studying the non-smooth case will have applications to Gromov-Hausdorff limits of smooth manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Robert Crosnoe at the Population Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating STEM experiences among Mexican-origin students in K-12 education in new and established Latino/a destinations. By focusing on the fast-growing and disadvantaged Mexican-origin student population, this research addresses racial/ethnic inequality in STEM participation. The study will identify aspects of communities and schools that help or hinder positive STEM experiences among Mexican-origin students, which can inform policy interventions to increase participation in STEM fields among this underrepresented group. This research thus seeks to broaden STEM participation in a growing and vulnerable population in U.S. schools while supporting the career development of a scholar dedicated to this goal.   <br/><br/>This project focuses on the ways in which K-12 schools in both traditional and emerging Latino/a destinations in the U.S. shape Mexican-origin student experiences in STEM with three primary objectives: 1) To determine whether Mexican-origin students attending schools in new destinations have lower STEM participation and achievement than Mexican-origin students in established communities; 2) To investigate whether systematic differences in school contexts across Latino/a destinations explain such STEM disparities between Mexican-origin students in new versus established destinations, and; 3) To examine whether variability in school contexts within new and established Latino/a destinations moderates links between destinations and STEM participation and achievement among Mexican-origin students. The Postdoctoral Fellow will pursue these goals with quantitative analyses of datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics. This research will draw from and contribute to disciplinary fields including sociology, demography, and education. This work will advance inquiry into STEM outcomes among underrepresented groups and will contribute to debates about immigrant-receiving contexts and incorporation among the Mexican-origin population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Optimal error rates in such estimation problems are often rather slow due to the ``curse of dimensionality"", and it becomes increasingly important to identify low-dimensional structures and features of high-dimensional parameters that could be estimated efficiently with error rates common in classical, ``low-dimensional"" statistics. Such features are often represented by functionals that depend smoothly of unknown parameters and the goal is to take advantage of their smoothness to develop efficient estimation procedures. The problems of this nature often occur in a variety of applications such as signal and image processing, machine learning and data analytics.  The purpose of this project is to study these problems systematically and to develop new approaches to efficient estimation of smooth functionals. The project is in an interdisciplinary area between mathematics, statistics and computer science and it includes a number of activities to facilitate interactions with researchers in these areas and to ensure the impact of proposed research on education. <br/><br/>The main focus of the project is on the development of general methods of estimation of smooth functionals of covariance operators based on high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional observations. It is expected that these methods will be applicable to other important high-dimensional  models such as Gaussian shift models (both in vector and in matrix case); linear regression models (including trace regression and regression models in quantum state tomography); some non-linear models. The methods to be developed include a new approach to bias reduction in smooth functional estimation problems based on iterative application of bootstrap (bootstrap chains) and concentration and normal approximation bounds needed to establish asymptotic efficiency of estimators with reduced bias. The goal is to determine optimal smoothness thresholds for functionals of interest that ensure their efficient estimation, in particular, in a dimension free high-complexity setting, with complexity of the problem characterized by the effective rank of the true covariance. Other directions include the study of efficient estimation of smooth functionals under regularity assumptions on the parameter set and applications of methods of functional estimation to hypotheses testing for high-dimensional parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Following each disaster, large numbers of core as well as situational researchers from locally-affected areas and across the nation, many with NSF RAPID grant funding, launch new studies to understand the impacts of these events on both the affected population and the built environment, to explore the root causes of the disasters, and to trace long-term recovery trajectories among population groups and across communities. This special workshop provides a forum to take stock of what the community has learned from past disaster reconnaissance research and to develop best practices for future disaster investigations.  The workshop is open to all members of the hazards and disasters research community and will convene engineers, social scientists, and public health researchers who received NSF RAPID grants in 2017 as well as those who have ongoing hazard and disaster research projects. The funds will be used principally to support travel costs for NSF RAPID awardees making presentations at the workshop. This workshop will contribute significantly to the NSF mission of promoting the progress of science in our understanding of hazards and advancing the national health and prosperity by using this understanding to reduce damage from future events.<br/><br/>This work will improve rapid reconnaissance research.

By diagnosing tumors at an early stage, the proposed device will save tremendous amounts of time, effort, and patient discomfort and provide significant cost reductions for both the individual patient and the nation?s healthcare system.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project investigates potential commercial markets for a new skin cancer imaging device developed based on the ""Synthetic Ultra-Wideband Millimeter-wave Imaging"" approach. In this approach, an ultra-wide imaging bandwidth in the millimeter-wave regime that cannot be realized by any conventional design method is assembled synthetically, resulting in significant improvements in the resolution of the acquired images. This approach is expected to enable the millimeter-wave imaging technology to be applied to skin imaging and skin cancer detection. The proposed technology has proven to be effective through proof-of-concept experiments. Firstly, statistically significant contrasts have been observed between the millimeter-wave dielectric properties of normal skin and two of the most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These results verify the potential of the proposed system to provide histopathological-contrast-based evaluations of skin lesions. Furthermore, the feasibility of employing the proposed imaging method for skin cancer detection has been confirmed using realistic skin-mimicking phantoms containing spherical tumor models. The final developed product will be a hand-held, point-of-care millimeter-wave imaging device which provides significantly higher image resolutions compared to the state-of-the-art technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zhdankin of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of Minnesota Duluth is developing new classes of oxidizing agents. Oxidizing agents are important tools for the construction of a wide variety of molecules. The approach Professor Zhdankin and his group is developing utilizes polyvalent iodine compounds because they are efficient and environmentally more ""friendly"" that the reagents currently used. The iodine based systems work because iodine is one of the heaviest elements in the Periodic Table classified as a non-metal. Hence, these more sustainable reagents mimic the structural features and reactivity pattern heavy, frequently toxic transition metals they are being used to replace. It is also important to note that the reagents are new. As such, they can be used to not only replicate existing methods, but also to develop entirely new reactions. The project lies at the interface of organic and inorganic chemistry and it is well suited for undergraduate education as well as for training of scientists at all levels. Professor Zhdankin's group has a long history of providing the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science. <br/><br/>Professor Zhdankin and his group are pursuing a broad study of new, metal-free, iodine-mediated reactions. In this effort, they are searching for new hypervalent reagents, and they are exploring the new modes of reactivity those reagents enable.  Specific objectives of this project include the study of arylbenziodoxaboroles as efficient benzyne precursors, the development of new carbene precursors based on phenolic iodonium salts, the study of arylation reactions with phenolic diaryliodonium salts, and the study of phosphonium-iodonium ylides as reagents for synthesis of trifluoromethyl-substituted alkenes. In a second effort, Professor Zhdankin is searching for stable and potentially useful hypervalent iodine complexes with mesoionic carbenes. The new synthetic methodology based on organohypervalent iodine chemistry is contributing to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as it utilizes non-toxic compounds of iodine as catalysts or recyclable reagents in aqueous solutions.  Successful development of this methodology is having an impact on how the synthesis of molecules relevant to the pharmaceutical, chemical, and agricultural industries is approached. This project provides excellent training to students at all levels of education including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to use the higher dimensionality of the spatial degree of freedom of quantum states of light in a long-distance quantum network can bring about an analogous revolution to the field of quantum information science by making it possible to transmit large amounts of information through a quantum channel. This CAREER project will study the use of spatial quantum correlations in entangled beams of light to provide more control over the spatial degree of freedom with the goal of making it compatible with long-distance quantum networks. This will enable new possibilities for the use of this degree of freedom in applications that range from long-distance quantum communications to quantum imaging. The research will be integrated with an educational program that seeks to develop the problem-solving skills of the undergraduate students through their active participation in research and the introduction of quantum optics experiments in the undergraduate teaching laboratories. It will also provide educational outreach opportunities for the general public through the involvement of high-school teachers from the NSF RET program in the development of didactical quantum optics demonstrations. Active efforts will be made to involve underrepresented groups, such as Native Americans, Hispanics, and women, in the research and educational programs.<br/><br/>The spatial degree of freedom has been recognized to hold the promise for significant impact in the field of quantum information science due to its large dimensionality. However, this promise has largely been unfulfilled due to the limited capabilities that exist in terms of the control and manipulation of this degree of freedom and its incompatibility with long-distance networks. The goal of this CAREER project is to demonstrate the compatibility of the spatial degree of freedom of quantum states of light with long-distance quantum networks. This will be done through the control of the distribution of the spatial quantum correlations present in continuous-variable (CV) entangled twin beams generated through a four-wave mixing process in a double-lambda configuration in rubidium vapor. The focus on CVs will make it possible to overcome important limitations that result from the probabilistic nature of the more commonly used discrete domain approach. In particular, CVs allow for a deterministic implementation of quantum protocols. This is particularly important for applications, such as quantum repeaters, in which the low yield rate that results from the probabilistic occurrence of events leads to impractical constraints on the apparatus. Among other things, this CAREER project will provide a source capable of generating CV entangled states of light whose distribution of spatial quantum correlations can be engineered. This will enable the use of the spatial degree of freedom in quantum information applications such as secure communications, information processing, and distributed quantum computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The heavy-tailed character of the distribution of empirical data has been repeatedly observed in many fields of research, including microarray studies in genomics, neuroimaging in medicine, and portfolio optimization and risk management in finance. In functional MRI studies, the parametric statistical methods often fail to produce valid cluster-wise inference, where the principal cause is that the spatial autocorrelation functions do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape; in finance, the power-law nature of the distribution of returns has been validated as a stylized fact over the years. The least squares method, albeit being most commonly used in practice due to its simplicity as a once-for-all solution, is sensitive to the tails of sample distributions and is proven to be suboptimal for heavy-tailed data from a non-asymptotic viewpoint. In this project, the PI will develop robust statistical procedures for various problems, ranging from mean estimation, linear regression, high-dimensional sparse regression to large covariance matrix estimation. The main goals of this research are to understand the finite-sample properties of robust learning, and to develop computationally efficient procedures that advance the practical use of robust methods.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will study robust alternatives to the method of least squares for two fundamental problems: linear regression and covariance estimation. To achieve robustness against asymmetric and heavy-tailed data, the main idea is to use the adaptive Huber loss and its extension on the matrix space. From a non-asymptotic viewpoint, the accompanying scale parameter should adapt to the sample size, dimension and noise level for optimal tradeoff between the gain in stability and cost in bias. The work on the project aims to (i) develop new methods for robust estimation and inference under linear models, and investigate their mathematical underpinnings using techniques from concentration inequality in probability, finite-sample theory for M-estimation in statistics and convex analysis in optimization, and (ii) construct both general and structured large covariance matrix estimators under minimal assumptions on the data. The originality of the project resides in providing new perspectives on robustness, which not only represent useful complements to classical robust statistics but also make important contributions to modern statistical analysis, including high dimensional estimation and large-scale inference. The philosophy of the project echos John Tukey's principles for statistical practice by highlighting the importance of having methods of statistical analysis that are robust to violations of the assumptions underlying their use and allowing the possibility of data's influencing the choice of method by which they are analyzed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They appear extensively in nature and are prevalent in human-generated data such as financial time series, sound files, and internet traffic patterns. By their very nature fractals are rough, non-differentiable objects that cannot be studied by the classical mathematical methods of calculus. The more modern tools of multifractal analysis, which quantify the degree of roughness that appears on various scales, can be used instead. It is particularly interesting to apply multifractal analysis to randomly generated objects, which by default tend to exhibit fractal behavior. Random measures, which for example describe the rainfall distribution over a particular state or the distribution of energy in turbulent fluid flows, are a particularly fruitful area for employing multifractal analysis. The results of such an analysis can often be used for prediction and forecasting of the underlying random system. This research project aims to further develop the mathematical foundations for analysis of multifractal properties.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to analyze the multifractal properties of a broad class of random measures that appear in models of statistical mechanics. The focus will be on random pinning models, random polymer models, random measures arising in two-dimensional conformally invariant systems, and spectral measures of random matrices. In all cases, the major quantity of interest will be the multifractal spectrum, which quantifies the amount of mass the random measure assigns around various points in the space. Computation of the multifractal spectrum is closely related to the theory of large deviations for computing the decay of probabilities of rare events. Many of the tools from that theory will be employed in this project, including the notion of Gibbs condition for describing the most likely behavior of the random system when a rare event occurs. As all the random measures listed above can be described using tools from stochastic analysis, specifically the Wiener chaos decomposition, a particular goal of this project will be to incorporate tools from stochastic analysis into this theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology is vital for intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection for in vitro fertilization, drug response assays in cancer research, and fabrication of bioengineered tissues in regenerative medicine. However, even with the existing tools and protocols, one of the main factors that affects the success of these procedures is still the skill of the operator. There is an unmet need for a sensing technique that provides quantitative and reliable information, rather than experiences or intuition alone, to help operators make a correct decision. This project aims to meet this need by providing a method of real-time micro/mesoscale manipulation based on 3D imaging and micro-scale force sensing. This will be accomplished by building a manipulator system comprised of microfabricated cantilever force sensors and arrayed microscopes to provide suitable real-time visual feedback to the operator. As all the data gathered by this system is digital, the system can be remotely viewed and controlled via the internet, which makes the system an excellent platform for STEM education. The team will work with a local high school to develop and test educational biological experiments for K-12 students. This will enhance their learning by providing application-based research methods otherwise not available to students.<br/><br/>Elastography is an emerging imaging modality to quantify the elasticity of tissues. When a mechanical force is applied to a tissue, the induced internal strain distribution indicates the map of elasticity. Soft regions show larger deformation compared to the hard regions, and vice versa. This elasticity map provides crucial information needed for medical diagnosis or guidance of surgical tools. The use of elastography is currently based on ultrasound imaging to observe macroscale organs in the size range of a few centimeters. The central hypothesis to be investigated is that the benefit of elastography can be scaled down to tissues that are about 100 times smaller than those studied in conventional ultrasound elastography. The goal of the project is to establish the method of real-time micro/mesoscale elastography that targets biosamples between 0.1 millimeters and 1 millimeter in size. A real-time micro/mesoscale tissue manipulation system will be developed to provide quantitative 3D force-deformation analysis to enable operators to reliably manipulate tissues and make informed diagnostic choices. The two key enabling technologies are microscale cantilever-based manipulation and 3D real-time tomography. As the force-sensing cantilever applies a force to the sample, multi-angle images are simultaneously acquired from the 16-arrayed microscopes to reconstruct high-resolution 3D images. Maps of 3D deformation will be generated to find the strains induced within the sample and the cantilever. Knowing the mechanical stiffness of the cantilever, the stress induced in the sample will be found. Since the proposed method is based on optical deformation analysis, it will provide force sensing capabilities without using electrical force sensors. Not only the microfabricated cantilevers but also conventional tools including glass tubes and needles will be used with the added function of force sensing, once their stiffness is calibrated. The efficacy of the system will be validated through manipulation of 3D microtissues and sperm injection experiments using zebrafish eggs. The ability to visualize and manipulate micro/mesoscale objects plays an important role in many emerging biomedical applications. However, mechanical tools that focus on samples in such size scales are still in their infancy. The proposed research is among the first steps in this direction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Engineering properties of materials to make them technology critical, such as special optical, structural or magnetic functionalities, is generally achieved by controlling the chemical composition of compounds. The PI will investigate a much less explored strategy - attaining target functionalities by assembling simple, known building block materials into various geometric shapes without changing their compositions. For example, quantum mechanics-based theory calculations suggest that the design of concentric alternate shells of Silicon and Germanium around a core of silicon can deliver novel optical properties that are altogether absent from the constituent building blocks. Similarly, a designed assembly of needles made from the element Molybdenum and any one of a class of elements known as chalcogenides can deliver a new state of electronic matter that is unknown in more common three-dimensional geometric shapes. By combining computer simulations of solid materials based on quantum mechanics with materials design principles, the PI aims to develop novel ways to predict emerging properties of materials, such as unique optical and magnetic properties. This project will benefit from collaboration with experimentalists at Tel Aviv University. Graduate students and postdocs will be encouraged to develop college-level teaching experience through a program at the University of Colorado. The project includes an outreach seminar activity to a broad audience.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education to advance the capability to design materials with specific functionality. The quest for attaining outstanding physical properties of materials historically involved synthesis of new individual compounds of ever increasing complexity. But not all such compounds have delivered the optimal properties technologists wished to have for applications in particular devices. A recent alternative has been to seek desired functionalities from superstructuring, as well as exploration of reduced dimensionality, using common compound building blocks that by themselves may lack interesting properties. The PI builds upon his recent work on geometric and dimensionality design to obtain emergent properties that greatly supersede or are even qualitatively absent from those attainable from the individual compound building blocks. The approach involves the search for specific superstructure patterns or polymorphs with specific reduced symmetries that deliver unusual, emergent quantum properties. Specific explorations within this generally unexplored research field include: (i) engineering a direct band gap in core-multi-shell 1D-superstructures from indirect gap Si and Ge components and the Giant Rashba effect, (ii) investigating the coexistence of metallic and insulating properties, and the emergence of novel electronic states in 1D-polymorph of transition-metal mono-chalcogenides, (iii) finding topological systems by superstructuring of topologically trivial ordinary components through energy stabilization of metastable states or internal electric fields. The number of possible configurations afforded by superstructuring is so large that high-throughput approaches, experimental or computational, are impractical. The PI will approach such nanostructures as a design problem, using functionality-driven search and discovery that combines (a) electronic structure methods with (b) screening for stability and (c) evolutionary search where needed, to identify the ""magic configurations"" that have both stability and interesting target properties. Superstructuring will lead to better understanding of the critical enabling factors of the intriguing quantum properties, as well as have the practical advantage of creating new functionalities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Animal pollinators are critical to the reproduction and survival of most flowering plants, including many of our agricultural crops. Conventional wisdom holds that animal pollinators also have a primary role in driving the diversification of these species. However, this idea has rarely been tested in detail and at scale. Researchers will test this hypothesis using Burmeistera, a flowering plant genus whose 116 species depend on nectar-feeding bats for pollination. Burmeistera species place their pollen on different parts of the bats' heads, which may reduce the exchange of pollen and genes between species. They also have different degrees of genetic incompatibility with each other. These genetic barriers may reduce the fertilization success of cross-species pollinations or the survival of hybrid offspring. Researchers will evaluate which of these reproductive barriers contributes to each stage of the speciation process in Burmeistera. Undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, will be involved in all aspects of the project and will be trained in field and laboratory techniques. The project will also support the professional development of a post-doctoral researcher. Researchers will communicate results to the public via educational displays at the Missouri Botanical Garden and bilingual field guides for Burmeistera species.<br/><br/>This project will discover how reproductive barriers evolve during angiosperm speciation using an integrated experimental and comparative approach. Researchers will construct a robust species-level phylogeny for Burmeistera (Campanulaceae, the bell-flower family) using DNA sequence data from whole plastomes and over 700 nuclear loci. They will then measure pre- and post-pollination reproductive barriers among pairs of species having different phylogenetic distances. Assessment will include cross-pollination trials by captive nectar-feeding bats as well as hand-crosses of species in cultivation. Researchers will compare these measures within the context of the phylogeny to test the hypothesis that post-pollination reproductive barriers evolve before others. They will also determine whether changes in the length of pollen-bearing and receiving organs of Burmeistera flowers are correlated with speciation events, which would be consistent with the hypothesis of pollinator-driven speciation. Project outcomes will include an exceptionally detailed exploration of angiosperm speciation processes, improved taxonomic circumscriptions within a poorly-studied Neotropical flowering plant group, and the creation of new genetic resources and herbarium collections.

When biological organisms grow, they regulate the size that they reach: for example, people grow to their adult height and then remain that tall. Therefore, sensing and regulating size is an essential physics problem that biological organisms solve. Living systems control the size not just of whole organisms, but also of smaller internal structures (organs, cells, and structures inside cells). The physical principles and mechanisms underlying the sensing and control of size in biology are not well understood. This project will develop new physics-based models to understand and predict how length of one class of subcellular structures are regulated in organisms. Related mechanisms may be useful in regulating the growth of polymers and biomaterials.  This project will develop interdisciplinary research and education, and work to improve diversity in science.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research, and education on the fundamental mechanisms that determine size of living organisms and biomimetic biomaterials. Regulating physical size is an essential problem that biological organisms must solve, but the physical principles and mechanisms underlying the sensing and control of size in biology are not well understood. The regulation of polymer length is important for the organization of the cellular cytoskeleton, which affects the size of subcellular organelles such as the mitotic spindle and the structure of cells themselves. An important general question is how to use molecular-level information to understand and predict higher-order aspects of assembly and organization. Remarkably, many cytoskeletal assemblies can maintain a constant, self-organized length, even though they are nonequilibrium structures with constant molecular turnover. While significant previous work has focused on steady-state spindle length, the PI aims to advance understanding of dynamic spindle length regulation. Results from this work will provide a basis for developing predictive understanding of dynamic length regulation and cytoskeletal self-assembly. <br/>The work is built on theoretical and modeling tools, including tractable analytic models, semi-analytic and numerical analysis, simplified simulation models, and detailed three-dimensional simulations. This project will address how length regulation and its dynamic stabilization can emerge as a collective property as the level of cytoskeletal assembly changes from single filaments, filament bundles, and the mitotic spindle. The work will focus on two scientific questions. First, what are the general mechanisms of length sensing of single cytoskeletal filaments, bundles, and higher-order assemblies? While previous length-sensing work has assumed monotonically length-dependent processes, this work will conduct a wide-ranging theoretical investigation into classes of length sensing, inspired by currently known biological processes. Second, what types of feedback and amplification lead to dynamically stable or unstable length regulation? Recent work demonstrates that mitotic spindle length is dynamically stabilized at a steady state value, and that this stabilization can be perturbed, causing large length fluctuations. The work will perform a general investigation of classes of feedback and amplification that lead to dynamically stable or unstable length of cytoskeletal assemblies. Mechanisms explored in the research may be applicable to regulating the growth of polymers and biomaterials.<br/>The work will provide insight into biologically relevant general mechanisms of length sensing and regulation, by determining how bundling, spatially non-monotonic activity, and force-dependent regulation can effect length sensing. The work will develop understanding of the dynamic stabilization, and investigate whether there are different characteristic modes of dynamic destabilization. Research advances may have applicability to growth of biomaterials and soft materials more generally. This project will also test mechanical contributions to spindle length stabilization, by considering how spindle components contribute forces and feedback that enable constant, stable spindle length. This will improve understanding of collective self-assembly in cells. The project is an integrated interdisciplinary program of theoretical biophysics and statistical mechanics informed by cell biology and genetics to gain insight into cytoskeletal length regulation and stabilization.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>There are an estimated 2-4 billion specimens in the world's natural history collections that contain the data necessary to address complex global issues, including biodiversity and climate. Digitized natural history collections present an untapped opportunity to engage learners in crucial questions of science with far-reaching potential consequences via object-based research investigations.  This project will develop and study a prototype online learning environment that supports student learning via Engaging Practices for Inquiry with Collections in Bioscience (EPIC Bioscience). EPIC Bioscience uses authentic research investigations with digitized collections from natural history museums.  The project team will create a curriculum aligned with the Next Generation of Science Standards (NGSS) for middle school students, emphasizing a major disciplinary core idea in grades 6-8 life science, Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics. The project has three major goals: 1) Develop an online learning environment that guides students through research investigations using digitized natural history collections to teach NGSS life science standards. 2) Investigate how interactive features and conversational scaffolds in the EPIC Bioscience learning environment can promote deeper processing of science content and effective knowledge building. 3) Demonstrate effective approaches to using digitized collections objects for contextualized, research-based science learning that aligns to NGSS standards for middle school classrooms.<br/><br/>The project will examine how and when interactive features of a digital learning environment can be combined with deep questions and effective online scaffolds to promote student engagement, meaningful collaborative discourse, and robust learning outcomes during research with digitized museum collections. Research activities will address: How can interactive features of EPIC Bioscience help students learn disciplinary core ideas and cross cutting concepts via science practices through collections-based research? How can effective patterns of collaborative scientific discourse be supported and enhanced during online, collections-based research? How does the use of digitized scientific collections influence students' levels of engagement and depth of processing during classroom investigations? A significant impact of the proposed work is expanded opportunities for research with authentic museum objects for populations who are traditionally underserved in STEM and are underrepresented in museum visitor demographics (Title I schools, racial/ethnic minorities, and rural school populations).

A key ingredient is the electron spin. Quantum mechanically, the electron behaves like a very tiny top, and because of its charge like a tiny magnet as well. As the electron moves through the crystalline lattice, the electric field of the nuclei looks like a magnetic field which interacts with the magnetic character of the electron and so, the direction of its spin. In this research project, the PI will develop a theoretical description of electrons that interact strongly with each other and with the periodic lattice of nuclei through its spin in natural and artificially constructed crystalline materials. The PI will investigate a phenomenon which results from the interplay between the electrons interacting with the lattice and electrons interacting with each other; this leads to a new type of spin wave which might be used to carry data in computing devices. These spin waves can provide transfer of spin information over macroscopic distances with virtually no loss of energy, and allow for the implementation of new computing concepts.

To understand brain function, it is therefore paramount to efficiently measure and analyze neuronal network architecture. However, measuring the connectivity of large neuronal networks remains a challenge both experimentally and theoretically. An often more tractable approach to reconstructing connectivity in complex networks is to instead measure the dynamics of neurons of interest, and then use mathematical approaches to infer the network connectivity. This project will utilize the widespread sparsity found in brain networks to develop an efficient mathematical framework for reconstructing neuronal connectivity from limited measurements of neuronal dynamics. Upon accurately recovering the architecture of neuronal networks, this project will investigate how the sparse structure of natural stimuli impacts the early development of neuronal connectivity and what functional implication this has in the encoding of diverse classes of sensory signals. Analyzing the neuronal dynamics that optimally encode network connectivity and stimulus information, this project will provide new insights into sensory processing and abnormal brain function. In formulating novel methodologies for processing dynamic network data, this project will inform advances in artificial intelligence and prosthetics. This work will actively involve undergraduate students in all phases of research, promoting interdisciplinary scientific collaboration and deepening the scope of applied mathematics education for a diverse spectrum of students.<br/><br/>With the increasing prevalence of network models in the mathematical sciences, accurately measuring network structure and understanding its relationship with network function is of broad scientific importance. In neuroscience in particular, efficiently measuring large-scale brain connectivity and determining its impact on cognitive function is inherently challenging yet fundamental in characterizing the nature of computation in the brain. This project will formulate a novel framework for the reconstruction and characterization of neuronal connectivity by taking advantage of the widespread network sparsity found in the brain and utilizing recent advances in compressive-sensing (CS) theory.  Key facets of the project are to: (1) develop a novel CS-based mean-field approach for efficiently reconstructing sparse connections in physiological neuronal networks based on underlying input-output mappings embedded in the nonlinear network dynamics; (2) analyze the role of the balanced network operating regime in CS reconstruction of recurrent network connectivity; (3) investigate the basis for structural motifs in the visual system through supervised learning of neuronal connectivity aimed at optimized compressive encoding of sparse visual stimuli; and (4) characterize the functional role of  receptive field structure in the encoding of natural scenes through compressive network dynamics and the manifestation of related deficiencies in processing non-natural scenes, such as illusory images. This work will underline how the network dynamical regime impacts the inference of structural connectivity and network inputs from neuronal dynamics, improving the scale over which neuronal connectivity can be determined and providing novel insights into abnormal information processing in the brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While fire is an important part of the ecology of healthy California forests, Sudden Oak Death is a recently introduced disease that has killed millions of trees in coastal California over the past 20 years. Disease-killed trees serve as fuel and may increase the risk for the ignition, spread, and increased intensity of wildfires.  While fire and disease both cause extensive tree death, each disturbance type results in different types of impacts and recovery of forests. To that end, the proposed research seeks to determine how multiple, and altered, disturbances interact to determine the composition of the regenerating plant community and shape the severity, frequency, and timing of future disturbances.  The threat of wildfire plays a major role in policy decisions in many communities throughout California and the western United States. The cost of fighting wildfires has increased dramatically as more people live in locations in and near forests. Understanding how disease and fire interact to impact forests is important in fighting fires, protecting communities, and in aiding the recovery of forests after catastrophic fire and disease outbreak.<br/><br/>Disease-fire interactions in Big Sur forests will be examined across an 80,000 ha plot network that was established in 2006 to study Sudden Oak Death. Large fires burned across the plot network in 2008 and in 2016, providing an opportunity to study disease-fire interactions at a very large scale.  Initial results from the Big Sur plot network indicate that these forest ecosystems are moving toward novel disturbance regimes with complex interactions between disease and fire, impacting tree and shrub species that are otherwise resilient to either disturbance. Increases in wildfire severity due to the presence of disease can increase mortality of tree species not susceptible to disease, alter forest assemblages and biogeochemical cycles, and ultimately, create the context for how the joint disturbances of fire and disease and will re-emerge across the landscape. The research approach includes monitoring the vegetation, pathogens, and soil nutrients of the long-term field plots, laboratory quantification of pathogens, as well as statistical modeling. The proposed research plan anticipates that the dramatic tree mortality due to Sudden Oak Death in Big Sur will continue for many years, thereby influencing fuel loading and subsequently natural fire regimes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will utilize the most advanced analytical techniques to investigate sulfur chemistry, many of which were developed recently by participants on the research team. This project will yield new insights into the capability of magmatic systems beneath volcanoes to accumulate reservoirs of eruptible sulfur large enough to create significant global environmental impacts. This work will support several early-career researchers, and will engage a diverse group of undergraduate students to participate at City University of New York (CUNY) and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). <br/><br/>The project exploits the complex geochemical behavior of sulfur to track its movement from the liquid phase (silicate melt) into solid (mineral) and gas phases in magmatic systems. Sulfur is a polyvalent element that can change its valence state from S2- to S6+ over a narrow redox range relevant for terrestrial magmatic systems. This makes sulfur an excellent tracer for changes in magma redox conditions that may have played a critical role in the transport, enrichment, and release of sulfur during the 1257 Mt. Samalas eruption. The involved magmatic processes (e.g., degassing) should lead to predictable fractionations of sulfur isotopes in glasses and minerals, which will further constrain the dynamics of sulfur build-up at Samalas. The valence states of sulfur in minerals and glasses will be determined via X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, whereas sulfur isotope ratios will be measured by secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS). This dovetailing of redox and isotope studies is a powerful new approach to addressing sulfur-related science questions. This project will serve as a blueprint for future studies of other volcanic systems and will have implications for magmatic sulfide ore-forming processes and crustal magma evolution of interest to the broader Earth science community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, a major limitation in the early determination of the toxicity of drugs is the reliance on experiments in animals whose responses to drugs often cannot predict human responses. This project aims to develop innovative devices and methods that combine the culturing of human kidney cells and impedance (a complex form of resistance)-based sensing techniques in a microfluidic system. These microfluidic systems will be developed to replicate the physiological behavior needed for studying the toxicity of drugs upon the human kidney, thus serving as an advanced drug screening method with the potential for increased accuracy and lower cost.

To simulate the proximal tubule, biochips will be developed featuring a central, topographically patterned, porous membrane within this bilayer microfluidic device.  Impedance sensing-based components will be integrated into this system using microfabrication techniques.

For each exposure, the impedance spectra of the model cells will be recorded and calibrated, making use of data on cell damage derived from conventional assessments of toxicity and cell viability.

Recently, they also have recognized that rapid, contemporary evolution can alter those species interactions. This project moves beyond asking if rapid evolution is important to asking when it is important. In some communities, it may be impossible to understand the ecology without accounting for ongoing evolutionary change. However, scientists do not yet understand the underlying rules that govern when evolution strongly influences species interactions and when it might be reasonably ignored by ecologists and conservation biologists. This project will investigate two factors that may limit the effects of rapid evolution on ecological processes: genetic diversity and dispersal. First, evolution by natural selection requires a diverse set of genes to act upon, but because genetic diversity may change over time, the influence of natural selection may also change. Second, the movement of individuals among habitats may overwhelm the ability of natural selection to purge individuals that are not well-adapted to a particular habitat. The research aims to understand how genetic diversity and dispersal shape the relative roles of contemporary evolution and ecological processes in shaping biodiversity. Results of this study could benefit society by resulting in strategies to conserve biodiversity and improve human health. Additionally, the study will involve a Latina postdoctoral associate, support graduate and undergraduate students at a Hispanic-serving institution, aid development of hands-on activities for K-5 classrooms, and continue an Ask the Scientist blog that pairs scientists with K-12 students in rural areas.<br/><br/>Because studies of the interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes would be difficult and time-consuming to conduct using large plants and animals, this project uses a natural microcosm community as a model system to test hypotheses about genetic diversity and dispersal in the field and laboratory. The leaves of carnivorous pitcher plants contain a diverse assemblage of bacteria, protists, and insects that interact with each other ecologically, but also have very short generation times and rapid evolutionary responses to changing environmental conditions. This project will conduct experiments that create contrasting selection environments that correspond to the conditions in young and old pitcher plant leaves: high predation/low competition versus low predation/high competition, respectively. Each experiment will manipulate either the genetic diversity of protists in the community or the extent of dispersal among local communities. The researchers will then use a novel mathematical approach to distinguish ecological effects on community diversity from evolutionary effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important mathematical problem is to determine the extent to which what is observed determines the shape of an object. More generally - what mathematical features of a shape can one determine from the observables?  The principal investigator will study both concrete and abstract problems of this nature.  For example, suppose a particle is enclosed in a polygon and is traveling in a straight line, bouncing off any side it encounters. The shape of the polygon could be inferred by observing the sequences of sides encountered by the particle. The principal investigator will study the extent to which the shape of the region is determined by these observables. More abstract objects studied in these projects involve algebraic systems probed using ""cross-sectional images"" analogous to those recorded by an MRI. These cross-sectional images can be fit together to completely reconstruct an object.  The principal investigator will develop techniques for predicting certain properties without carrying out the reconstruction.  Using these approaches will also allow one to develop problem solving techniques and methods that could find applications in concrete settings.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will investigate a variety of problems, each of which is connected, either directly or indirectly, to surfaces through geometry, group theory, and dynamics. The research activities are organized into four themes. (1) Studying the large-scale geometry of surface bundles.  The goal is to determine hyperbolicity properties of surface bundles from the geometric data of their associated monodromy representation to the mapping class group.  (2) Probing geometric and dynamical properties of free-by-cyclic groups from the cross section of flows on 2-complexes, and pursuing a fruitful analogy with fundamental groups of surface bundles over the circle. (3) Analyzing singular Euclidean metrics on surfaces and understanding the extent to which the limited data encoded by the support of its associated Liouville current determines the geometry of the metric. This is directly related to studying the extent to which the symbolic dynamics of billiards in polygons determines the shape of the polygon.

The mathematical descriptions will then be expanded to include more detailed and realistic descriptions of interactions among species and underlying environmental changes.  The models will be analyzed to determine both long-term behavior and dynamics.  The mathematical models will then be used to answer important ecological questions focused on how changes in habitat quality and availability and connectivity between different habitats will affect the composition and dynamics of these metacommunities.

The simplest models will focus only on species presence or absence and will be difference equations, so a relatively complete analytical treatment will be possible. Equilibria and their stability can be calculated. The more complex descriptions will all be phrased as integro-difference equations where time is discrete, but the state space is continuous.  The underlying dependent variables will be density functions for the abundance of the species under consideration, and the kernels in the integro-difference equations will describe the underlying ecological dynamics.  Initial analyses will be numerical with the expectation that analytic treatment of conditions for persistence and coexistence will be possible, building on recent mathematical work on integro-difference equations.

If achieved, this would lead to astonishing energy savings, completely transform energy generation, and significantly improve medical imaging technology. So-called superconductors demonstrate this lossless transmission of electricity making them very important for novel technologies. Superconductors also offer the potential for fundamental scientific discovery. The mechanism by which superconductors enable this energy saving phenomenon is largely not well understood. Understanding this mechanism and creating better superconductors is essential for technological application, because currently superconductivity is largely a low-temperature phenomenon, with critical temperatures for superconductors being similar to the extremely low temperatures found on Mars or even in the coldest regions of outer space. Through this award, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry as well as the Condensed Matter Physics programs in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, Freedman's research team engages in a theory-inspired search for new superconductors of a specific type, which could enable fundamental insight into the mechanism of superconductivity. Her team uses high-pressure synthesis to access new compounds that have long eluded chemists. This work enables interdisciplinary training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, where they benefit from the scientific intersection of solid-state chemistry, physics and geophysics. Preparing graduate students to collaborate across fields strengthens the next generation of our scientifically engaged workforce.<br/><br/>Part 2: Technical summary: <br/>The realization of high temperature superconductivity would be a transformative advance, with implications across NSF directorates ranging from improved medical imaging to fault tolerant power transmission. Thus far, the vast majority of new superconductors have been found either by serendipity, modification of known superconducting systems, or through the investigation of theoretically unlikely candidates. In stark contrast, the targeted synthesis of new systems is underdeveloped, owing to the inherent difficulty of predicting new superconducting materials. To enable rational progress, a clear design strategy is needed, which necessitates knowing the operative superconducting mechanism in a given class of superconductors. Freedman proposes the synthesis of the notably missing subclass of Fe-Bi pnictide superconductors via high-pressure synthesis. This work is motivated by Freedman's recent discovery of the first Fe-Bi bond in the solid-state, achieved through the application of high pressure and stabilized by the formation of Bi-Bi interactions. Through this award, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry as well as the Condensed Matter Physics programs in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, Freedman's team characterizes novel materials both through in situ and bulk X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods. Materials are physically probed via magnetometry, resistivity, and heat capacity measurements. The aggregate of these data provides insight into the mechanism of superconductivity, and possible structure-function correlations. Creating and understanding different superconductors offers promise for true discovery within this complex field. The realization of a new class of superconductors would foster collaborations across the sciences and enable a deeper understanding of superconductivity. Superconductors also have tremendous potential for societal impact, ranging from MRI instrumentation to increased power transmission through the electric grid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, community colleges face many challenges, including space and faculty constraints and a large proportion of nontraditional college students who find it difficult to attend on-campus courses. Distance learning through fully online coursework is a promising approach to mitigating these barriers by enabling colleges to offer additional courses or course sections, thus increasing student access to and progression through required courses. This project aims to promote the effectiveness of distance learning in STEM gateway courses at community colleges through evidence-based intervention strategies and practices, with the ultimate goal of supporting improved student engagement and performance.<br/> <br/>The project has five specific objectives: (i) to document typical instructional approaches in online STEM gateway courses offered at community colleges; (ii) to identify promising intervention strategies with the potential to better support student engagement and learning in fully online coursework; iii) to evaluate the impacts of these strategies on student learning outcomes through rigorous randomized controlled trials; (iv) to understand the student experience of learning within online environments through investigation of learning behaviors and the ways in which an intervention strategy may influence these behaviors; and (v) to evaluate which intervention strategies reduce performance gaps in online courses between learners from less and more disadvantaged backgrounds. To achieve these objectives, two core studies will be conducted. The investigator will implement and evaluate two specific intervention strategies that have shown promising results in a four-year setting:  skill scaffolding and increased interpersonal interaction. A descriptive study will systematically collect information on instructors' perceptions of distance learning and their instructional practices in a large swath of online STEM gateway courses in a large state community college system. Subsequently, the investigator will develop additional intervention strategies based on both theoretical recommendations and information collected from the descriptive study.

Learning about this evolution is extremely difficult because the memory of this evolution is in rocks but almost all of them have been recycled in our dynamic Earth. An exception are ocean islands (e.g. Hawaii, Galapagos) that are formed by upwellings (mantle plumes) from the core-mantle boundary and represent material that witnessed surface conditions of the Earth a long time ago. But how long ago? This is generally not yet known. Although the age of a volcanic rock can be measured, the age of the source of a volcanic rock cannot. A recently developed tool to address this question looks at sulfur. The atmosphere changed about 2.45 billion years ago when oxygen increased dramatically, the so-called Great Oxygenation Event. The composition of sulfur in contact with the atmosphere before and after this 2.45 billion year mark are very different. Thus it can be determined if sulfur was on the surface of Earth before or after 2.45 billion years ago. Previous studies have found that sulfur from the surface of Earth more than 2.45 billion years ago traveled to the core-mantle boundary some 3000 km deep and back up where it was carried in magmas to the surface. This is an excellent example how the surface of our planet shapes its interior all the way down to the core. In this project sulfur will be used for the first time to investigate one of the major plume systems that have formed flood basalts covering most of Brazil about 130 Ma ago followed by lines of volcanoes marking the passage of the plates over a stationary mantle plume. This project will constrain the age of the source of this major plume system to younger or older than 2.45 billion years. It will also help our understanding how volumetrically significant material older than 2.45 billion year-old material is in the formation of mantle plumes. It has surprised researchers that mantle plume sources can be so old. It is exciting to look at a volcanic eruption and know that what forms lava today had been at the surface of Earth when no higher life forms yet existed, traveled all the way to the core-mantle boundary, and came back up over more than half of Earth's history. <br/><br/>The persistence of recycled surface sulfur through subduction and eventual rise in a mantle plume has been demonstrated for two smaller South Pacific plumes (Pitcairn and Mangaia island of Cook-Austral) with basalts including sulfur older than about 2.45 Ga. However, to this point it is not clear whether such old surface material is a common or rare component in plume sources. In this project for the first time sulfur isotopes are measured in rocks related to a major long-lived plume system, the Tristan-Gough plume system in the South Atlantic, with an initial flood basalt province, the Parana, and with a root at the core-mantle boundary related to the African large low shear wave velocity province. This project addresses the following major hypothesis through a detailed analyses of sulfide inclusions in volcanic rocks from Tristan and Gough island: 1. Is the recycled component in the Tristan-Gough plume of Archean age or younger? Previous work showed that the Gough signature persists since at least 100 Ma, thus an Archean age would indicate that a significant volume of a major plume source contains old recycled surface material. 2. How does the absence or presence of Archean sulfur relate to the global endmembers of oceanic basalts in Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopic compositions? Pitcairn and Tristan-Gough both have enriched mantle 1 endmember compositions. Do sulfur isotopes support formation by similar geochemical fractionation events of similar age, or, do different evolution paths lead to similar compositions? 3. What do sulfur isotopes imply regarding contributions from atmospheric, deep ocean hydrothermal or even microbial sediment components?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Striking this balance requires a clear understanding of the human-induced changes in freshwater flows and storages, agricultural systems, and ecosystem services, as well as the complex interactions and feedback among coupled natural and human systems. The goal of this project is to advance the research and education of water resource sustainability in managed land-water systems by using a novel numerical modeling framework and a wealth of data from ground and satellite observations, climate models, and socio-economic analysis. The framework, which comprises of a suite of hydrological, agricultural, and ecological models, is used to identify ways to optimize the use of land and water resources by systematically examining the trade-offs between upstream basin management for food-energy production (e.g., hydropower, irrigation) and downstream changes in river-floodplain dynamics and groundwater systems (e.g., reduction in sediment load, seawater intrusion). The project will provide new insights about ways to best utilize the information on global change and practices for local-regional water management through its integration into coupled hydrological-agricultural-ecological models to develop adaptation strategies for sustainable water resource management as well as achieving water and food security. The research project integrates a substantive set of educational initiatives for promoting knowledge about hydrology and water resources among high school and community college students, motivating them to pursue STEM education and inspiring them to study freshwater systems toward addressing pressing societal challenges regarding food, energy, and water security. The educational component involves an interactive web-based version of the modeling system for classroom use in undergraduate and graduate teaching, for educating high school and community college students, and as resource for teachers especially in community colleges. The education program also includes mentored international research and training through online initiatives. <br/><br/>The modeling framework is based on the Community Land Model (CLM) but includes critical enhancements made by incorporating advanced schemes representing crop growth, irrigation, groundwater pumping, and river-floodplain-reservoir routing. The strength of this novel framework lies in its ability to explicitly resolve the coupled behavior of a range of natural hydrologic and biophysical processes (e.g., surface hydrology, groundwater dynamics, sediment transport, land use change, and crop growth), human land-water management practices (irrigation, reservoir operation, groundwater pumping), and ecological processes (seawater intrusion, floodplain-wetland dynamics). The framework is designed to simulate large-scale water cycle dynamics at regional to continental scales while also mechanistically resolving fine-scale, topography-driven hydrologic-groundwater processes such as lateral groundwater flow and river-floodplain-groundwater interactions. Thus, the study will significantly advance our capability to simulate coupled surface water, groundwater, and agricultural systems, which is critical for achieving food security through better assessment and prediction of water resource. Since CLM is a land component of an Earth System Model (ESM), the new framework and insights gained from the study are expected to inform the development of the next generation of ESMs through the incorporation of human components for the holistic study of coupled natural-human systems, and to assess human-climate interactions. The new framework will also enable us to better assess and predict water resources in highly managed land-water system around the world including the High Plains in the central US and Central Valley in California where declining water supplies are likely to adversely impact regional, national, and global food security in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most obvious is a physical membrane, such as the cell membrane that separates the cytoplasm from its surrounding environment or the nuclear membrane that confines chromosomal DNA within the nucleus. Mechanisms for compartmentalization are essential as they override diffusive smoothing of concentration gradients that would otherwise homogenize cellular contents and fail to allow spatial regulation of critical cellular processes. A recently identified and current intense focus in cell biology is on chemical compartments that form in the absence of physical membranes.  This project focuses on a specific example: the binding of cytoplasmic proteins and RNAs into complexes that form protein-rich droplets by way of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). By bringing together mathematical, computational, and biological scientists, the investigators aim to develop a general computational modeling platform to study cytoplasmic droplets and their spatial distributions that arise from LLPS.  The aim is to understand mechanistically how these compartments establish and preserve cytoplasmic heterogeneity in mRNA localization and expression in live cells, and the molecular species, complexes, and kinetic timescales that are responsible. By applications of this platform to other live cells, there is the potential to understand the essential cell-specific molecular ingredients and chemical kinetics for LLPS, thereby contributing to understanding of the diversity of intracellular compartmentalization across cell biology. <br/><br/>There is a rich history in cell biology of the study of membranes and their role in establishing extracellular and intracellular chemical compartments. Yet, relatively little is known about how molecular proteins, organelles, and chromosomal DNA, within the cytoplasm or within the nucleus, chemically interact and self-organize to create, sustain, and evolve localized chemical and macromolecular compartments in the absence of physical membranes. Armed with resolved spatial and temporal experimental data of primary molecular species and species complexes, the investigators in this project focus on three specific aims.  1. A computational modeling platform to explore the input space of primary molecular (proteins, RNAs, protein-RNA complexes) and microscopic (nuclei, membranes) species, chemical species affinities, and spatial confinement conditions.  This platform will produce a phase diagram of outcomes that mimics live cell data (dynamic self-organization of complexes and molecular species, droplet formation due to liquid-liquid phase separation), and that reveals sufficient ingredients and interactions for membrane-less, intracellular chemical compartments, and their robustness. 2.  By way of coupled stochastic and continuum modeling, conditioning on ex vivo and in vivo experimental data, to discover sufficient molecular species, complexes, and hidden chemical affinities that reproduce the chemical compartmentalization of live cells. 3. To extend numerical tools for multiphase modeling to accommodate strong fluctuations and out-of-equilibrium behavior driven by chemical kinetics, viscoelasticity of droplets, and induced flow by liquid-liquid phase separation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems typically include a subset of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs as compute engines and hence, present unique programming/resource management challenges. However, the lack of required compiler and runtime support, present a barrier to the widespread adoption of heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, the design of the underlying heterogeneous architecture in terms of number and placement of various compute engines, memory subsystems and interconnects for a given area/power budget to satiate various application demands, is not fully explored. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the entire system stack in a cohesive manner spanning applications, system software and underlying hardware for providing the required support for efficient application executions.  Thus, the main goal of this research project is to enable dynamic mapping of an application to different computing engines for improving performance/power efficiency and system utilization. The outcomes of this project are poised to change the way the programmers and users perceive heterogeneity and interact with it. The research on heterogeneous computing will be integrated with the educational activities and student training at Penn State for nurturing the future workforce in science and engineering, with active participation of female graduate students and undergraduates (Honors) students. <br/> <br/>The project consists four tasks.

On the one hand, the PI will investigate the behavior of waves in space, as they interact nonlinearly with themselves and matter over large space-time scales. The ultimate goal is to explain how the  energy, which is stored in a wave undergoing a nonlinear dynamical evolution, ultimately  splits  into  quantized pieces and a wave ""at the horizon"". The latter refers to energy, possibly of large size, which  is infinitely spread out and does not interact with anything in a noticeable fashion. In contrast with this macroscopic behavior, the project also aims at understanding the behavior of waves on the microscopic scale, such as in crystals or quasi-crystals. The goal is to explain  transitions from an insulating state to that of a conductor, which these materials may exhibit as they undergo changes on the molecular level. Such changes may occur  through the insertion of impurities, or changes in the environment. Both the macroscopic as well as the microscopic behavior of waves is of crucial importance to science and engineering, and profoundly affects our daily modern lives. Modern communication relies on waves transmitted over large distances both in space but also along glass fiber cables. For the latter the properties of the material are crucial and both nonlinear effects as well as aforementioned microscopic phenomena decide the suitability  of the underlying medium. <br/><br/>More technically speaking, the PI intends to further investigate the rigorous mathematical theory of focusing dispersive semilinear evolution equations. A major open problem is to analyze  the resolution of any solution into moving solitons and radiation. Some success has been achieved in recent years on this important problem, but for nonintegrable equations we are far from a satisfactory understanding. The PI is currently involved in the study of this problem in the dissipative setting in which some damping is added to the equation. The Hamiltonian setting appears to be very difficult at the moment, especially in the subcritical regime. The methods involved derive from dynamical systems, invariant manifold theory, and dispersive PDEs. The quantum mechanical problems alluded in the previous paragraph belong to the area of Anderson localization. Together with his long-standing collaborator Michael Goldstein at Toronto, but also with young collaborators which are joining the field, the PI intends to bring the body of techniques which were developed over the past 20 years  based on large deviation estimates, the avalanche principle, semi-algebraic sets, and harmonic analysis such as (pluri)subharmonic functions and the Cartan estimate, to bear on both linear and nonlinear problems in dynamical systems and spectral theory.

The infected plant or animal is called a ""host"" and the infecting organism is called a ""pathogen"".  The interaction between hosts and pathogens is important to understand because it often determines one's health. Scientists are now becoming aware that the host-pathogen interaction is more complicated because one host can be infected by many pathogens, all of whom interact with each other as well as with the host.  Likewise, one type of pathogen can infect several types of hosts, and how one host responds can influence whether another host becomes infected.  Figuring out how all this plays out in Nature requires carefully designed experiments and mathematical models and this project provides both.  Developing a deeper understanding of hosts and pathogens is critical because humans are dramatically altering the biological world, introducing new types of hosts and pathogens in some areas and removing them from others. Understanding how such gains and losses of organisms influences the spread of disease is important to the fields of conservation science and public health. This research program will train undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in the fields of disease ecology and mathematical biology, and will engage the public through a variety of outreach activities. <br/><br/>Humans are impacting biodiversity patterns globally and these changes can influence the risk and prevalence of infectious diseases. The goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic multi-host multi-pathogen epidemiological theory that explains how between-host and between-pathogen competition jointly shape disease dynamics.  To determine how competition alters the amplification or dilution of diseases, mathematical models will be developed and tested using planktonic species and their associated pathogens via laboratory based mesocosm and field experiments. This work will both extend current theory on multi-host and multi-pathogen communities as well as unify theory developed independently for diseases with different transmission modes.

The reason is that the HPC storage system often is the Achilles Heel of HPC systems, as it is fraught with numerous scenarios for contention, congestion and performance variability. This problem is getting worse due to: (a) the increased importance of data-driven HPC and the growth in the amount of data generated by large-scale simulation; and (b) the slower growth of disk speed, as compared to CPU speed. The addition of high-bandwidth persistent memory devices as burst-buffers brings in new opportunities for fast caching of application data while still allowing data persistence. However, the conventional approach of exploiting burst-buffers as yet another caching layer cannot reduce the lengthy and costly data processing steps in the deep I/O stack or reconcile occasional contentions inside the complex storage system. This project, therefore, seeks to exploit burst-buffers as repositories of persistent application-specific parallel file systems, with a lifetime commensurate to the lifetime of an application or an application campaign on a HPC system. This is a collaborative project between University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Florida State University. <br/><br/>This project formulates a research framework called Ephemeral Coherence Cohort (ECC) that offers an abstraction to represent the active collection of application data through containerization, insulate I/O activities across different applications, and enable storage disaggregation for ephemeral allocation and dynamic utilization of burst buffers.

Similarly, liquid crystal ordering is important in contexts ranging from biological membranes to displays in consumer devices. In every pixel of a liquid crystal display, the direction of rod-like molecules is rotated by a low-voltage electric field, so that the transmitted light can be controlled to convey information at will. This facile electric switching, which is at the heart of $500 billion per year global liquid crystal industry, deals with very simple uniform and continuously distorted structures of the molecular alignment field of rod-like molecules. The PI and his team study how liquid crystals can be controlled to host knotted patterns of this molecular alignment field. They study tiny rod-like and disc-like colloidal particles dispersed in a liquid crystal to develop a ""recipe book"" for organizing particles into precisely controlled structures. Electric and magnetic fields can interact with these structures, knotting or unknotting them, which may enrich the means of controlling light by liquid crystals. This research may lead to applications of importance to society, such as new breeds of displays, beam steering and data storage devices. PI combines this research with a broad range of synergistic educational and outreach activities, including shows and science tours for school teachers and students, advising student chapters of professional societies, providing research experiences for students from minority-serving institutions, advising undergraduate and PhD researchers, teaching conference courses for liquid crystal industry, participation in visiting lecturer programs and organization of conferences and summer schools.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>PI explores the fundamental organizing principles behind topology-dictated self-assembly of anisotropic liquid crystal molecules and colloidal nanoparticles into topologically distinct soliton configurations that are thousands-to-millions times larger than molecules and nanoparticles. Widely studied magnetic skyrmions are 2D solitons with a spatially localized topology-protected continuous winding of magnetization. 3D skyrmions (hopfions) are localized in all three spatial dimensions and characterized by the Hopf index, a topological invariant with a geometric interpretation of the linking number of any two closed-loop preimages, regions in space with the same orientation of field corresponding to a single point on the order parameter space, such as a unit sphere for the magnetization vector field. PI develops a new breed of tunable liquid crystal structures with complex but predictable topology-dictated response to external fields and propagating optical solitons and vortices of laser beams. Both equilibrium self-assembly and dynamic interactions between 2D and 3D solitons are controlled and probed using a combination of laser tweezers, 3D nonlinear optical imaging, and video microscopy. This interdisciplinary work addresses key problems at the interfaces of condensed matter physics, topology, nanoscience and photonics. The emerging scientific frontiers at the nexus of these fields show exceptional promise of new discovery and applications. This work advances our fundamental knowledge of structure and dynamics of 3D topological solitons, expands the diversity of self-assembly phenomena in complex fluids and impinges on fundamental knowledge in scientific fields as diverse as colloidal interactions, topology, nonlinear and singular optics, all optical information processing, and other. In addition to serving as a model system for fundamental studies, potential technological uses of the studied solitons include beam steering devices, generators of optical vortices for singular optics applications, optical circuitry with robust capabilities of controlling polarization of light, and topologically nontrivial solitons with knotted field configurations forming crystalline and other lattices in materials.

One main emphasis of her research is on high-dimensional objects and phenomena. This leads to applications of her research in areas as diverse as physics, biology and medicine, computer science, optimization and economics and material science: Indeed, a mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high dimension.  For example, specifying the location, direction and speed of one gas molecule in a room six separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room, then you will need 600 independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements.  As these dimensions increase then the difficulty of sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon data scientists sometimes call ""the curse of dimensionality.""  However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension increases which are not visible in low dimensions.  We can exploit those patterns, thus converting the ""curse of dimensionality"" into ""blessing of dimensionality"".  It is one purpose of this award to study such high-dimensional phenomena.<br/> <br/>Important features of this project are the study of high-dimensional objects and phenomena and their links with other areas of mathematics and mathematical sciences, such as probability, statistics and information theory.  Of particular interest are the affine invariant functionals on convex bodies in high dimensions. Among the most important such functionals are affine surface area and the p-affine surface area (a family of functionals parametrized by a real number p). Their corresponding affine isoperimetric inequalities, established by the PI and collaborators for all p, are stronger than their Euclidean counterparts and related to the famous Mahler conjecture which is still open in dimensions four and higher.  It was shown by the principal investigator that p-affine surface areas are directly related to entropies of cone measures of convex bodies which establishes a link between convex geometry and information theory. This link will be further explored, also in the context of log concave functions which are a natural extension of convex bodies in the realm of functions.  Moreover, affine surface area appears naturally in questions on approximation of convex bodies by polytopes, a further main topic of study.  The goal is to establish optimal dependence on all the relevant parameters involved in the approximation, for example the dimension and the number of vertices of the approximating polytopes. The principal investigator and her collaborators also extended the notions of affine surface area recently to a functional setting and to spherical and hyperbolic space. To establish the corresponding inequalities in those settings is a further topic of study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This requires retention and processing of a large amount of information such as maps and verbal instructions. An apparent gap between the enormous information processing needs during a mission and the limited processing capacity of people creates a potentially fatal situation in emergency wayfinding. This project will contribute to the NSF's Big Idea ""Harnessing Data for 21st Century Science and Engineering"" by conducting fundamental research in information processing and engineering in the field of disaster management. This project will test the theoretical foundation of personalized wayfinding information systems that can effectively minimize the cognitive load of first responders on the individual level. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve emergency response wayfinding, which will save lives and potentially reduce economic losses during disasters. <br/><br/>This project has three interdependent scientific objectives. First, the research quantifies the structured relationship between spatial information and different forms of cognitive load in wayfinding tasks. Spatial information for wayfinding will be categorized and measured using semantic metrics; then a quantitative model of the relationship between spatial information and cognitive load will be examined. Second, the research explores cognitive resilience that helps identify and prevent an abrupt drop in wayfinding performance. Virtual Reality (VR) based multi-mission experiments are performed to examine the hypothetical nonlinearity of the relationship between cognitive load and wayfinding performance. Third, the research evaluates the effectiveness of personalized wayfinding information system in simulated mission tasks. A holistic VR experiment is performed to compare the new personalized system against the current universal spatial information systems. The outcome of the scientific investigation includes an adaptive wayfinding information system that dynamically tailors the way spatial information is presented based on the real-time cognitive load of individual first responders, measured by a set of neurobiological and physiological metrics. The project will immediately impact first responders primarily firefighters for their missions.  A number of collaborative outreach activities are planned between two project sites: Texas A&M University and Northeastern University. These include advancing VR technologies for STEM education, integrating the research outcomes to curriculum development at both institutions, and developing a free online course and open-source project for general public access.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Capacity-expansion problems are large-scale and complex, due to the nature of power systems (spanning continents and including thousands of nodes and branches) and the numerous uncertainties plaguing long-term planning decisions. This includes large-scale uncertainties, such as long-term demand growth, changes in fuel prices, energy-policy choices, and technology development; and small-scale uncertainties, such as weather events affecting real-time demand and wind and solar availability. This project will develop modeling paradigms that capture the multiple scales of planning decisions and the uncertainties that affect them within a coherent framework. This is a timely and fundamentally important endeavor to ensure an efficient transition to more sustainable and resilient power system designs. <br/><br/>We will tackle this challenging problem by developing two complementary approaches to modeling power system capacity expansion. Both approaches model multi-scale uncertainties and decisions and represent system operations in sufficient detail to capture system flexibility needs. The first approach uses a multi-stage stochastic optimization approach, in which investment decisions are made at coarse (e.g., decadal) timescales and operating decisions are made at fine (e.g., hourly) timescales, with full representation of the temporal sequence of these decisions. Large-scale uncertainties are modeled explicitly in the scenario tree, while small-scale uncertainties are captured through different operating conditions. The other approach is an adaptive robust stochastic model, in which planning decisions are made to be robust or distributionally robust to large-scale uncertainties and take stochastic operating conditions into account. These complex and large-scale models are accompanied by decomposition algorithms. The progressive hedging algorithm will be adapted to tractably solve the multi-stage stochastic optimization model while column-and-constraint algorithms will be developed for solving the robust model. We will also explore the use of clustering and importance sampling techniques to select representative operating periods to be modeled between investment epochs. The use, tractability, and power of the proposed modeling techniques will be demonstrated using large-scale case studies based on North American power systems. The PIs will also engage with electricity industry members. They will also use industry- and government-advisory positions to advance industry dissemination. These steps will ensure that the results of the research are used by industry members while at the same time industry can provide vital feedback and input to model and case study development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Group actions arise naturally in many areas of mathematics. For instance, group actions describe the possible symmetries of a regular polygon or, more generally, the ways to cut a polygon into pieces and reassemble into the original polygon.  The research project will apply tools from the theory of dynamical systems in order to study more general group actions on spaces.  The goal of these projects is to establish certain rigidity results showing that all actions or invariant objects are of a certain prototypical form.

Many of these cofactors are built from vitamins and minerals that are important in the diet. One such cofactor is the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which allows proteins to perform many important types of chemistry. Because free Fe and S are toxic to cells, elaborate protein systems are used to build these cofactors. Once they are built, the Fe-S clusters must be trafficked to, and inserted into, proteins that require them. Cells that cannot properly build Fe-S clusters or maturate Fe-S proteins have chronic complications, which often results in cell death. The nature of this cellular machinery, however, is not well understood, and many questions remain about how organisms build Fe-S clusters and deliver them to proteins that require them for function. Novel Fe-S protein maturation proteins continue to be discovered, highlighting the fact that a global understanding of this process is lacking. The studies to be conducted in this project will impact the understanding of iron-dependent processes from bacteria to humans. The project will also provide unique educational opportunities for two postdoctoral scholars and up to ten undergraduate students. These trainees will be technically and intellectually trained and will receive the necessary guidance and resources to aid their transition into the next phases of their careers. The trainees will focus on enhancing their communication skills, technical skills, teaching skills, and personnel management skills.<br/><br/>The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis utilizes the SufCDSUB Fe-S cluster biosynthetic system and at least two Fe-S cluster carriers. Additional factors have been identified that have roles in Fe-S protein maturation, including SufT and YlaN; however, the functions of these molecules are unknown. Moreover, the Fe and electron donors for Suf-directed Fe-S cluster synthesis, as well as additional carrier molecules, are unknown. To properly understand how Fe-S proteins are maturated, the components involved must be identified and their functions defined. This project combines classic genetics and biochemistry with state-of-the-art, next-generation technologies and computational biology to 1) determine the physical interactions between SufT, YlaN, and Fe-S cluster synthesis, assembly, and target proteins, 2) quantify the necessity of SufT and alternate Fe-S cluster assembly factors for the function of specific metabolic pathways that require Fe-S enzymes, 3) assign biochemical functions to SufT and YlaN, and 4) model and predict the effect of faulty Fe-S protein maturation and validate the effects in vivo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, the team will evaluate how flow regime modifies the ecosystem health status of urban watersheds (Objective 3). Findings from these objectives will be integrated to predict environmental outcomes from stormwater management strategies through a Bayesian network model linking decision-making to environmental outcomes (Objective 4). This study presents an integrative framework to empirically establish the cascading effects of decisions on stormwater management actions and environmental outcomes, both within and across regions. New scientific insight into stormwater management for urban aquatic ecosystem health is targeted to inform future directions of stormwater programs in US urban areas.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Richard N. Aslin at Haskins Laboratories and Dr. Janet F. Werker at University of British Columbia, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist, investigating how early bilingual experiences shape the mind and brain during infancy. Recent years have featured a sudden increase in global migration and growth of multilingual communities. Language acquisition is the greatest predictor of success in school and later life. The research proposed here aims to examine how early bilingual experiences impact language outcomes, early cognition and brain development. The findings (1) will advance our understanding of how being raised bilingual prepares an infant for later learning, (2) could ultimately inform educational practices for young learners as well as policy practices that revolve around language resources and needs, and (3) aid in the design of effective educational pedagogies for linguistically diverse families.<br/><br/>Cognitive and neural development arises partly from everyday learning experiences, including language acquisition. Infants acquire language effortlessly, yet bilingual babies must learn twice as many words. To successfully acquire their languages, bilingual babies must differentiate each language, track its features, and keep these representations separate. However, the doubling of linguistic contexts may impose an increased demand on attentional mechanisms that support bilinguals' management of their languages. Thus, some suggest that a bilingual environment should heighten and improve attentional control mechanisms (i.e., the ability to focus selectively and cast out unnecessary information). One way to examine how early bilingual experiences impact cognition is by establishing the developmental nature of these changes, while infants are beginning to distinguish their languages and whether this experience alters the plasticity of brain networks and consequently behavior. The present project examines whether managing two languages during infancy alters attentional mechanisms, and supports language outcomes. It is hypothesized that as bilingual infants gain proficiency at distinguishing their languages, their brain responses and behavior for attentional control will also show different developmental patterns than monolingual infants. Ninety infants will participate in a session at 6- and 9-months. Infants will include 30 monolingual English learning, 30 bilingual English-Chinese learning, and 30 bilingual English-other language learning. Parents will complete questionnaires on their child's language experiences, vocabulary knowledge, and a behavioral report on attentional control; these forms will also be mailed to parents when children are 12-, 18- and 24-months old. The study will use functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain activity, and eye-tracking technology to measure infants' performance. Infants will sit on their parents' lap while completing a visuo-spatial attentional control task and a language-discrimination task. The study's methodology is innovative, as it incorporates neuroimaging and eye-tracking techniques simultaneously, as part of a longitudinal brain-behavior approach with young infants. Thus, it will introduce innovative methods linking neuroimaging and behavioral data to better characterize infant capabilities. More broadly, this work will inform developmental theories on how early life experiences, such as bilingualism, impact early cognition and brain plasticity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, many large-scale datasets, such as internet search logs, network traffic, and sensor network data, have been studied in data-stream literature. Surprisingly, a number of fast procedures used in numerical linear algebra have been made possible by exploiting tools that were originally developed in the data-stream literature. These developments are based on a technique called sketching, which is a tool for quickly compressing a problem to a smaller version of itself, for which one can then afford to run a much slower procedure on the smaller problem. A major goal of this project is to study foundational problems in the data-stream domain, and develop their connections to problems in numerical linear algebra. The algorithms developed here will be accessible to graduate and undergraduate students from computer science, machine learning, and mathematics, and the investigator plans to integrate the results of the project into a graduate course on algorithms for big data, as well as undergraduate algorithms courses. The investigator is actively working with underrepresented minority and undergraduate researchers on topics directly related to this project.<br/><br/>The first main thrust of this project is to develop new techniques for fundamental problems in data streams where the goal is to use minimal amount of memory while running algorithms over one pass on a data stream. Such problems include statistical problems - such as estimating the variance, moments, most frequent items, heavy hitters - for many of which optimal memory bounds are still unknown. Another challenge in this domain is that of processing massive streams for real-world graphs, such as geometric intersection graphs, which arise in cellular networks and scheduling theory. By studying a breadth of problems in different corners of data streams, the investigator plans to develop new techniques and build unexpected applications. The second main thrust of the project is to develop new algorithms and hardness results for fundamental problems in numerical linear algebra, connecting such problems to the study of data streams. CountSketch, which is a low-memory heavy hitters algorithm, paved the way for obtaining time-optimal algorithms for regression. This project will continue to push forward such connections, for example, by studying CountSketch in the context of tensors, which is a new application domain. The project will also investigate many deterministic (instead of randomized) data stream algorithms, and understanding their role in linear algebra. A major goal is to understand the limitations of speedups to linear algebra problems. One particular problem of interest here is to obtain low rank approximation with spectral norms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AoI is clearly connected to many aspects of Information Theory, Signal Processing, and multiple applications. However, the fundamental nature of this concept has been elusive so far. This project will investigate all three aspects of the AoI, namely its significance as a performance metric, its usefulness as a tool, and, more importantly, its potential to explore profound aspects of, and fundamental interconnections among, the theories that underlie our understanding of information structure, causal information processing, and the context (or semanteme) of information. Especially in the latter, the context of the communication process is emerging as a well-defined and useful extension of the Shannon doctrine of communication. Namely, communication needs not be just reproducing at point B a message selected at point A. Rather, it is important to consider whether communication occurs for a purpose, such as for computation, prediction, or monitoring. Educational efforts will include course development at both undergraduate and graduate levels. The investigators will also strengthen the strong programs of their Institutions in recruiting women and under-represented minorities, as well as the involvement of undergraduate students in research.<br/><br/>The proposed work aims at using the new concept of Age of Information to discover the relationships between Information Theory and Signal Processing, which are two of the main pillars of Information Science.

In addition to the basic importance of studying communication as a bottleneck resource, the theory has found a vast number of applications in many areas, including machine learning, mechanism design, streaming algorithms, data structures, pseudo-random generators, and VLSI layouts. This project tackles fundamental questions whose resolution will have a significant impact on the discipline. This work will exploit insights from, and contribute new ideas to, other areas such as quantum computing, computational learning, and approximation theory. The project is an ample source of research problems at various levels of difficulty and will be used in advising graduate and undergraduate students.  The investigator will integrate this research into his graduate and undergraduate teaching, take an active part in scientific dissemination, and promote theoretical computer science in Southern California.<br/><br/>This project comprises two related components.  First, the investigator will tackle longstanding open problems in the study of multiparty communication, such as settling the communication requirements of the set disjointness problem and breaking the logarithmic barrier for multiparty communication lower bounds. The second, complementary component of this project will advance the study of analytic representations of Boolean functions. Here, the investigator aims to obtain tight lower bounds for the polynomial approximation and sign-representation of the k-element distinctness function, constant-depth circuits, and Boolean formulas of arbitrary depth.  The two research components of this project are intimately related in that they require the same class of analytic techniques. Indeed, major advances in communication complexity over the past two decades have been obtained by transforming, explicitly or implicitly, communication protocols into multivariate polynomials of comparable complexity and by analyzing the resulting approximation questions. The planned research on multiparty communication and polynomials is further unified by a focus on noise, in the sense of imperfect output or adversarial corruption of intermediate computations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This opens the possibility that it can also be used to power medical implants such as cardiac pacemakers and neural stimulators. Capacitive devices, like microphones, are widely used for sound to electrical signal conversion but they are deemed unsuitable for implants as they require batteries to charge them. In this research, parametric effect, like a child pumping a swing by periodically standing and squatting to increase the size of the swing's oscillations, is investigated to remove this limitation. It turns out that one move a plate of a capacitor using sound waves or mechanical input over a certain threshold level to start this type of oscillation in an electrical circuit without a need for a battery. Initial analysis shows that this energy conversion can be very efficient, leading to remotely powering medical devices with ultrasound, and this oscillation can be started potentially with very small input levels, leading to very sensitive mechanical sensors to be used for energy harvesting, seismic or underwater sensing. In this project, these possibilities and fundamental limits of this unique approach will be explored experimentally and through detailed models.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to test a radically different approach to acoustic power transfer and sensing through the use of electrical parametric oscillators (resonators) driven by acoustic waves. In addition to optimized power transfer efficiency, the parametric amplification and noise squeezing for acoustic sensing applications will be explored by analyzing the fundamental mathematical problem of coupled oscillator based parametric systems and parametric super-resonance. Both analytical and numerical analysis methods will be utilized. This project will generate the proof of concept data for demonstration of efficient power transfer and model verification to develop new type of devices through ultrasound experiments in 500kHz-2MHz range. Use of inductance and resistance modulation for parametric resonance will be explored. If successful, this project, by exploiting nonlinearity and resonance, can lead to a paradigm shift in acoustic transduction which heretofore depended predominantly on linear, passive properties of capacitive and piezoelectric devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies in the well-established model organism, social amoeba Dictyostelium, have demonstrated that directed movement is orchestrated by a vast network of molecular pathways that are activated in response to the chemical or mechanical signals. Similar molecular pathways have also been observed in mammalian cells that utilize amoeboid-type movement, such as white blood cells and metastatic tumor cells. To better understand the molecular networks controlling cell to surface attachment in directed cell movement of amoeboid cells, this research will examine interactions between known regulators of cell attachment,identify new players in the process, and explore the role of mechanical forces and their transmission to the molecular network in directed movement in Dictyostelium cells. This research will provide training opportunities for many undergraduate students performing primary research either in the investigator's laboratory, or in a course-based setting, as well as high school students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. Students will gain hands-on experience in current techniques in molecular and cell biology and biochemistry, and will develop valuable critical thinking and scientific reasoning skills. To further promote higher education in STEM-related fields in the upcoming generation, this program also includes hosting visits of preschool and high school students to SUNY Oswego, where they can directly interact with and learn from the students conducting primary research.<br/><br/>Chemotaxis, or migration in a chemoattractant gradient, is the best understood mode of directed cell migration, and involves activation of multiple signal transduction pathways downstream of a chemoattractant receptor, leading to biased actin polymerization. In contrast to chemotaxis, detailed mechanisms of shear flow-induced migration are not known. Furthermore, the role of cell-substrate adhesion during directed cell migration in cells that utilize amoeboid-type migration is unclear. The hypothesis of this study is that in addition to its involvement in overall directed migration, cell-substrate adhesion plays a unique role in the initiation of and directional sensing during shear flow-induced migration. Using an established model system for amoeboid-type motility, Dictyostelium discoideum, this research will investigate the interplay between adhesion and directed cell migration in two ways. First, this study will test the genetic and molecular interaction between Rap1/Phg2, a known pathway that controls adhesion in Dictyostelium, and a new regulator of adhesion and chemotaxis, KrsB. A suppressor screen will also be conducted in a course-based setting to identify potentially novel KrsB partners. Second, this project will examine the effects of various perturbations in cell substrate adhesion and its coupling to the actin cytoskeleton on the initial response to shear flow. Taken together, this study will greatly expand the understanding of the signal transduction events involved in non-integrin based adhesion and its role in directed cell migration to various cues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wave turbulence is manifested in many physical systems, including familiar water waves, water surface gravity and capillary waves, and a great variety of waves in plasmas (in particular, in fusion devices). A Bose-Einstein condensate is a state of matter that was first predicted theoretically in 1924 and produced experimentally in 1995. While quantum phenomena are exhibited on micro-scales, and nature is well described on macro-scales by classical mechanics, for a Bose-Einstein condensate macroscopic quantum phenomena become apparent. The quantum kinetic theory that describes some physical properties of this state of matter is the second subject of this research. Although wave turbulence and quantum kinetics are dramatically different as physical phenomena, their mathematical description uses similar equations. Despite the widespread applications of these kinetic equations, little is known rigorously in this field. The aim of the project is to develop mathematical techniques and apply them to concrete physical situations, leading to a more profound understanding of both wave turbulence and quantum kinetics.<br/><br/>The project is aimed at developing the theory of the existence, uniqueness, finite-time condensation, and relaxation to equilibrium for strong solutions of the kinetic equations. The principal investigator will address the local-in-time existence via techniques of harmonic analysis and novel Strichartz-type estimates. For important questions related to 3-wave wave turbulence, regularity theory for the kinetic equation with a particular broadening (regularization) of the resonance set will be used.

Algebraic geometry studies geometric objects called varieties, created by equations that are built from addition and multiplication. Symplectic geometry involves geometric objects related to classical mechanics. We are interested in `topological' properties of some of these varieties such as how many `holes' they have and `enumerative' properties such as the number of curves they contain. The PI is interested in pairs of varieties which are birational to each other, which means that they become identical after removing smaller varieties. We wish to know what topological or enumerative properties they have in common. One of the main aims of this project is to see how tools from symplectic geometry can be used to investigate such issues. The PI believes these ideas are new and can be used to explore other areas of algebraic and symplectic geometry using this different perspective. The PI will help out with a program involving high school students called Seawolf math, and will also help out with a math summer camp for high school students at Stony Brook. The PI will also help out in workshops designed for graduate students learning closely related fields of study.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to understand the relationship between birational geometry and certain Floer theoretic invariants.  These invariants include symplectic/contact cohomology, Floer cohomology of a symplectomorphism and the Fukaya category. The PI will use these Floer invariants to prove certain statements related to birational geometry.  One of the main goals of this NSF funded project is to give a completely new approach to the crepant resolution conjecture using an extended version of symplectic cohomology. The PI will prove a weak version of this conjecture using these methods. The PI believes these methods point to certain generalizations of this conjecture. The PI will study terminal 3-fold singularities and also Newton non-degenerate singularities using Floer theory. Studying such singularities could lead to new insights just as studying quotient singularities led the PI to study the crepant resolution conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The dynamical instabilities responsible for the onset and ensuing propagation of these events are linked to fundamental physics- friction, fracture, heating, and compaction- of fluid filled granular materials and rocks in the subsurface subjected to extreme geophysical conditions. Events like Tohoku and Chi-Chi earthquakes have conclusively shown that seismic hazard critically depends on the underlying fault physics including spatial heterogeneity in hydraulic properties and pore pressure generation. Advancing frontiers in micromechanical modeling of deformation and failure in fluid infiltrated geological materials and computational modeling of earthquake ruptures in heterogeneous fault zones under realistic conditions are  the objective of this study. This provides a pathway for predictive modeling of these critical phenomena and development of better-informed seismic hazard models. Blending perspectives from nonlinear mechanics, statistical physics, numerical methods, and seismology provides a wide range of scientific and educational opportunities, with impact on natural hazards policy and preparedness as well as technical training of the future workforce. Central to this project is building bridges between the geophysics and mechanics communities using a set of well-coordinated activities including workshops, conferences, and social media platforms which will lead to cross-pollination of ideas and nurturing a new class of scientists and engineers with strong interdisciplinary training. Professional mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, especially from under represented communities is a critical component of the proposed educational plan. <br/><br/>The objective of this CAREER project is to develop a plan to advance frontiers in earthquake source physics using an interdisciplinary research and an interdisciplinary educational approach. Despite the potentially dominating rule of pore fluid pressure variations in earthquake source nucleation and propagation, the multiscale mechanics of fluid infiltrated fault zones is not yet fully understood using the current modeling and experimental techniques. This study will address this critical challenge by integrating novel theoretical tools from material science, mechanics and computation and by developing an educational platform that nurtures a class of students and researchers who are intrinsically motivated in working on problems bridging geoscience and engineering. The research component of this CAREER project aims (1) to theoretically investigate the mechanical response of fluid saturated gouge layers sheared in the presence and absence of mechanical vibrations using a novel physics-based continuum viscoplasticity model based on Shear Transformation Zone theory. The model resolves complex feedback mechanisms between gouge compaction, dilation, pore pressure changes and shear heating leading to identification and discovery of complex strength evolution histories in fault zones connected with nucleation and propagation of nonplanar shear bands and stick-slip instabilities, and (2) to couple this new fault zone model with the elastic bulk to investigate earthquake rupture propagation in complex settings using a new numerical technique that couples spectral boundary integral and finite element methods. The theoretical models will be validated against a variety of laboratory measurements and seismic observations available in the literature. The educational component of this project aims (1) to facilitate and enrich interactions between material scientists, rock mechanicians and seismologists, through organization of interdisciplinary workshops and conference symposia, as well as leveraging social media platforms for disseminating interdisciplinary research products, and (2) to inspire students, especially minority and female students, to learn and participate in interdisciplinary research through various outreach activities, curricular material innovation, and REUs engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Continuous methods are similar to high school calculus, where the notion of the derivative of a function is used to find exact, optimal solutions to problems such as the shortest way to swim across a moving creek. An example of a combinatorial method is multiplication, where one follows a simple step-by-step method (algorithm) to compute a product. In optimization, both techniques have been used to compute the optimal solutions for many problems. One such example is airline scheduling, which combines aspects of staff scheduling, route planning, and even profit maximization. Recently, a breakthrough in optimization has combined these approaches at a lower level. Combinatorial problems (e.g., scheduling staff) are translated to continuous ones (e.g., multi-variable real number function optimization). Combinatorial structure is re-imposed, based on understanding of the original problem, to speed up calculus-based methods. This has led to remarkable breakthroughs in producing theoretically fast algorithms for basic problems such as the solution of linear systems. Such algorithms are applicable, for example, in climate modelling, weather predictions, and oil exploration. The technique is also making exciting inroads into the area of linear programming, which is used, for example, in the previously mentioned application of airline scheduling.<br/><br/>In this project, the idea of ""pre-conditioning"" a function is studied to allow for continuous (""calculus-based"") optimization techniques to run faster. One example is producing an interpolation of a function on a line. The value of the function is specified at particular points, and one wishes to produce the ""smoothest"" interpolation on the many points on the line. This can be viewed as a multi-variable problem where the value of each point is a variable, but one loses the structure of the line. Re-incorporating this structure into the multi-variable optimization techniques produces very fast algorithms. This simple intuition has been applied to more complicated situations, ranging to very general problems in convex optimization, and is yielding fruit. This project will attempt to further understand and extend the applicability of these techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Components that are fabricated from this new composite will have higher impact strength and reduced susceptibility to delamination, compared to commercially-available carbon fiber composites. The broader impact of this project includes providing engineers with a new tool to implement previously unfeasible designs that drastically improve performance while reducing energy consumption and material waste. The rapid adoption of carbon fiber composites in the wind energy, aerospace, and defense industries provides an opportunity for the novel material developed in this project to disrupt the $25-billion global carbon fiber composite market. Effective scale-up to industrial production of the novel carbon fiber composite can revitalize the Massachusetts textiles manufacturing ecosystem and increase the competitiveness of the U.S. advanced materials manufacturing base.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is the continuous production of a three-dimensionally (3-D) reinforced carbon fiber prepreg that features a carbon fiber fabric reinforced with vertically aligned short carbon fibers.

To further improve performance of these nanopore-evaporation-associated applications, it is essential to understand the ultimate transport limit of evaporation from nanopores. This has been a long-lasting challenge because experimental investigation based on existing nanoporous membranes cannot provide much insight due to difficulty in measuring important parameters. This project will solve this big challenge by directly measuring and studying evaporation from single nanopores. New insights gained from this project will deepen our understanding of evaporation at the nanoscale and shed light on developing optimized evaporative structures. This project includes education/outreach activities for students at various academic levels. Cartoon animations and hands-on lab kits will be developed for K-12 students. Research opportunities will be provided for K-12 students and undergraduates, especially those from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are to understand the kinetic-limited evaporation from nanopores and to achieve the ultimate performance of evaporative nanoporous structures. A novel hybrid nanopore-nanochannel device design will be developed for evaporation measurements and the dependence of the kinetic-limited evaporation flux on nanopore dimension, surface properties, and operating conditions will be systematically investigated. To further understand the separate contributions of the effective evaporation area and the evaporation coefficient on kinetic-limited evaporation, evaporation from atomically thin nanopores will also be investigated. Experimental results of these studies will be compared with MD simulations to gain a complete understanding of the observed dependence. Finally, nanoporous membrane based bi-porous evaporator with optimized pore dimension and porosity will be created and the ultimate evaporation performance of such membranes will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The U.S. population is predicted to grow by 50% before 2050, adding nearly 140 million people. Accommodating such growth requires an understanding of urban form and both its influence on and its response to surrounding land-uses. Metropolitan areas contain only 20% of the total U.S. farmland and 80% of the population. Yet, metropolitan-area farms account for the majority of fruit, nut, berry, vegetable, milk and egg production. It is this array of fresh food that is needed to battle the upsurge of unhealthy eating and associated diet-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Encouraged by growing consumer preferences and willingness to pay more for local foods, many metropolitan farms are increasingly turning to direct marketing through you-pick operations, farm stands, farmers' markets, and Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) as a way to stay economically competitive against the housing market. This project explores how social networks formed through local food marketing influence land-use regulations, agricultural economics, and urban development patterns.<br/><br/>To inform a ""science of cities,"" this research tests a novel explanatory theory. Ecologists have identified structural complexity as an important indicator for total system growth and resilience. Structural complexity fosters niches. The presence of niches allows for a diversity of uses. Such diversity fosters resilience in the face of natural disasters, disease or extinction of one species. Structural complexity can be estimated. For example, carefully laying a flexible chain over the surface of a coral reef provides a simple indicator of surface roughness, termed rugosity. Rugosity measurements correlate with the availability of habitat niches and related coral biodiversity, total reef species, reef growth and resilience to stressors. Drawing from ecology, this research translates the metric of rugosity -- an interface measurement that indicates niches, rich social networks, and potential resilience to shocks -- to urban and agricultural studies. This research will measure the structural complexity of urban areas as critical to urban and agricultural growth (land values, population growth, production), shared metabolism (supply chains, resource use), and resilience (response to economic and natural disaster). Satellite imagery provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service now allows high-fidelity spatially explicit data for multivariate regression analysis on farmland loss, crop diversity, and urban development. Collection of novel data on marketing channels allows social network analysis on the mediating effects formed through the food system on land-use. In sum, this research tests the hypothesis that farms that are more intertwined physically with urban lands will also be more intertwined socially through direct and local marketing, thereby changing diet-related health, job diversity, farm tenure, and land-use patterns for urban and agricultural communities alike.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If their evolved genetic differences are not great, the two species may mate and produce hybrid offspring. Between-species crossbreeding, once considered a rare and mostly inconsequential phenomenon, has now been documented in a wide variety of species pairs including brown/polar bears, dog/wolf, cow/bison, and even human/Neanderthal. Importantly, in each of these cases, at least some of the hybrid offspring were viable and fertile as evidenced by tracking genetic exchanges between these species pairs. Each of these past crossbreeding events can be considered a natural experiment across what were thought to be species barriers. This project will develop tools for detecting and analyzing genes that have moved across species. Application of the tool will focus on two species pairs for which past hybridization has been particularly important. Cows and bison were intentionally crossbred by ranchers in the early 1900s, such that most bison carry cow genes. Brown bears and polar bears had several episodes of past crossbreeding,and this continues to occur. Analysis of these species pairs will reveal which genes are refractory to movement across species and which are not. This information will be key to understanding the extent and consequences of future hybridization of any species pair of interest. Outreach to the public, students, and pre-service teachers will occur through a focus on the California Golden Bear and associated educational programs at the California Academy of Sciences. <br/><br/>The new flexible ancestry inference tool will be capable of localizing introgressed genomic regions even when only low-coverage DNA sequence data are available. The tool will incorporate complex demographic scenarios, such as multiple pulses of admixture, and will pinpoint regions of the genome that are of potential evolutionary significance by virtue of being high frequency or devoid of admixed ancestry. The application of this tool to two species pairs with known admixture histories will provide new insights into the processes of speciation and local adaptation, with the potential to inform management practices that seek to limit admixed ancestry in populations that are targeted for conservation. In addition, the tool will satisfy the growing need for improved methods of signal detection to infer evolutionary processes, providing the research community with a valuable tool for transforming genomic data into scientific inference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If animals with parasites are less likely to reach their destinations, then migration may allow populations to escape habitats where parasites build up over time. Understanding how animal migration affects the spread of disease is important to predicting disease risk, including to humans. This study focuses on monarch butterflies as a model system and explores the impacts of parasites on butterfly populations that migrate and populations that have recently lost their migratory habits. This study will also examine how non-migrating populations may influence the risk of having parasites by the migrating forms in areas where they come together. Field and experimental studies will also examine how these microscopic parasites influence how long butterflies live and their flight ability.  Through the high visibility and public appeal of monarchs, this project will support the participation of citizen scientists on a continental scale. The investigators will also mentor and train undergraduate and graduate students and will develop web and classroom based educational materials on host-parasite relationships and animal migration. This work will provide additional opportunities for middle school students and support k-12 activities. Finally, this work will inform efforts to conserve monarch butterflies and our understanding of how migration may influence the importance of parasites across many systems.  <br/><br/>Using a monarch butterflies and protozoan parasite system, the goal of this study is to examine how migratory and sedentary behaviors influence transmission risk and severity of infection. Research activities will integrate (i) an analysis of continent-wide citizen science databases to monitor monarch butterfly abundance and infection; (ii) field and experimental studies to test how monarch migratory behavior depends on non-native milkweeds and infection status, and to quantify parasite transmission rates; (iii) molecular genomics to ask whether genetic changes in sedentary populations might reinforce the loss of migratory behavior; and (iv) mathematical modeling to track how host and parasite populations respond to migratory vs. sedentary strategies. Information on the mixing of non-migrants and migrants, inferred from stable isotope analyses of field-collected monarchs, will inform mathematical models of interacting sedentary and migratory populations, to explore the consequences for disease spread and the persistence of migratory populations. The project will develop theory for how overlapping migration strategies alter, and are themselves affected by, parasite infection, and will shed light on the evolution of migration by characterizing genetic changes that accompany the recent formation of sedentary populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The commercialization of the proposed direct lithium-ion battery recycling technology will lower the energy consumption and emissions associated with battery production, reduce demand for raw battery materials and decrease lithium-ion battery manufacturing cost. Using directly recycled materials instead of raw battery materials will diminish or even avoid the negative environmental impacts from mining and processing ores and from disposal of hazardous waste. Reducing battery cost will facilitate the implementation of more efficient electrified vehicles, thus reducing petroleum demand and vehicle emissions. Finally, research on the end-of-life lithium-ion battery cathode, on the direct recycling process and on the recycled materials will advance the understanding of intercalation chemistry in nonaqueous and aqueous media and of electrode degradation during electrochemical cycling. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is to advance the direct recycling technology through the design and demonstration of a scalable electrochemical flow system capable of non-destructive relithiation and the optimization of post treatment operation for the recovered materials. The electrochemical flow system is capable of restoring the lost lithium in the EOL cathode material at any state of charge (SOC) and can be scaled to a commercially viable size. The cathode materials recovered in the proposed direct recycling process retain the same structure and morphology and exhibit equivalent electrochemical performance compared to the commercial virgin cathode materials. The recovery of high-value cathode materials substantially improves the profitability of lithium-ion battery recycling and is a key element of the business plan.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most obvious is a physical membrane, such as the cell membrane that separates the cytoplasm from its surrounding environment or the nuclear membrane that confines chromosomal DNA within the nucleus. Mechanisms for compartmentalization are essential as they override diffusive smoothing of concentration gradients that would otherwise homogenize cellular contents and fail to allow spatial regulation of critical cellular processes. A recently identified and current intense focus in cell biology is on chemical compartments that form in the absence of physical membranes.  This project focuses on a specific example: the binding of cytoplasmic proteins and RNAs into complexes that form protein-rich droplets by way of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). By bringing together mathematical, computational, and biological scientists, the investigators aim to develop a general computational modeling platform to study cytoplasmic droplets and their spatial distributions that arise from LLPS.  The aim is to understand mechanistically how these compartments establish and preserve cytoplasmic heterogeneity in mRNA localization and expression in live cells, and the molecular species, complexes, and kinetic timescales that are responsible. By applications of this platform to other live cells, there is the potential to understand the essential cell-specific molecular ingredients and chemical kinetics for LLPS, thereby contributing to understanding of the diversity of intracellular compartmentalization across cell biology. <br/><br/>There is a rich history in cell biology of the study of membranes and their role in establishing extracellular and intracellular chemical compartments. Yet, relatively little is known about how molecular proteins, organelles, and chromosomal DNA, within the cytoplasm or within the nucleus, chemically interact and self-organize to create, sustain, and evolve localized chemical and macromolecular compartments in the absence of physical membranes. Armed with resolved spatial and temporal experimental data of primary molecular species and species complexes, the investigators in this project focus on three specific aims.  1. A computational modeling platform to explore the input space of primary molecular (proteins, RNAs, protein-RNA complexes) and microscopic (nuclei, membranes) species, chemical species affinities, and spatial confinement conditions.  This platform will produce a phase diagram of outcomes that mimics live cell data (dynamic self-organization of complexes and molecular species, droplet formation due to liquid-liquid phase separation), and that reveals sufficient ingredients and interactions for membrane-less, intracellular chemical compartments, and their robustness. 2.  By way of coupled stochastic and continuum modeling, conditioning on ex vivo and in vivo experimental data, to discover sufficient molecular species, complexes, and hidden chemical affinities that reproduce the chemical compartmentalization of live cells. 3. To extend numerical tools for multiphase modeling to accommodate strong fluctuations and out-of-equilibrium behavior driven by chemical kinetics, viscoelasticity of droplets, and induced flow by liquid-liquid phase separation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the continental shelf , where the water is shallow and relatively well-mixed, the passage of strong storms can induce large Langmuir cells, the largest of which can span the entire water column and have a strong influence on sediment re-suspension. These so-called Langmuir supercells (LS) play an important role as vectors for the transport of sediment and bioactive material on shallow shelves: their quasi-organized nature makes them more effective than bottom boundary layer shear turbulence at moving material out of the low-speed layer near bottom and into the bulk flow for lateral transport. This study will analyze existing observations from three different sites at 15, 26 and 40m depths as well as high resolution numerical simulations to determine the influence on LS of a number of factors such as large scale flows, tidal currents, less dense surface layers and misalignment between wind and wave direction.  Continental shelves are biologically highly productive and LS have direct impact on processes affecting this productivity or distributing its products. Thus, it is essential that shelf models incorporate skillful parameterization of such dominant processes. This study will improve parameterizations used to account for Langmuir circulation in many coastal and regional models where the size of the domain precludes running the model at a high enough resolution to capture Langmuir circulations directly. One post-doctoral researcher, two graduate students and one undergraduate student in each summer will be trained in physical oceanography, turbulence dynamics and closures and numerical techniques. One of the students is from an underrepresented minority group.<br/><br/>In the coastal ocean, LS has been observed under tidal and geostrophic flow components, surface heat fluxes and misaligned winds and waves serving to influence LS strength and coherency, as measured through bottom-mounted vertical-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers (VADCPs). Observation sites consist of the Rutgers LEO observatory in 15m of water at the inner shelf off the coast of southern New Jersey, the Navy's R2 tower in 26m of water at mid-shelf off the coast of Georgia, and an additional site north of Cape Hatteras in 40m of water. Analyses of the measurements at LEO and R2 have demonstrated differences in LS characteristics, with more coherent and intense LS occurring at LEO. New analysis of the Cape Hatteras data as well as large eddy simulations (LES) of LS flows closely following the VADCP measurements at the three sites will elucidate the dynamics by which tidal and geostrophic flows, surface buoyancy and misaligned wind and waves combine to affect LS and associated vertical transport. The LES will help provide key information missing from the field data sets, such as detailed velocity structure in the surface and bottom boundary layers, required to make definite conclusions regarding the roles of the various forcing mechanisms influencing the LS at the different sites. LES will be used to obtain a scaling of vertical velocity fluctuations representative of the strength of non-local vertical mixing induced by LS under the various processes affecting its strength and coherency. The scaling of vertical velocity fluctuations will be used to inform a KPP (K-profile parameterization) developed by the PI accounting for the local transport of the overall Langmuir turbulence and the non-local transport induced by the LS. The updated LS KPP will be implemented in the one-dimensional vertical water column General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) for validation via comparisons with the LES and the field measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These lines are best observed during total solar eclipses, and they are used to explore the dynamics and thermodynamics of the coronal plasmas within the first few solar radii above the solar surface, where the solar wind and coronal mass ejections originate and are accelerated.  To achieve these science objectives, this project capitalizes on the pioneering insights achieved with the latest solar eclipse observations on 2017 Aug 21 of forbidden line emission, including imaging and spectroscopy.  Knowledge gleaned from observations of the Sun's corona during the upcoming total solar eclipses on 2019 July 2 and 2020 December 14 will fill a much-needed gap in ongoing investigations of the physical processes controlling the coronal plasmas and magnetic fields.  These observations will also impact the science programs to be executed by the future DKIST.  The PI has been leading solar eclipse observations since 1995, and she will continue to engage and inspire women faculty, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, through their involvement with the unique scientific endeavors offered by the expeditions.  The PI will present the results of the observations at conferences and will publish them in refereed journals.  She will also share the knowledge with the general public through lectures, with emphasis on the magic of our closest star and its impact on our immediate environment.  The research agenda of this RAPID project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The main objective of this one-year RAPID project is to build a state-of-the art instrument for solar eclipse observations that capitalizes on the unique diagnostic capabilities of coronal forbidden lines.  Coronal forbidden lines are best observed during total solar eclipses, and they are used to explore the dynamics and thermodynamics of the coronal plasmas within the first few solar radii above the solar surface, where the solar wind and coronal mass ejections originate and are accelerated.  Dominated by radiative excitation, emission from coronal forbidden lines in the visible and near infrared, as well as the continuum, can yield the chemical composition, temperature, density, non-thermal motions and outflows of the different constituents of the coronal plasma.  Valuable insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of the different manifestations of coronal heating processes can thus be gleaned.  Recent eclipse discoveries have shown that the temperature of the outflowing plasma is dominated by 1,000,000 K, while emission from closed structures and the bulge of streamers, is at 2,000,000 K.  They revealed that prominences, which are 100 times cooler and denser than the corona, are invariably enshrouded by the hottest material there, and directly linked to coronal structures, even when they erupt.   Chromospheric material from prominences escapes, unaltered, with the hottest coronal material in CMEs.<br/><br/>This project capitalizes on the pioneering insights achieved with the latest solar eclipse observations on 2017 Aug 21 of forbidden line emission, including imaging and spectroscopy.  In this project, the team will build a state-of-the-art instrument that expands the wavelength coverage of the existing imaging suite of Fe IX, X, XI, XIII, and XIV emission lines by adding lines from different charge states of Ar, Ni and S.  This enhances the diagnostic capabilities of the innovative imaging spectrometer to be built during this project by including the near UV and near IR wavelength ranges.  The upcoming 2019 July 2 and 2020 December 14 total solar eclipses over Chile and Argentina offer an opportunity for coordinated multi-site observations, which has been successfully proven with the observations acquired during the 2017 August 21 total solar eclipse over the mainland U.S.  Multi-site observations, with identical instrumentation, maximize data acquisition and enable studies of changes in coronal structures on time scales of tens of minutes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Terrestrial plants compete for light, water and soil nutrients. Many birds compete for access to food and nesting sites, and in the intertidal zone, shellfish compete for rocky substrate on which to attach themselves. Classic ecological theory predicts that when competition is important, species can coexist with others by having traits that differentiate their resource needs from those of their competitors. In turn, this prediction has led to the hypothesis that when communities comprise well differentiated species, competition must be a dominant process. Unfortunately, this hypothesis does not support key aspects of modern coexistence theory, which has demonstrated that even very similar competing species can coexist if the competitive advantage is small. This project will address this scientific controversy by developing a general eco-evolutionary mathematical model of intraspecific competition in which competition is explicitly linked to species traits and evolutionarily stable communities are identified. Ultimately, this work will lead to a better understanding of the distribution and abundance of organisms in natural communities and resolve these discrepancies in classic and modern theory. Additionally, this research will provide research training for a postdoctoral researcher and an undergraduate student. A teaching module in theoretical ecology will also be developed for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Most of the theoretical work on trait distributions arising from competitive interactions has assumed that a single trait (or at most a pair of traits) determines both the niche overlap and any fitness differences among competitors.  Under this assumption, trait distributions of climax communities generally demonstrate over-dispersion; however, it has also been shown that clumps of similar species can form at intermediate time-scales when their fitness differences are small (termed ""emergent neutrality""). This project will employ mathematical models of competition to compare patterns of trait variation that emerge under modern coexistence theory to data collected from natural communities. This project will incorporate a greater degree of biological realism than previous approaches, by modulating the extent to which niche differences and fitness differences are controlled by the same trait or different traits. Numerical simulations of a Lotka-Volterra competition model within an eco-evolutionary framework will be used to identify evolutionarily stable communities. The patterns of trait dispersion that develop will be summarized using a variety of metrics to demonstrate the patterns and mechanisms that underlie climax communities when traits have varying degrees of control over fitness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These characteristics, also known as functional traits, include features such as length, height, shape, weight, growth rate, sex, and reproductive state. Studying these traits provides insights into how communities of different types of animals come together and how species and communities respond to changes in their environment over time, which is critical for conservation efforts. However, very little information about functional traits is available, and what is available is difficult to combine with other data. How these traits are influenced by environmental changes - such as climate change, pollution, urbanization and human predation - and how they shift over longer timescales are poorly understood, and the need for this information is outstripping the speed with which scientists can collect these data. Digitized collections of animals representing life from the past two million years contain a treasure trove of information about these individuals' functional traits, but these data are stored in multiple places and in different formats. Researchers may have recorded dates differently, for example, or used a variety of terms to describe a single physical feature. Making these data widely available in standardized formats could help scientists study changes in functional traits through time, linking their observations of traits of modern animals to those from fossil and archaeological records. The Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies (FuTRES) project will gather trait data from digitized records; to engage communities of researchers to make these data available, standardized, and useable; and to develop a more complete workflow for using these data in research. <br/><br/>Functional trait data have revolutionized ecology and are transforming paleontology, but acquiring them requires extensive labor, not only in measuring traits but in managing and communicating the resulting data. When trait data are lacking, researchers substitute average values, or other characteristics like behavioral or dietary categories. These substitutes - assigned at the species level - obscure intraspecific changes in traits. FuTRES fills the clear need for informatics tools that give researchers access to existing trait data and a place to store new data as they are generated. FuTRES is assembling a varied collection of existing trait data, building a pipeline that converts data to an integrated, semantically enriched form, and developing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web platform to serve the data. One of the key innovations of FuTRES is the use of ontologies, an information science approach that creates computer-readable definitions of traits and describes the interrelationships of traits, organisms, collecting events, and other entities. In this way, FuTRES will make functional trait data searchable through reference to time, space, and vertebrate anatomy.  FuTRES will also provide access to trait data via popular data portals (e.g., VertNet) and software such as R, opening the data to scientists in biodiversity and other domains. The toolkit will be tested with mammalian use cases that leverage the massive scale of the unlocked data.  In sum, newly created access mechanisms and tools will provide novel approaches for analyses of trait variation across space and time, providing researchers in disparate fields discovery capabilities for relevant data that would otherwise have been invisible to them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to successfully navigate complex, dangerous buildings during a crisis, first responders need to build accurate spatial memories of unfamiliar spaces in a timely manner. This requires retention and processing of a large amount of information such as maps and verbal instructions. An apparent gap between the enormous information processing needs during a mission and the limited processing capacity of people creates a potentially fatal situation in emergency wayfinding. This project will contribute to the NSF's Big Idea ""Harnessing Data for 21st Century Science and Engineering"" by conducting fundamental research in information processing and engineering in the field of disaster management. This project will test the theoretical foundation of personalized wayfinding information systems that can effectively minimize the cognitive load of first responders on the individual level. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve emergency response wayfinding, which will save lives and potentially reduce economic losses during disasters. <br/><br/>This project has three interdependent scientific objectives. First, the research quantifies the structured relationship between spatial information and different forms of cognitive load in wayfinding tasks. Spatial information for wayfinding will be categorized and measured using semantic metrics; then a quantitative model of the relationship between spatial information and cognitive load will be examined. Second, the research explores cognitive resilience that helps identify and prevent an abrupt drop in wayfinding performance. Virtual Reality (VR) based multi-mission experiments are performed to examine the hypothetical nonlinearity of the relationship between cognitive load and wayfinding performance. Third, the research evaluates the effectiveness of personalized wayfinding information system in simulated mission tasks. A holistic VR experiment is performed to compare the new personalized system against the current universal spatial information systems. The outcome of the scientific investigation includes an adaptive wayfinding information system that dynamically tailors the way spatial information is presented based on the real-time cognitive load of individual first responders, measured by a set of neurobiological and physiological metrics. The project will immediately impact first responders primarily firefighters for their missions.  A number of collaborative outreach activities are planned between two project sites: Texas A&M University and Northeastern University. These include advancing VR technologies for STEM education, integrating the research outcomes to curriculum development at both institutions, and developing a free online course and open-source project for general public access.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A lack of these essential amino acids in a diet leads to malnutrition. Much of the world's human and livestock populations rely on seeds for protein, but most staple crops seeds are deficient in several essential amino acids. Efforts to fortify the amino acid composition of staple crop seeds have had limited success since plants respond to induced protein composition alterations by activating a regulatory mechanism that ""resets"" it back to an original state. While beneficial to the plant growth and development, this mechanism has been a major hurdle to biofortification efforts. Fortunately, it is also known that different cultivars/varieties display natural variation in their seed amino acid composition, which means that the regulation of these compounds is genetically driven and thus should be amenable to manipulation. Therefore, this project aims to identify the key genes involved in this regulatory mechanism by analyzing hundreds of Arabidopsis strains, which display natural genetic and seed amino acid composition variation.  Subsequently the potential role of the identified candidate genes will be tested using classical physiological and genetic approaches. Identifying new genetics targets will help facilitate the breeding of new crop varieties that can support our nation's and world's growing population.<br/><br/>It is important to identify the genes that underlie the amino acid composition of dry seeds. Doing so will shed new light on a complex regulatory mechanism in plants as well as facilitate efforts to fortify staple seed crops. While much is known about amino acid metabolic pathways, little is known about their regulation, especially in seeds. So far, it is known that alterations to the composition of seed storage proteins (i.e., the major amino acid sink) lead to proteomic reprogramming and activation of a rebalancing mechanism, a response that suggests tight regulation of this trait. Seed amino acid composition varies substantially across genotypes within the same genus. This observation implies that the genetic architecture responsible for this natural variation includes, at least in part, the genes involved in responding to amino acid sink alteration and activation of the rebalancing mechanism. This project aims to elucidate key components of this genetic architecture in Arabidopsis thaliana using two approaches: (1) a GWAS on amino acid composition measured from dry seeds of an 800-accession association panel and (2) an amino acid/gene expression correlation-based network analysis of wildtype and two storage protein mutants with active rebalancing phenotypes. The candidate genes identified from each approach will be compared, and the top candidate genes will be tested for involvement in amino acid regulation via knockdown and overexpression experiments.  The identified genetic regulators will provide new targets for breeding programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Field studies and groundwater models both indicate that groundwater with a range  of transit times contributes to streamflow at any given time. However, field studies suggest the relative contribution of young groundwater (i.e., groundwater with short transit times) to streams is substantially less than calculated in modeling studies. This discrepancy in the groundwater transit time distribution (TTD) leads to a very different understanding of streamflow sources, fundamentally different predictions of the future impact of groundwater discharge on stream water quality, and potentially different perspectives on the design and assessment of efforts to manage non-point-source contamination in aquifers. This project will conduct field measurements and groundwater modeling to investigate differences in groundwater TTDs, and to determine and understand the processes that drive TTD at a range of spatial scales. Results of the project will assist water resources managers, regulators, and consultants to better understand and manage both water quantity and quality. Information will be disseminated through Cooperative Extension programs.<br/><br/>The overall goals of this project are to (1) evaluate why there is a discrepancy between TTDs derived from groundwater measurements (field sampling of age-dating tracers) and groundwater models, (2) investigate how these processes may be better understood by using both field measurements and models in nested watersheds at a range of scales (14-3900 km2 in this project) and (3) determine the processes that control the shape of the groundwater TTDs,. This project will be conducted in a watershed overlying the High Plains aquifer in the Nebraska Sandhills, where groundwater accounts for approximately 90% of the annual stream discharge. The TTDs will be determined using age-dating tracers for both young and old groundwater (3H/3He, SF6, 14C, 4He). Groundwater age information will be coupled with discharge measurements in streams and groundwater discharge measurement from tube seepage meters in streambeds. The tracer-based TTDs will be compared to groundwater TTDs derived from particle tracking simulations in a numerical groundwater model (MODFLOW), at both the reach and watershed scale. The model will be used as a tool to investigate differences that arise between tracer- and model-based TTDs. For example, the project will investigate the variation in groundwater recharge relative to the stream channel, and if a higher resolution and more accurate representation of recharge in the model leads to better agreement between field- and model-based TTDs. The model will also be re-calibrated using groundwater age data to evaluate how TTDs compare to field-based estimates after refinement and recalibration.

This study explores how the influence of top predators in a terrestrial environment is linked across ecosystem boundaries to impact primary production and food webs in aquatic environments. This study also explores how aquatic ecosystem responses to predators can reverberate back out of the stream to impact terrestrial predators that rely on the export of emerging adult insects from the stream. Cross-ecosystem food web connections will be studied at three different National Parks (Zion, Rocky Mountain, and Yellowstone National Parks), thereby providing replication at large spatial scales and leveraging the opportunities that National Parks provide to educate the public about food web ecology and the role of top predators in structuring our ecosystems.  This research will be the first of its kind to investigate reverberating effects of trophic cascades whereby indirect effects may cross ecosystem boundaries (terrestrial to aquatic) and then subsequently reverberate back to animals and plants in the original ecosystem (aquatic back to terrestrial).  This work will provide a more complete picture of how the loss of top predatory species worldwide may be indirectly influencing many distantly connected species.<br/><br/>Previous investigations have demonstrated the indirect role of top predators (e.g., wolves in Yellowstone Park and mountain lions in Zion National Park) in control of riparian vegetation along streams.  In addition, streams and riparian zones are connected by well-understood processes of material and organism exchange, making them ideal systems to identify and quantify trophic reverberations.  The study will be conducted in streams and adjacent riparian zones and will encompass (1) streamside ungulate browsing and riparian plant communities, (2) community composition and abundance of in-stream biota, quantification of terrestrial fluxes (organic matter and invertebrate) fluxes to streams, and diets of stream biota, and (3) emergent adult aquatic insects in the riparian zone and the response of spiders and bats. These riparian insectivores serve as a bellwether for changes in stream insect emergence and stream-riparian linkages. In each park, replicate study sites will be established along streams with and without controls on ungulate browsing of riparian woody vegetation.  By comparing within and across three national parks, this study will yield a greater understanding of how community and landscape context may mediate the strength, or even sign, of reverberating responses to terrestrial top-down control of ungulate browsing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacteria and archaea can adhere to surfaces using long, ""sticky"" filaments that protrude from their cell membranes called type IV pili (T4P). These filaments, which are made of thousands of copies of a protein called pilin, are incredibly strong, yet simultaneously extremely flexible. For example, a single bacterial T4P filament can support up to 10,000 times a bacterium's body weight, and T4P can be stretched to three times their original length without breaking. This project will use a computational approach known as molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the structure and dynamics of T4P filaments. Using this computational approach, simulated forces will be applied to T4P filaments to probe how they respond to being stretched, which will allow the identification of interactions that provide T4P with their great strength. The insights about T4P that will result from this work will inform applications in bionanotechnology, the role that T4P play in bacterial adhesion and motion, and will expand our general knowledge about protein filaments. Furthermore, this project will provide significant training to undergraduate students in a highly cross-disciplinary area of research at the interface of biology, physics, chemistry, and computer science. It will also develop computational learning modules and incorporate them into the undergraduate science curriculum to train students in the computational methods that are increasingly important in all scientific fields.<br/><br/>This project uses a computation/theory-led approach to: (1) investigate the dynamics of T4P filaments from three organisms, N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, and P. aeruginosa, at the all-atom level of resolution using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, and (2) develop coarse-grained models to study the structural properties of T4P filaments, including the structural transition that occurs for T4P under external force. This comprehensive, multi scale computational approach will provide insights into the strength and dynamics of T4P across multiple length and time scales relevant to T4P function, and importantly will bridge the gap in knowledge that currently exists between the experimental and theoretical understanding of the biomechanics of T4P filaments. Specifically, all-atom simulations will be used to characterize T4P structural heterogeneity and to identify the most important interactions between pilin subunits for maintaining T4P structural integrity in the initial stages of the polymorphic transition that T4P exhibit under the application of external force. External forces will be applied to T4P using steered molecular dynamics protocols. Additionally, all-atom and coarse-grained simulations will be used in combination to determine important T4P filament properties such as the Young's modulus, persistence length, and torsional rigidity. Finally, coarse-grained simulations of T4P filaments under force will allow for the development of the first model of the fully force-transitioned state of a T4P filament, providing unprecedented molecular-scale insights into how the filament changes shape at the molecular scale. The coarse-grained T4P model developed in this project will act as a starting model for bridging from the atomistic scale to the scale of cellular biology. This project will provide novel insights into T4P biomechanics, aid in the fundamental understanding of the role of T4P in prokaryotes, and improve understanding of the plasticity of helical biopolymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, Mexican-origin families are rich in social resources that can be leveraged to help children overcome obstacles in their educational paths. This project will identify critical points in the K-12 system and higher education when Mexican-origin children are at heightened vulnerability of leaving the STEM pipeline and community resources that promote their STEM persistence.

These factors do not act independently. For example, the strength of competition among trees may be stronger in low fertility soils. However, only a few studies have examined the simultaneous effects of physical factors and biological processes on tree growth and survival. Such synthesis is central to predicting tree species responses to environmental change. This is a critical issue in tropical forests because these ecosystems are experiencing rapid environmental change and play a key role in regulating global climate. This research will develop a novel analytical approach to characterize the joint effects of physical heterogeneity and local biological interactions on growth and survival of tree species across the island of Puerto Rico. The island has high tree diversity, marked environmental and climate gradients, and an extensive amount of existing data, making this an ideal site for this research. Results from this study will inform the likelihood of success of several USDA Forest Service initiatives to adapt to rapid environmental change. Existing collaborations between the researchers and local organizations will facilitate a direct impact on the management and conservation of Puerto Rican forests. Data will be made available online and provided directly to local management agencies, including the US Forest Service and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources. The researchers also will organize workshops on the analytical methods at Puerto Rican institutions. Finally, the project will train and employ a Puerto Rican technician and a postdoctoral researcher, contributing to STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>Range dynamics and community assembly reflect the interactive effects of regional environmental heterogeneity and local processes. Yet empirical examination of these interactions is rare. The researchers will develop a novel functional trait-based, spatially-explicit neighborhood approach to disentangle local effects of environmental heterogeneity and biotic interactions on tree growth and survival across Puerto Rico while accounting for individual trait variation. To do so, they will couple (a) tree trait measurements across species ranges traits, including traits related to water use strategies, (b) trait-based neighborhood models of tree growth and survival derived from data collected in 24 mapped plots, and (c) generalized joint attribute models that characterize species distributions with respect to regional environmental gradients using herbaria collections. They will test the following hypotheses: (1) the negative effect of local biotic interactions on tree growth and survival is highest at the most environmentally favorable sites for a species, fostering regional coexistence; (2) the spatial structure of intraspecific trait variation across environmental gradients fosters such coexistence. Results from this research will empirically examine the importance of individual trait variation in mediating regional species coexistence and test the importance of a stabilizing mechanism in promoting species-coexistence and diversity in tropical forests. The research will lay a conceptual foundation for future studies that place local community interactions within a biogeographic context and transform understanding of the environmental and biotic factors that mediate forest community assembly at regional scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most obvious is a physical membrane, such as the cell membrane that separates the cytoplasm from its surrounding environment or the nuclear membrane that confines chromosomal DNA within the nucleus. Mechanisms for compartmentalization are essential as they override diffusive smoothing of concentration gradients that would otherwise homogenize cellular contents and fail to allow spatial regulation of critical cellular processes. A recently identified and current intense focus in cell biology is on chemical compartments that form in the absence of physical membranes.  This project focuses on a specific example: the binding of cytoplasmic proteins and RNAs into complexes that form protein-rich droplets by way of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). By bringing together mathematical, computational, and biological scientists, the investigators aim to develop a general computational modeling platform to study cytoplasmic droplets and their spatial distributions that arise from LLPS.  The aim is to understand mechanistically how these compartments establish and preserve cytoplasmic heterogeneity in mRNA localization and expression in live cells, and the molecular species, complexes, and kinetic timescales that are responsible. By applications of this platform to other live cells, there is the potential to understand the essential cell-specific molecular ingredients and chemical kinetics for LLPS, thereby contributing to understanding of the diversity of intracellular compartmentalization across cell biology. <br/><br/>There is a rich history in cell biology of the study of membranes and their role in establishing extracellular and intracellular chemical compartments. Yet, relatively little is known about how molecular proteins, organelles, and chromosomal DNA, within the cytoplasm or within the nucleus, chemically interact and self-organize to create, sustain, and evolve localized chemical and macromolecular compartments in the absence of physical membranes. Armed with resolved spatial and temporal experimental data of primary molecular species and species complexes, the investigators in this project focus on three specific aims.  1. A computational modeling platform to explore the input space of primary molecular (proteins, RNAs, protein-RNA complexes) and microscopic (nuclei, membranes) species, chemical species affinities, and spatial confinement conditions.  This platform will produce a phase diagram of outcomes that mimics live cell data (dynamic self-organization of complexes and molecular species, droplet formation due to liquid-liquid phase separation), and that reveals sufficient ingredients and interactions for membrane-less, intracellular chemical compartments, and their robustness. 2.  By way of coupled stochastic and continuum modeling, conditioning on ex vivo and in vivo experimental data, to discover sufficient molecular species, complexes, and hidden chemical affinities that reproduce the chemical compartmentalization of live cells. 3. To extend numerical tools for multiphase modeling to accommodate strong fluctuations and out-of-equilibrium behavior driven by chemical kinetics, viscoelasticity of droplets, and induced flow by liquid-liquid phase separation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From the study of computational complexity there have arisen questions that stand as grand challenges of contemporary science. The objective of this project is to enrich the theory of computational complexity with new directions and techniques, and to use these techniques to make progress on long-standing open problems. Specific areas of investigation include the complexity of sampling tasks and of distributed tasks, and randomness.

Examples include systems based on wireless communication networks, sensor networks, radio-frequency identification (RFID), as well as frequency modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) and ultra-wideband (UWB) systems. Most of the solutions rely on established networks or interrogators, and the targets must carry devices such as cellular phones and RFID tags. FMCW/UWB systems can localize objects without requiring the targets to carry any device but need a large transmitted signal bandwidth to achieve desirable range resolution. This project will explore a radio frequency (RF) compressed sensing solution and a hybrid-mode localization mechanism for short-range wireless localization. The proposed solution will also be user-centered by efficiently sensing user activities and optimizing resource allocation. It will significantly reduce the hardware cost, power consumption, circuit complexity, spectrum usage, and signal processing load. The ultimate goal of this research is to achieve ubiquitous short-range wireless localization on low-cost mobile devices. It will influence many wireless systems and applications, and thus have broad impacts to our society.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop the next generation wireless localization system. Different from conventional compressed sensing radar or localization systems that mostly perform data compression during or after demodulation, the proposed solution will efficiently compress data based on multi-beam radiation patterns produced by an advanced RF beamforming array. The array will probe the space with randomized radiation patterns instead of a single scanning beam, thus reducing the amount of spatial samples and the resources required to take the samples. Compared with conventional digital beamforming, the proposed solution is advantageous in lower hardware cost, less power consumption and lower circuit complexity. In addition, a hybrid-mode localization mechanism will be devised to fuse the advantages of Doppler/interferometry, frequency shift keying (FSK), and FMCW detection modes, so that the spectrum usage and signal processing load are kept to the minimum by switching the detection mode based on the status of the targets. The system will further reduce spectrum usage by user-centered operation, which efficiently senses and tracks human subjects based on human motion characteristics. Special localization algorithms will be derived to identify the unique human behavior that is distinct from other objects.

This impact ranges widely from causing diseases to offering new kinds of antibiotics, to helping crops grow by fixing nitrogen in the soil. Metagenomics is the study of such microbial communities through their extracted DNA. One of the first questions to ask when studying such a community is: ""which organisms are present and at what abundance?""  Most current approaches to this so-called community profiling problem take a parsimonious approach: infer the presence of the fewest organisms possible that still agrees with the observed data. However, treating each organism as completely different from any other can lead to mis-estimates of the different kinds and amounts of organisms present, referred to as biological diversity. This is further complicated by the fact that historically there has been much disagreement about the proper way to analytically measure biological diversity. In this project, the investigators leverage a recently defined, unifying notion of biological diversity to address the problem of correctly profiling a microbial community which has in it organisms of varying similarity. To accomplish this, a new mathematical framework is put forward that utilizes the big data approach of compressive sensing. After advancing the mathematical theory, the investigators will create a software implementation that will allow biomedical researchers to study metagenomic communities while properly accounting for varying organism similarity.  While advancing discovery, this project promotes graduate and undergraduate student teaching and learning. In particular, students are guided to excel at interdisciplinary work in the fields of mathematics and biology. Furthermore, beyond the traditional dissemination routes of conferences and papers, a wide audience is also engaged through a collaboration with SciShow, a popular YouTube channel that will work with the PIs in creating episodes featuring metagenomics suitable for the general public.<br/><br/>Microorganismal community profiling, determining the identity and relative abundance of all microbial organisms present in a given environmental sample through their sequenced DNA, is an important first step in the study of such communities. Many tools and approaches have been proposed to profile microbial communities, and while these tools take advantage of particular properties of microbial genetics to perform the classification task, there is a general lack of rigorous mathematical approaches that allow for definitive statements to be made about such classifications. Furthermore, the estimated biological diversity of a community can vary widely depending on the computational approach used. This is problematic given that biological diversity is a key metric when studying the impact of a bacterial community on its surrounding environment and aberrations of this quantity have been implicated in a number of diseases. This difficulty is further compounded by the fact that there is much disagreement in the scientific community on how to measure biodiversity. Recently, however, it was shown that a single formula subsumes and unifies many of the most popular biodiversity measures. In this project, the PIs utilize this definition of biodiversity to develop a rigorous mathematical approach to simultaneously profile a microbial community and characterize its biological diversity. Mathematically, this reduces to developing (and proving results about) an optimization procedure where the objective function includes biological diversity. Intriguingly, such an approach parallels that of compressive sensing and other such ""big data"" sparsity promoting optimization routines. The main approach will be to reduce this measure of biodiversity to a quasinorm and appropriately modify existing proofs about the convergence and guaranteed reconstruction of such optimization routines. This will result in an optimization framework that allows for simultaneously profiling a microbial community and characterizing its biodiversity directly while considering organism similarity. This will be implemented in user-friendly software and used to analyze gut samples from healthy and sick pre-term infants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The location and magnitude of subduction earthquakes are strongly influenced by many factors, which vary significantly within a single subduction zone and among global subduction systems.

A large collection of geophysical datasets now provides us with an excellent opportunity to construct comparative models of the subduction system. By creating high-quality models of subduction systems, the project will provide new insights into understanding of fundamental subduction processes. This project will involve the development of young scientists at different early career stages, including an early-career female geoscientist, undergraduate and graduate students. More broadly, this project aims to develop teaching tools for undergraduate students, to provide opportunities for K-12 education, and to increase public knowledge of the importance of subduction research. <br/><br/>Three fundamental questions are at the core of this research: What are the scales of along-strike variations (segmentation) of subduction properties and to what degree are they correlated from one subduction zone to another? How do various scales of mantle flow interact with each other and control along-strike variation in, e.g., melt productivity and magmatism? And how do properties of the downgoing and overriding plates contribute to along-strike variation within the upper mantle? To fully understand segmentation, high-resolution tomographic models of multiple subduction zones are critically necessary in order to compare the characteristics and scales of segmentation. This project will investigate the structure of five subduction environments, using a joint receiver function (RF) and full-wave tomography (FWT). RFs will identify and delineate sharp velocity discontinuities. An advanced FWT will provide a powerful way to image the structure of the crust and upper mantle. Combination of RFs and FWT will detect a variety of seismic features. The outcomes of this project will help answer questions in the two following areas: 1) A new understanding of the types and scales of along-strike variations in subduction system. What structural correlations from crust to upper mantle can be imaged that may give insight to along-strike variations? What are the dimensions of segmentation? What are the relationships of subduction parameters with along-strike variations? What are the influences of segmentation on surface tectonomagmatism? 2) A key understanding of multi-scale mantle flow and the influences on along-strike variations. What seismic features are related to large-scale subduction-driven processes? What are the roles of regional geology and tectonic processes? How do interactions between plate-driven flow and regional convection relate to segmentation? Does small-scale convection control the spacing of segmented features? The research component will be complemented by an education and outreach effort, which will focus on developing a summer seismology education workshop for the Five-College undergraduate students. The PI will also introduce Earth science to underserved 8th-12th grade girls through the Girls Inc. Eureka! Program. Furthermore, the PI will establish a mechanism for public outreach using the adopted Transportable Array seismic station. Through the integrated work, the PI aims to devote to research, teaching, and outreach activities that will positively impact the subduction community and general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team will follow a sample of biology Ph.D. students through their final stages of graduate school and into early years of their scientific careers to determine which skills acquired during graduate education might predict and facilitate postdoctoral attainment and scholarly productivity. The project also will provide novel insights into inequalities in early career researchers' (ECR) trajectories and outcomes and inform policies and interventions aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of graduate training and postdoctoral support mechanisms. <br/><br/>The overarching framework for the study is Social Cognitive Career Theory. The research team proposes to integrate the social cognitive, socialization, and economic and sociological lenses to conduct a longitudinal study of 286 Ph.D. students as they complete their degrees and enter the workforce in the biological sciences. They will investigate four hypotheses: (1) Professional trajectories within the cognitive, community, and organizational careers of ECRs will reflect ""Matthew Effects"" in which small initial differences account for increasingly large differences over time. (2) Research skills, self-efficacy, and organizational career goals during graduate school will jointly predict initial attainment and persistence in a postdoctoral position. Variance explained by these factors for subsequent career trajectories will wane over time, and variance explained by indicators of successes within the community and organizational careers will increase. (3) The features and opportunities associated with postdoctoral positions will predict both linear and geometric trends in subsequent cognitive, community, and organizational career trajectories of ECRs, as well as persistence in a research career path. (4) Professional trajectories within the cognitive, community, and organizational careers of ECRs, including persistence in a research career path, will vary as a function of interactions between sociodemographic characteristics, skills development, and environmental factors. The researchers will use longitudinal structural equation modeling to estimate and characterize trajectories within each career type and to quantify anticipated ""Matthew Effects"". Longitudinal structural equation modeling also will be used to understand how trajectories are related to each other and to participants' skill development, motivational factors, and graduate/postdoctoral experiences, as well as how trajectories could vary by demographic characteristics. They will estimate a latent growth curve model for this purpose. The research results could generate new insights and interventions for diversifying the scientific workforce by facilitating more equitable outcomes.<br/><br/>The project is supported by the ECR program that emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.

Field studies and groundwater models both indicate that groundwater with a range  of transit times contributes to streamflow at any given time. However, field studies suggest the relative contribution of young groundwater (i.e., groundwater with short transit times) to streams is substantially less than calculated in modeling studies. This discrepancy in the groundwater transit time distribution (TTD) leads to a very different understanding of streamflow sources, fundamentally different predictions of the future impact of groundwater discharge on stream water quality, and potentially different perspectives on the design and assessment of efforts to manage non-point-source contamination in aquifers. This project will conduct field measurements and groundwater modeling to investigate differences in groundwater TTDs, and to determine and understand the processes that drive TTD at a range of spatial scales. Results of the project will assist water resources managers, regulators, and consultants to better understand and manage both water quantity and quality. Information will be disseminated through Cooperative Extension programs.<br/><br/>The overall goals of this project are to (1) evaluate why there is a discrepancy between TTDs derived from groundwater measurements (field sampling of age-dating tracers) and groundwater models, (2) investigate how these processes may be better understood by using both field measurements and models in nested watersheds at a range of scales (14-3900 km2 in this project) and (3) determine the processes that control the shape of the groundwater TTDs,. This project will be conducted in a watershed overlying the High Plains aquifer in the Nebraska Sandhills, where groundwater accounts for approximately 90% of the annual stream discharge. The TTDs will be determined using age-dating tracers for both young and old groundwater (3H/3He, SF6, 14C, 4He). Groundwater age information will be coupled with discharge measurements in streams and groundwater discharge measurement from tube seepage meters in streambeds. The tracer-based TTDs will be compared to groundwater TTDs derived from particle tracking simulations in a numerical groundwater model (MODFLOW), at both the reach and watershed scale. The model will be used as a tool to investigate differences that arise between tracer- and model-based TTDs. For example, the project will investigate the variation in groundwater recharge relative to the stream channel, and if a higher resolution and more accurate representation of recharge in the model leads to better agreement between field- and model-based TTDs. The model will also be re-calibrated using groundwater age data to evaluate how TTDs compare to field-based estimates after refinement and recalibration.

The motivating problems - several of which have been intensively studied in statistical and mathematical physics as well as in computer science - touch fundamental questions such as the convergence time to equilibrium at the critical point of phase transition for classical models such as 2D and 3D Ising and Potts models under different boundary conditions, cluster interfaces at equilibrium (both interesting on its own accord, and crucial for the analysis of the dynamics), and the role of the underlying geometry on the dynamics, or the lack thereof - whereby dynamical features are universal on a broad class of graphs. <br/><br/>The first research direction focuses on the classical Ising, Potts and FK model on d-dimensional tori, and examines two of the most common Markov chains used to sample them/model their evolution - Glauber dynamics and  Swendsen-Wang dynamics. The phase transition that both the dynamical and static models undergo has received much attention, yet various basic problems have so far been out of reach of rigorous analysis in all three temperature regimes (high/low/critical). The PI proposes to study several such problems, including a power-law for mixing at criticality for the extremal 4-color Potts model in 2D vs. slow mixing in 3D, and establishing the cutoff phenomenon for the FK model off-criticality. A second research direction aims to understand properties of cluster interfaces in these models under various boundary conditions (b.c.): The PI plans to study rigidity and fluctuations of 3D Ising and 2D Potts interfaces under prescribed b.c., towards showing fast mixing for the 3D Ising model with plus b.c. and critical 2D q-state Potts model with free b.c. for all q. The final proposed topic compares the behavior of systems of interacting particles on lattices to other environments. For the SK spin glass model, various features of the static measure are known to be universal in the law of the interactions, and the PI proposes to establish an analogous statement for Langevin dynamics; for branching Brownian motion, the PI will investigate the law of the maximum in the presence of a periodic environment affecting the particles; and for the stochastic Ising model, the PI aims to show an aspect of sensitivity to initial conditions that is special to lattices, contrary to the behavior on typical random regular graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This fundamental principle underlies the continuity of life on Earth. It also shapes contemporary adaptations. Yet, despite the importance of this principle, scientists know little about how current adaptations in animals are shaped by past functions, random events or current necessities. This research addresses this question directly, by studying a common bird species, the House Finch. Over the last century, House Finches have successfully colonized much of North America. As a result of their ongoing colonization, House Finches are now found in a wide range of habitats. They have evolved diverse, yet precise, beak shapes that enable them to thrive in new environments. Capitalizing on a unique network of long-term study populations that span diverse habitats and histories, the researchers will trace the origin of developmental mechanisms that produce such versatility. The key benefit of this work is that it allows us to decipher how a species history shapes and predicts its current adaptability and future survival. The highly visible nature of bird invasions helps ensure continuing public participation in this research. In addition, the researchers will take advantage of well-established local media contacts, and collaborations with a range of tribal, rural, and naturalist groups to engage public audiences. <br/><br/>For evolution to proceed, maintaining currently adaptive traits must not prevent innovation in the same traits. Although such a system must be in place for traits to evolve, its organizational principles are largely unknown. In this project, the researchers focus on a natural system where it is possible to directly observe how the past influences the development of new adaptations. As House Finch populations have expanded across North America, they have created a network of recently established populations that differ in the amount of time each population has been established in a new environment. These populations allow the researchers to simultaneously observe how complex beak architecture evolves to different habitats as it happens. Specifically, by exploring patterns in transcription and growth factors known to regulate beak development, the researchers can gain insight into how the past influences adaptive evolution. The contrast between the patterns observed in transcription and growth factors provides crucial insight into the mechanisms behind historical continuity of past and present functional forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How quickly can species adapt to environmental change? Do different species respond to new conditions in similar ways? A powerful way to answer these questions is to look to the recent past. This project uses a striking example of rapid adaptation - where several species have adapted to the same environmental change - to study the predictability of evolution. The backdrop for the project is White Sands, a dramatic gypsum dune field in New Mexico. The dunes are geologically young, and the stark white sands contrast dramatically with the brown soil of the surrounding desert. Over the last few thousand years, a number of animal species have evolved blanched coloration to camouflage with the white habitat. This project focuses on comparing patterns of evolution in three desert lizard species, all of which have rapidly adapted to the extreme White Sands environment. By studying the genomes of the white sands lizards and their neighboring dark soil relatives - the researchers can understand how quickly - and how predictably - adaptation occurs in novel environments. White Sands provides an example of ""evolution in action"" - a case of evolutionary change over short, observable timescales. It also provides a setting for education and outreach. The researchers teach an annual ""Lizard Camp"" for local low-income middle school students and an annual ""Biodiversity Day"" for public school Kindergarteners, and work with a variety of schools, parks, and publishers to provide educational materials that instill a sense of wonder about biological diversity and the scientific process. This project contributes to understanding rules of how, and how predictably, genetic changes lead to changes in organismal traits that are important for the survival of species in natural and managed environments.<br/><br/>It is often difficult to disentangle the contribution of different factors to adaptation in natural systems. However, White Sands offers replicated adaptation across multiple independent species, providing an opportunity to understand evolutionary predictability. The project applies an integrative genes-to-ecology approach to study the factors that determine the direction and magnitude of evolution in White Sands lizards. The project has three areas of investigation, focused on factors that influence whether species will exhibit a shared evolutionary response to changing conditions: natural selection, genomic architecture, and population demography. Mark-recapture studies will be used to quantify the strength of natural selection across species. Whole genome sequencing will be used to determine whether the genetic architecture of adaptive traits is parallel across species. Demographic modeling will be used to understand how gene flow affects phenotypic response across species. The approach explicitly integrates studies across multiple scales and methods in a single framework. Ultimately the research aims to reveal the factors that contribute to predictability of evolutionary change in the natural world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, applications can only make use of multiple devices if the device owners agree to cooperate with each other.

This is particularly true in drylands where climate, soils, and human activities interact to produce desertification, the reduction or loss of ecosystem services in arid and semi-arid regions that negatively affect people, animals, and plants. Nearly the entire western half of the United States is considered a dryland and our country's Dust Bowl of the 1930s is often cited a classic large-scale example of desertification. Severe droughts, inappropriate agricultural practices, and fragile soils caused widespread dust storms and enormous crop and cattle losses in the southern Great Plains. Severe droughts and attending famines in semi-arid Africa and parts of Asia have also been linked to desertification. Because it affects a huge portion of the globe's population, there is a United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), which was signed in 1994. Despite these historical events and global concern, desertification remains a poorly understood and often controversial environmental process. Basic questions concerning its rate, extent and severity at local, regional and global scales are frequently examined in scientific studies but rarely definitively answered. One of the largest of these questions concerns whether or not desertification, once started, can be reversed and, if so, how?  This study uses a test case where droughts in the 1970s and 1980s initiated widespread desertification and where recent satellite images suggest large-scale clusters of increased vegetation, or potentially desertification in reverse. <br/><br/>Dr. Colin West and Dr. Aaron Moody of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will explore what factors drive vegetation trends in the greening of dryland zones. This study would test the hypothesis that local land-use practices drive regional vegetation trends. The research would take place in northern Burkina Faso, where one of the researchers has conducted long-term anthropological work since 2002. With previous support from the National Science Foundation, the research team has assembled a time series of satellite images that show distinct areas of both greening (where desertification may be in reverse) and browning (where desertification may be accelerating). Using these results as a guide, they seek to ground-truth these patterns by asking local farmers and herders about their perceptions of environmental change. The anthropologist, his graduate students, and local collaborators will conduct workshops using high-resolution satellite images in areas considered greening, browning and mixed. Using remote sensing procedures, other students will process and analyze these images to measure the amount of vegetation in the three zones. The study predicts that green zones will have more trees than brown zones and that the mixed zone will be intermediate. Workshops will local resource users will also seek their perspectives on how climate, land-use practices, and soils interact to produce these patterns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike baseballs and other classical objects with motion described by trajectories, electrons in materials are described quantum mechanically by mathematical wave functions. The study of wave functions of systems of many electrons reveals distinct classes leading to a new classification of electronic phases of matter - one that goes beyond the usual classifications based, for example, on the states of aggregation, or on the existence of macroscopic order, like magnetization. These kinds of electronic phases are referred to as topologically, or more broadly, geometrically nontrivial. In this project, the PI aims to bridge the gap between the pure classification of electronic phases and the physical properties of the phases. The PI will focus on developing theory to describe the materials' optical and transport properties, for example, how well the material can conduct electricity or reflect light. The PI will investigate various optical and transport properties in chiral materials.<br/><br/>The research is focused on topological phases in chiral materials. A chiral material  has a ""handedness"", so it is distinct from its mirror image. Chirality may arise because of the way the atoms are arranged in the crystal, or induced by external perturbations, like electromagnetic fields, or strain. Regardless of its origin, chirality strongly affects the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons in a material, and so, its experimentally measurable and technologically relevant properties. Examples include magnetization induced by an electron current, and rotation of the plane of transmitted or reflected polarized light. <br/>This award also supports educational and training activities, aimed at improving the STEM education in the state of Utah. The primary effort will be directed at the supervision of summer research of high school physics teachers; creation of an extracurricular club for high school students, aimed at introducing its members to collaborative solving of research-type problems in physics; implementation of modern teaching techniques with particular focus on creating an inclusive environment for students from underrepresented groups. Further integration of the research and educational activities will be accomplished through supervision of graduate and undergraduate research, and establishing a journal club for graduate students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education on optical and transport properties of materials with nontrivial band geometry. The objective of this proposal is to provide theoretical insights into electrodynamic, hydrodynamic, and transport properties of disordered gapless topological phases, and to develop new theoretical approaches that would help reveal various geometric aspects of electron behavior in experiment.<br/> <br/>The research involves three main directions, integrated into an effort aimed at understanding optical and transport phenomena in gapless systems:<br/><br/>1. Nonlocal electrodynamics and electron hydrodynamics of gapless topological phases, including the theory of chiral electron hydrodynamics and the chiral vortical effect in crystals. One focus will be on the study of the anomalous Hall effect in the hydrodynamic regime.<br/>2. Theory of nonlocal transport in disordered chiral metals. The activity will include a study of the extrinsic contributions to the dynamic chiral magnetic effect; investigation of nonperturbative instanton physics in disordered Dirac systems; development of nonlocal transport theory in nonuniform and strained topological systems.<br/>3. Nonlinear optical and magneto-optical phenomena in nonequilibrium states of Weyl and Dirac metals.

Many people perceive women who take partner names as selfless, and women who keep their birth names as individualistic. This project will examine how marital name norms may evolve by identifying the conditions under which norm-breakers are given more leniency. The project examines whether women and men who are middle-class or working-class, women and men who are primary breadwinners or secondary breadwinners, and women and men who do or do not plan to have children are viewed differently when they make unconventional marital name decisions, e.g., when women keep their names or when men hyphenate their names. Findings will add nuance to public discourse about marriage equality by showing how the public views unconventional actions, how female and male characteristics shape the consequences they face, and how views of name choice speak to larger public discourses about gender equality. <br/><br/>The project includes three survey experiments to examine whether and how economic resources and parental status change the effect that marital name choice has on views of women and men. Respondents will evaluate the female and male likability, dominance, interpersonal hostility, femininity and masculinity, perceived parenting ability and answer open-ended questions assessing their approval of marital name decisions. Qualtrics, an online survey platform that recruits respondents, will collect data for each experiment. The first study will examine whether and, if so, how views of norm-breakers differ based on gender and social class. Hypotheses suggest that middle-class women and men may have more freedom to break the norm because middle-class Americans are viewed more positively than working-class Americans. The second study will examine how perceptions of norm-breakers differ based on relative income, in addition to gender and class. Hypotheses suggest that individuals who are primary earners in their relationships may have more bargaining power and leverage to break norms. The third study examines how views of norm-breakers differ based on parental status, and how this relationship may vary by gender and class. Hypotheses suggest that gender norms will be more rigid when a couple has children, so women may have less flexibility to break name norms if they express plans to have children. Each of the three experiments randomly assigns respondents to conditions that systematically vary the respondent marital name choice (woman takes name of husband, both keep names, both hyphenate), gender (woman, man), as well as class (working/middle-class; Study 1), relative income (woman/man primary earner; Study 2) and parental status (plan/do not plan to have children; Study 3).

There are two main ways that ocean waves can generate microseism energy: 1) the interaction between waves traveling in different directions in the open ocean (secondary microseisms), and 2) the interaction of waves with the seafloor in shallow areas near the coast (primary microseisms). We presently have a good understanding of secondary microseisms, but the generation and propagation of primary microseisms is not well understood.  Recently, it has been discovered that several large lakes around the world also produce microseism energy, including Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone Lake provides a unique opportunity to study microseisms because, unlike the large oceans, it is relatively small and can be completely surrounded by seismic instruments, which gives us the opportunity to pinpoint the locations where microseisms are being generated and to study how they propagate into the surrounding regions. Our project will take advantage of the ongoing HD-YLAKE project, which deployed an array of seismometers on the floor of Yellowstone Lake, by supplementing those instruments with arrays of seismometers on the lake's perimeter and islands. In addition, we will also deploy instruments to simultaneously measure key atmospheric information (air temperature, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction) and the lake waves (amplitude, period, and direction) while the seismometers are recording. This combination of atmospheric, wave, and seismic data has never been collected in one place before, and it will provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand the processes that generate microseisms. Our results will have broad implications for the study of microseisms, and ultimately, we want to develop the ability to use these naturally occurring seismic waves to image the Earth's structure. This is an exciting possibility in Yellowstone Lake, because it hosts active hydrothermal systems that are believed to create large gas pockets in the lake floor sediments, and the microseism propagation velocity should be very sensitive to the presence of gas. As a broader impact, the investigators will work with Yellowstone Park educators to make their results accessible to the wider public through their exhibits.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:  It has recently been found that many lakes generate observable microseisms at periods near 1 s.  Observations from land-based seismometers deployed near lakes show that the microseisms propagate as short-period Rayleigh waves (Rg), often with prograde particle motion because of the low velocity of lake sediments. However, it is unknown if the source process is linear, corresponding to primary ocean microseisms, or non-linear, corresponding to secondary ocean microseisms, or both. It is also unknown whether the source regions are predominantly in the open water or near the shoreline, and how the microseismic wavefield evolves as it crosses the shoreline. Yellowstone Lake is an excellent natural laboratory for understanding shallow water microseisms because (1) there are no potentially confounding swells from distant storms, as there are in the oceans, (2) the source region is geographically small and can essentially be surrounded with seismometers, and (3) the Yellowstone Lake microseisms are a regular, repeatable phenomenon associated with diurnal wind variation during the summer and fall. An understanding of the source mechanism of Yellowstone Lake microseisms will likely be applicable to other shallow water regions around the world and could lead to improved imaging of very shallow Earth structure. The proposed work involves a monthlong deployment of (1) 40 three-component, autonomous, 5-Hz geophones around the perimeter of Yellowstone Lake and on islands within the lake, (2) four weather stations collocated with selected geophones, and (3) two wave-height recorders in the northern portion of the Yellowstone Lake. The deployment is planned for the summer of 2018 so that it can overlap with the ongoing, NSF-funded, HDYLAKE experiment, which deployed an array of 10 lake-bottom seismometers around an active hydrothermal site. The PIs and a graduate student will analyze the interdisciplinary data set in an effort to determine the origin and generation mechanism of the short-period (~1 sec) microseisms that were recently observed to originate from Yellowstone Lake during periods of open water.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It consists of the fabrication of ultra-short chains of 7 to 200 atoms in length, to test theoretical models and explore the emergence of new magnetic properties. This study provides a broader and deeper understanding of the magnetic behavior of low-dimensional systems and may have a direct impact on the development of a new generation of spintronic devices. This research has an active educational component. The project involves two graduate students who perform research for their Ph.D. thesis topic and two physics undergraduate students per semester. During these activities, students receive training at first synchrotron and neutron facilities and are exposed to state of the art advanced experimental techniques. Community outreach efforts associated with this project involve a partnership with high schools in San Antonio school districts and the production of short videos on different topics related to nanotechnology using a comical approach. These efforts are aimed to increase scientific knowledge in high school students and provide tools for science educators across the United States.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>This research is aimed to study three fundamental problems in magnetic 1D chains: 1) the determination of the extent and persistence of short- and long-range magnetic interactions as a function of the chain's length and defects, 2) the control and modulation of the spin along the chains, and 3) the exploration of proximity effects in varying composition magnetic/non-magnetic metal chains. To achieve these objectives, the PIs have developed a method for the fabrication of macroscopic arrays of 1D chains that allow precise control of their length, composition, and spin. Specifically, this research focuses on the ultra-short (and poorly explored) chain of ~7 to 200 atoms long. Monoatomic and varying composition chains are grown by Organic Molecular Beam Epitaxy (OMBE) using metallo-phthalocyanine (MPc) superlattices (SLs). MPcs are a family of planar organic molecules with one metal atom located in the molecule's center surrounded by organic support.  Many metal ions (Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, and Mn) can be substituted into the MPc giving rise to many isostructural compounds with different electronic (spin) configurations and physical properties. These molecules stack face-to-face giving rise to 1D metal chains when grown by OMBE. The orientation of the chain and its length can be controlled by substrate choice and thickness of the deposited MPc layer respectively. Moreover, using a SL structure, the chain composition, and spin can be varied by intercalating other magnetic and non-magnetic MPc layers. This project includes structural characterization (XRD and HRTEM) and magnetic measurements (SQUID, VSM, and AC susceptibility) in a broad temperature/field. Synchrotron techniques such as XMCD are used to obtain element-selective magnetic measurements and electronic configuration of the metals ions forming the varying composition chains. NEXAFS and DFT calculations allow determining the spin configuration of these elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The generally rigid arms in Y-shaped conventional antibodies are replaced with flexible and extendible linkers attached to binding domains that are smaller than those found in conventional antibodies. This new design allows multiple therapeutic targets to be bound at once, with greater binding strength and fewer off-target effects than was previously possible. This project will remake two of the most successful cancer drugs of the last decade, creating improved versions of each. In addition, a new molecule combining the functionality of both will be produced. If this project is successful, it may improve the treatments available for many kinds of advanced metastatic cancer, especially melanoma and lung cancer. Though the current focus is on cancer, the method described here may improve or combine the performance of many therapeutic antibodies; this project is just the first demonstration. The potential long-term impact of this SBIR Phase I project may extend throughout the pharmaceutical industry, representing a significant commercial opportunity and a milestone of applied biological research.<br/><br/>This project introduces a novel drug design that improves on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). It uses a chemical assembly method that joins immunoglobulin Fc domains to small, single-chain fibronectin binding domains through flexible, extendible, non-peptidyl linkers. The resulting flexible drug molecules benefit from two-handed cooperative binding, in which both domains are able to bind a disease target or targets simultaneously. They thus achieve higher binding affinity and target selectivity than mAbs, while also being smaller and easier to manufacture. These molecules can also be mono- or bispecific as needed. This project will produce flexible monospecific and bispecific molecules against the targets of the two most successful checkpoint inhibitors in current cancer immunotherapy. This project encompasses chemical synthesis, verification of binding stoichiometry, in vitro measurements of binding affinity to both purified protein and target cells, and cellular assays of both checkpoint inhibition and bispecific binding. It sets the stage for pre-clinical animal studies of these cancer drugs, and showcases a molecular design that could be used to improve most antibody therapies in the broader pharmaceutical market.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These robots are typically no more than a few millimeters in length, and rely on an external power source and control signal. Currently, it is possible to steer the swarm as a whole to a single destination (or perhaps, to a desired average location). However, realizing the full potential benefits of microrobot swarms will require the ability to simultaneously send independent commands, either to individual robots or to small subgroups.  Device designs have previously been explored that respond to different command amplitudes, however this approach quickly becomes impractical as the number of independently addressable robots grows. This scalability problem can be overcome using serial addressing schemes. Here, there are only a few distinct values for the control signal. Each independently addressable subset of robots is associated with a unique sequence of signal values, and will change its behavior only if the control signal contains that specific sequence. This project considers two fundamental issues that arise in implementing such a scheme. First is the need for on-board computation and memory allowing the robots to recognize the unique sequence and to change the robots state based on the detection of such sequence. Second is the need for a propulsive mechanism that couples to the robot state to allow differential guidance towards a target configuration. This project will advance two innovative engineering platforms that meet both needs. The first is electrostatically actuated, operates on a planar substrate, and is suitable for structured tasks such as microassembly. The second is magnetically actuated, operates in a liquid volume, and is suitable for biomedical applications such as drug delivery. The technical aspects of the project are complimented by outreach activities, including an annual microrobotics mobility competition to be held at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation -- a premier robotics conference for academia and industry. The results from this project will enhance the national health, by enabling new diagnostic and therapeutic uses for microrobot swarms. They will also promote the national prosperity, by enabling new classes of microassembly robots.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a practical control scheme to simultaneously control large numbers of microrobots. This will be achieved by using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to electromechanically and magnetically decode a sequence embedded in the single global control signal, and couple the reconfiguration of such sequence to the modification of the individual microrobot trajectories. This on-board sequence decoding will be accomplished through sets of on-board physics-based finite state machines (PFSM) that can accept a control sequence embedded in the control signal and change the behavior of the microrobots accordingly. The project will use both electrostatic and magnetic approaches to implement PFSMs, and to couple their ""accept"" state to the propulsion mechanism to modulate individual trajectories. Sets of stress-engineered electrostatic switches, which will latch in response to a pre-programmed control voltage sequence, will be used to implement PFSM on the electrostatic platform. Electro-permanent magnetic circuits, which change their magnetic moment in response to a sequence of global magnetic field, will be used to implement PFSM on the magnetic platform. The project will develop the theory for PFSM-based multi-microrobot control, construct both electrostatic and magnetic microrobotic PFSM platforms, and validate the concept by implementing the PFSM-based control on swarms of electrostatically and magnetically powered microrobots. The developed theory and approach will pave way for control of large microrobot swarms for numerous biomedical and microassembly applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasingly, however, it is becoming clear that many of the capacities of the brain arise from rich and complex interactions among its many regions.  Conversely, disorders of the brain and body often arise from subtle deficits that gradually impair the coordinated function of these interacting neural and biological systems until, at last, they begin to collapse and major symptoms are expressed.  Because these networks of interactions are too complex to simply intuit, scientists construct computer models so that the work of many different scientific studies can be brought together and gradually constructed into a unified understanding of the intricate systems under study.  This leads to broader understandings of our complex brains and bodies that would not be possible without such quantitative models.  The goal of the Myriad project is to provide a software platform for biological modeling that makes it much easier to harness the power of modern parallel-processing computer systems.  A second goal is to implement a simulator that uses this platform to create detailed models of neurons and neural networks.   <br/> 	 <br/>Myriad is a compartmental simulator platform based on a shared-memory architecture and designed for computational speed based on NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) or parallel CPU execution.  Its transformative potential arises from its capacity to automatically parallelize any compartmental model, including those with dense analogue interactions that presently cannot be effectively parallelized, and without requiring the end user to write special, platform-specific parallelization code. Myriad's shared-memory design eschews message-passing, and utilizes a radically granular design approach that flattens hierarchically defined cellular models and can even break up individual isometric compartments by state variable.  Specifically, all models that can be represented as isometric, stateful nodes (compartments) connected by any number of arbitrary mechanisms can be simulated with a high degree of parallelism, automatically thread-scaled to the number of available threads and load-balanced with very fine granularity to maximize the utilization of available CPU or GPU cores.  Programmatically, end-user models are defined in a Python-based environment and converted into fully-specified C99 code (for CPU or GPU) via code generation techniques that are enhanced by a custom abstract syntax tree (AST) translator and, for NVIDIA GPUs, a custom object specification for CUDA enabling fully on-card execution.  The first applications of Myriad will be to simulate biophysically realistic computational models of neurons and networks.  Importantly, however, Myriad's generic compartmental solver will be able in principle to parallelize any model framework that can be represented as stateful nodes coupled pairwise by arbitrary mechanisms.  Accordingly, to extend Myriad into new scientific areas of study (e.g., gene regulatory networks, epidemiological models, host-virus interactions, ecological systems) will require development only at the higher Python-based software layer, presumably by experts in the relevant field.  Finally, as present parallelization strategies are only able to accelerate sparselycoupled models, computational modeling recently has been drawn towards that subset of scientific questions capable of being addressed by these methods.  The release of Myriad may reopen the full breadth of quantitative biological questions that can be effectively addressed by parallel simulation.

It was constructed to measure new particle formation under highly controlled, ultra-clean conditions.<br/><br/>CLOUD is an international member-funded consortium supporting the maintenance and operation of the experiment.  Members raise research funding from their national agencies to participate. Experiments are conducted at CERN during 1-2 carefully planned campaigns per year, each lasting 8-10 weeks. These campaigns are planned, and data are assessed, during two major week-long consortium meetings each year, while more focused, intensive data analysis is carried out at all times by individuals, but also in several focused team meetings scheduled and hosted on an ad-hoc basis during the course of each year as analysis and interpretation require. Virtual team meetings via skype and other media are ongoing and continuous.<br/><br/>In addition to providing the required consortium fee, this project will support shipping and travel to CLOUD experimental campaigns and associated consortium meetings and data workshops. The doctoral and postdoctoral students associated with the project will be integrated into an international collaborative network of students and senior researchers who are among the most highly regarded in aerosol science and atmospheric chemistry. They will receive invaluable training in the conduct of international collaborative research.<br/><br/>The subject of the CLOUD experiments is of high national and international interest. Aerosol-cloud interactions are among the largest sources of uncertainty in the understanding of climate forcing and climate sensitivity. CLOUD experiments confirm that ions can stabilize nucleating clusters, and that, for otherwise weakly bound clusters (such as ammonia sulfuric acid, organics with sulfuric acid, and pure organics), ions can enhance nucleation rates by factors of 3-100 depending on conditions.  During the period of this project, three campaigns, CLOUD-13, CLOUD-14, and CLOUD-15, are planned.   The campaigns will focus on the following broad topics: the role of organic oxidation chemistry in new-particle formation and growth; new-particle formation in urban areas; new-particle formation in the marine atmosphere; and the role, if any, of charge in cloud-droplet formation and ice-crystal nucleation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These characteristics, also known as functional traits, include features such as length, height, shape, weight, growth rate, sex, and reproductive state. Studying these traits provides insights into how communities of different types of animals come together and how species and communities respond to changes in their environment over time, which is critical for conservation efforts. However, very little information about functional traits is available, and what is available is difficult to combine with other data. How these traits are influenced by environmental changes - such as climate change, pollution, urbanization and human predation - and how they shift over longer timescales are poorly understood, and the need for this information is outstripping the speed with which scientists can collect these data. Digitized collections of animals representing life from the past two million years contain a treasure trove of information about these individuals' functional traits, but these data are stored in multiple places and in different formats. Researchers may have recorded dates differently, for example, or used a variety of terms to describe a single physical feature. Making these data widely available in standardized formats could help scientists study changes in functional traits through time, linking their observations of traits of modern animals to those from fossil and archaeological records. The Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies (FuTRES) project will gather trait data from digitized records; to engage communities of researchers to make these data available, standardized, and useable; and to develop a more complete workflow for using these data in research. <br/><br/>Functional trait data have revolutionized ecology and are transforming paleontology, but acquiring them requires extensive labor, not only in measuring traits but in managing and communicating the resulting data. When trait data are lacking, researchers substitute average values, or other characteristics like behavioral or dietary categories. These substitutes - assigned at the species level - obscure intraspecific changes in traits. FuTRES fills the clear need for informatics tools that give researchers access to existing trait data and a place to store new data as they are generated. FuTRES is assembling a varied collection of existing trait data, building a pipeline that converts data to an integrated, semantically enriched form, and developing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web platform to serve the data. One of the key innovations of FuTRES is the use of ontologies, an information science approach that creates computer-readable definitions of traits and describes the interrelationships of traits, organisms, collecting events, and other entities. In this way, FuTRES will make functional trait data searchable through reference to time, space, and vertebrate anatomy.  FuTRES will also provide access to trait data via popular data portals (e.g., VertNet) and software such as R, opening the data to scientists in biodiversity and other domains. The toolkit will be tested with mammalian use cases that leverage the massive scale of the unlocked data.  In sum, newly created access mechanisms and tools will provide novel approaches for analyses of trait variation across space and time, providing researchers in disparate fields discovery capabilities for relevant data that would otherwise have been invisible to them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another axis is the amount of randomness used, as many common algorithms (such as opinion polls) use randomness as a key resource.  However, true randomness (such as that derived from physical phenomena) can be a scarce resource, and as such significant research has explored how the use of randomness can be minimized while still efficiently solving key algorithmic problems.  One prominent algorithmic challenge is to compute the volume of geometric objects.  While this problem is simple in low dimensions, it is significantly more difficult in the higher number of dimensions often required for applications.  While randomized algorithms have been developed for (approximately) computing volumes, comparable deterministic algorithms have yet to be developed.  This project will study techniques for the design of such algorithms.  It will also promote the study of pseudorandomness in general through course design, organization of workshops, and training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In particular, this project will design pseudorandom generators, which are maps that stretch a short seed of (true) randomness to a longer output of pseudorandomness, where this output is indistinguishable from random (from the perspective of the relevant algorithm). The construction of suitable pseudorandom generators is a well-known avenue to the derandomization of algorithms.  However, existing constructions of pseudorandom generators fall short of derandomization even for simple algorithmic problems.  This project will study new paradigms for the construction of pseudorandom generators, especially for those which can derandomize algorithms for geometric problems such as (approximately) computing volumes.  This study will be facilitated by combining existing tools, such as those from communication complexity and cryptographic pseudorandomness, in novel ways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historic flooding of the lower Mississippi in 2011 caused over $3 billion in agricultural losses and damage to infrastructure, with additional losses to flooding occurring again in 2016 and 2018. Seasonal and longer-term predictions of flooding along the Mississippi and its major tributaries remain a major challenge because the effects of climate variability, greenhouse forcing, and human modifications of the river are difficult to disentangle using short records from gauging stations that span less than 150 years. This project will develop records describing the timing and magnitude of flooding across the Mississippi River basin over the last millennium, and use these records to understand the influence of climate variability on flood activity. This work will improve predictions of flooding along the Mississippi River, a hazard that affects millions of people. The findings will be useful for planned and ongoing efforts to slow coastal land loss in the Mississippi River delta. The project will engage students at three institutions in research, and its findings will be disseminated to the public through an exhibit at the Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to reconstruct the frequency and magnitude of overbank floods along the lower Mississippi River and its major tributaries over the last millennium using the sedimentary archives preserved in oxbow lakes. Our ability to create this novel hydrological record is due to recent developments in paleoflood hydrology that demonstrate the unique ability of floodplain lake sediments to record individual flood events and their associated magnitude. Once developed, our reconstructions will be used to characterize decadal- to centennial-scale variability of flood activity, to compare with simulated discharge extremes in climate model ensembles, and to identify the regional and hemispheric circulation patterns associated with increased likelihoods of extreme floods on the lower Mississippi River and its major tributaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project seeks to understand how small forces applied to the hand can be used to alter clinically-relevant human gait patterns.  The project is significant because it generates the experimental data and models of human gait and sensorimotor cognition needed to develop a robotic device that will interact physically and intuitively with individuals with mobility impairments to enhance their quality of life.  By developing a robotic test-bed system and the models of human sensorimotor behavior that will guide its actions, this project will serve the national interest and advance the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health.  <br/><br/>The project takes a three-stage approach to advancing the objectives of the NSF's Mind, Machine and Motor Nexus (M3X) program, which are to understand how the human mind controls body movements during the manipulation of machines, and how machine response can shape and influence both the mindset and movements of the human user. First, the project team will use novel instrumented devices and motion capture technology to measure interactive human-to-human hand forces and the resulting gait motions that occur during the proposed therapeutic intervention. In Stage 2 they will use machine learning techniques to develop a model of the motor and cognitive transformations that occurred during the human-to-human experiments of Stage 1. Finally, the team will embed the models within a novel robotic test-bed that will implement physical human-robot interactions at the hands. Human-robot experiments will evaluate the ability of the test-bed to promote desired changes in clinically-relevant gait characteristics such as gait speed, step length and step cadence.  Fundamental issues addressed by the project include: 1) identifying the relationships between hand forces, gait dynamics and perceived intents of the instructor (therapist) and student (patient) that arise during a simplified version of rehabilitative partner dance; 2) modeling those relationships so as to enable prediction of how small hand forces indirectly change human gait dynamics; and 3) developing a robotic gait coach capable of promoting desired changes in human gait dynamics.  In addition, the project supports education and promotes diversity through innovative outreach activities that will engage teams of students and older adults from underrepresented communities in the conception, design and prototyping of mobility-related assistive technologies. The project outcomes may have long-term impact on the quality of life of millions of Americans with deficits of gait by developing a robotic system that can assist therapists in their efforts to improve patient fitness, mobility, and independence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process, nanosecond laser shock peening, requires a protective coating to combat the heat affect zone, and a confining medium to promote the shock waves. The research will investigate the ability of a femtosecond laser shock peening process, which has higher energy density, to achieve the same result without the need for the protective coating and confinement layer. Eliminating the coating and confinement layer will significantly reduce setup complexity and manufacturing costs. Knowledge gained on the fundamental physical mechanisms occurring during femtosecond laser peening will be leveraged to realize a higher resolution process capable of processing a broader range of materials than currently possible by nanosecond laser peening. This advanced manufacturing capability will contribute to the competitiveness of the US by finding application in the development of progressive precision instrumentation, 3D-printing technologies, biomedical implants, and micro-mechanical systems. In addition to providing graduate students with advanced manufacturing expertise, the research results will be integrated into both course modules and educational outreach activities aimed at underrepresented minorities to further encourage more qualified people into the manufacturing work force. <br/><br/>The research objective is to understand the fundamental mechanisms and limitations of femtosecond laser shock peening without a protective coating in an air environment.

A number of mechanisms that lead to cell damage have been identified, but organisms, i.e., living animals and plants, presumably die not because they run out of cells, but because of failures of much larger scale. Cellular failures spread into failure of tissues, organs and ultimately the organism.  This project focuses on the first intermediate step of this ordered collapse: the spread of failure from cells to tissues. To this end, the project will theoretically and experimentally establish the role of complex interactions between cells in aging tissues, using tissue engineering strategies to independently control both age and cell interactions.  Experiments will be supplemented by mathematical models and computer simulations that will output mortality curves (plots of probability of death with increasing age) and life expectancies of these tissues. Furthermore, the project will be able to quantify the relative importance of cellular scale aging processes compared to those stemming from larger scale interaction effects. In view of broader impacts, aging affects everyone. With steadily increasing life expectancy, there is an immediate need to better understand principles underlying aging to find ways to decrease age-related diseases. This project will offer a fresh view to the scientific and medical community on the multiple scales involved in aging, paving the way for new approaches to delay or reverse aging and help attain healthier old ages. The research findings will be disseminated to a broad audience, from middle school to undergraduate and graduate students, and to the local community, with specific emphasis on underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Activities include workshops for middle school girls, regional science fair projects for high school students and seminars at a local medical center.<br/><br/>Although there exist a number of theories on cell damage, very little is known about how microscopic failures cascade to macro scale failure of tissues, organs and ultimately the organism. The goal of this project is to bridge microscopic cell failure to macroscopic manifestations of aging, by theoretically and experimentally establishing the role of complex interdependence and interactions between cells in aging tissues. Based on strong preliminary data from the investigators' labs, it is hypothesized that aging, defined in terms of an increased probability of death with chronological age, is due to failures cascading through an interdependent network of cells, rather than a series of isolated cell failures. To test this hypothesis, the aims of this project are to 1) Fabricate 3D engineered heart tissues consisting of varying densities of (aged and young) single and multiple cell types of the heart tissue (cardiac fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells); 2) Age the tissue for a month, both with and without oxidative stress, while measuring the survival statistics of a population of tissues and cells within; and 3) Make inferences regarding the role of interactions using a detailed analytical theory. Specifically, the computational model studies spatial interdependence networks whose edge weights are determined by the diffusion equation and first order reaction kinetics. The nodes fail stochastically depending on their interaction with others, in a percolation-like spread. The computational framework will generate testable hypotheses for the proposed experiments, and in return, experimental measurements will constrain the model parameters. Project findings have the potential to transform aging research by introducing an entirely new view that aging is a universal attribute of any (living or non-living) system that has a sufficient number of components that strongly depend on one other to carry out their microscopic functions. Furthermore, this view enables, for the first time, the ability to quantify and simulate the progression of aging, given a certain interdependence network structure to predict how and when an interdependent system should be expected to catastrophically collapse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on the development of statistical methods for causal inference.  The first part of this project will develop a causal inference method for mediation analysis.  If a treatment has a beneficial effect on an outcome, it is often of interest to investigate what are the pathways by which it affects the outcome. Direct and indirect effects decompose the effect of a treatment into the part that is mediated by a covariate (the mediator) and the part that is not.  For example, in HIV/ AIDS research, it is important to estimate how much of the effect of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) on mother-to-child-transmission of HIV is mediated by the effect of ART treatment on the HIV viral load in the mother's blood.  In medicine, psychology, political science, and economics, differentiating between indirect and direct effects has become increasingly important.  Therefore, it is paramount that appropriate statistical methods are developed to estimate direct and indirect effects in a variety of settings, including the setting in which there are post-treatment common causes of the mediator and the outcome.  The second part of this project will compare confidence regions.  Recently, there has been extensive discussion in the statistical community about a move away from p-values.  P-values can lead researchers to conclude that a treatment has a significant effect even if that effect is very small, and clinically irrelevant.  Confidence regions are the obvious alternative to p-values, as they provide a range of values of the parameters of interest that are most consistent with the data.  While comparisons of p-values have been extensively researched and confidence regions are routinely reported, comparison of confidence regions has received relatively little attention.  In this project, confidence regions will be compared based on the notion of asymptotic equivalence.  <br/><br/>Natural direct and indirect effects use cross-worlds counterfactuals: outcomes under treatment with the mediator ""set"" to its value without treatment.  Cross-worlds counterfactuals can never be observed, as they involve quantities under two different treatments where only one treatment is given to any particular patient or unit.  The PI has recently proposed organic direct and indirect effects to avoid the use of cross-worlds counterfactuals.  Organic direct and indirect effects also apply when the mediator cannot be ""set"".  For example, the HIV viral load in the mother's blood cannot be set; if it could be set, doctors would set it to zero.  In the first part of this project, organic direct and indirect effects will be extended to settings with post-treatment common causes of the mediator and the outcome.  It will be shown that, in contrast to natural direct and indirect effects, estimators and confidence intervals can be developed in that setting for organic effects.  The second part of this project will compare confidence regions. Most work on the comparison of confidence regions has studied coverage probabilities, confidence interval length, and small sample properties. In this project, confidence regions will be compared for large samples, based on the asymptotic behavior of the Hausdorff distance between the different confidence regions. The Hausdorff distance between partly overlapping intervals is simply the maximum of the difference between the left limits and the right limits of the intervals. The Hausdorff distance has also been defined for non-convex sets and in higher dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A comprehensive technique that permits two independent methods of separation is used to analyze mixtures of volatiles. In addition, statistical procedures are defined to verify the accurate selection of marker compounds given various levels of sample complexity. These approaches may improve future studies on VOCs in forensic science, defense, and other natural science applications.

Chemical measurement of complex VOC matrices is analytically challenging because they are comprised of numerous compounds from different chemical classes, are highly varied in concentration, and have low matrix specificity. The specific aims of this study include the development of procedures for VOC method translation from a GC-MS instrument to a GCxGC-MS instrument using modulation retrofitting.  The research team also investigates GCxGC-MS chemometric feature selections on a reference VOC collection with simulated challenges and demonstrates the developed approach on real samples exhibiting high inter-sample VOC variation.

In particular, the flows considered in this project are differential equations that model how the shape of a geometric object changes as its area, volume, or some other geometric quantity decreases as rapidly as possible. For example, the surface area decreases most rapidly under the mean curvature flow (MCF), while the enclosed volume deceases most rapidly under the Gauss curvature flow (GCF).  Due to these natural decreasing properties, as the flow becomes singular (i.e., the object develops folds, corners, or other points of high curvature) these evolutions often tend (under magnification) toward optimal shapes minimizing the corresponding energies such as area and volume.  For example, a soap bubble is the shape of a rescaled singularity of the MCF. These energy minimizers appear not only in geometry, but also in economics and physics; for instance, optimal transport refers to a mapping from one area to another that minimizes an energy which is the total cost of resource allocation. Thus, studying singularity of the geometric flows sheds new insight on the?understanding of energy minimizers?in physics and economics.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand the singularity of various geometric flows including the Gauss curvature flow (GCF), the mean curvature flow (MCF), and the Ricci flow (RF).

The molecular nature of the changes that occur in the brain to alter behavior in a seasonal manner remains poorly understood. This project will examine epigenetic changes, i.e. changes in external modifications to DNA, that turn behavior-regulating genes on or off in a season-dependent manner. The work will be carried out using behavioral approaches and DNA sequencing of the genome of the long-distance migratory monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus. The monarch exhibits extreme seasonal behavioral changes at the individual level in response to changing daylength and temperature. Migratory monarch butterflies accomplish an extraordinary journey of 2,000 miles from the United States to their overwintering sites in Mexico by flying southward in the fall. In the spring, migratory butterflies flip their flight orientation northward and return to the United States. This project will reveal seasonal epigenetic changes to the genome in the brains of these seasonal forms. These findings will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying seasonal migration and the production of distinct seasonal flight orientations, and may be applicable to other migratory species. They could also have implications for conservation strategies to help preserve the iconic monarch migration, a spectacular yet threatened biological phenomenon. The project will provide valuable research training for students interested in animal behavior, neuroscience, and bioinformatics, including students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The researchers will also develop outreach activities devoted to increase public awareness for the need of monarch habitat conservation efforts.<br/><br/>Seasonal behavioral adaptations are key to the ecological success of many animals. The behavioral plasticity observed in individuals in response to seasonal changes in the environment strongly suggests that epigenetics play a crucial role in shaping seasonal behavior. However, the epigenetic changes that link brain function to seasonal regulation of behavior remain largely unknown. This project will leverage the remarkable seasonal plasticity of monarch butterfly migratory behavior in response to seasonal changes in the environment (daylength, temperature) to delineate the genome-wide epigenetic architecture in the brain that underlies seasonal migratory behavior and flight orientation. The goal of the project is to identify active cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and putative transcription factors (TFs) that mediate differential gene expression in the brains of non-migrants, fall migrants and spring remigrants. The researchers will use fall migrants and fall migrants reprogrammed into spring remigrants in controlled conditions and a combination of next-generation sequencing technologies. Genes differentially expressed in the brains of these seasonal forms will be identified by RNA-seq, and open genomic regulatory regions and CREs that mediate this differential expression will be identified by ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq of histone marks. Candidate transcription factors (TFs) responsible for the seasonal behavioral reprogramming will ultimately be identified through DNA genomic footprinting within CREs. The project will have broad societal impacts through outreach activities devoted to increase public awareness for the need of monarch habitat conservation efforts, and research training of students interested in animal behavior, neuroscience, and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These constraints are often imposed by real-world data, but it is frequently the case that the relevant data is not completely known to the agent performing the optimization; it is natural to model such settings using probability distributions associated with the data. In such analyses, the constraints associated with the optimization problem are now themselves ""stochastic,"" and a standard goal is to maximize the likelihood of satisfying all the constraints while incurring minimum cost. (As a motivating example, an airline may wish to operate as few flights as possible while ensuring that with 99% probability, no passenger is bumped.)  Apart from modeling uncertainty, optimization with stochastic constraints also provides a way to succinctly model constraints whose standard description is very large; design problems in voting theory, where there are very many voters, are examples of this kind.  This project studies both of these kinds of problems, called stochastic design problems, from a unified new perspective based on techniques from computational complexity theory. The project also trains graduate students who will achieve fluency both in complexity theory and in optimization, and will promote cross-disciplinary activities between operations research and theoretical computer science. <br/> <br/>The motivating insight which underlies this project is that Boolean function analysis -- a topic at the intersection of harmonic analysis, probability theory, and complexity theory -- provides a useful suite of techniques for stochastic design problems. The investigators will study two broad topics. The first one is on chance-constrained optimization:  In problems of this sort, one is given a set of stochastic constraints and the aim is to satisfy all the constraints with at least a certain fixed threshold probability. While previous work on such problems has typically achieved computationally efficient algorithms by relaxing the actual set of constraints, the investigators will focus on algorithms which exactly satisfy the original given set of stochastic constraints. This line of work will address the chance-constrained versions of fundamental optimization problems such as bin packing, knapsack, and linear programming. The second broad topic is that of inverse problems in social choice theory:  Game theorists use so-called ""power indices"" to measure the influence of voters in voting schemes. A basic algorithmic problem is to design efficient algorithms for the inverse problem, in which, given a set of prescribed power indices, the goal is to construct a voting game with these indices. The investigators will study questions such as (a) to what extent is a given voting scheme specified by its power indices? (b) what is the complexity of exactly reconstructing an unknown target voting game given its power indices? (c) when and to what extent is reconstruction possible in a partial information setting?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concept of shrinkage is important because it provides an elegant framework for combining information from related populations and often leads to substantial improvements in the performances of algorithms used for simultaneous inference. Driven by applications in a wide range of scientific problems over the last decade, the traditional roles of statistical shrinkage have rapidly evolved as new perspectives have been introduced to address and exploit complex, latent structural properties of modern datasets. These new applications often involve non-standard inferential attributes such as asymmetric predictive objectives as well as intricate modeling caveats, such as nonexchangeable prior structures and censored observations. These new age statistical problems pose challenges not only in developing flexible shrinkage algorithms but also in optimally tuning them to obtain efficient shrinkage properties. This project will develop new empirical Bayes predictive methods that possess optimal shrinkage properties and can produce significant enhancements over existing algorithms built on the mathematical convenience of symmetric loss functions and exchangeable prior structures.<br/><br/>The common theme underlying this project is that of using optimal shrinkage properties to develop efficient predictive methods. Existing shrinkage algorithms rely heavily on decision theoretic identities that break down under asymmetry and nonexchangeability, and so, there is an urgent need to develop new statistical methodologies, theories, and algorithms. The PI will develop new conditionally linear decision rules for prediction under asymmetry in nonexchangeable Gaussian hierarchical models and will extend the proposed methodologies to non-Gaussian models as well as to settings with non-linear structural constraints. Additionally, optimal empirical Bayes rules will be developed that will work with censored data and can be used for prediction in multi-stage decision making scenarios with asymmetric objectives. The results developed in this project will provide practitioners with an improved understanding of where existing prediction approaches fail under asymmetry, censoring, and nonexchangeability and why algorithms specifically developed to operate under these conditions should be used.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such eco-evolutionary processes may also lead to unpredictable changes in biological systems. The application of herbicides, for example, causes a range of responses in plants such as death, stunted growth, or the alteration of flowering times of survivors. Plant populations exposed to herbicide often evolve resistance. It is not known if these herbicide-induced changes can affect other key ecological components of a community such as plant-pollinator interactions. This research will examine the potential for cascading eco-evolutionary effects of herbicide application within crop associated weed communities. The researchers will take advantage of the impending widespread application of the novel herbicide dicamba. The work is specifically designed to capture the initial dynamics of dicamba's use in agriculture. This research will focus on the crop-associated weed community and its interaction with insect pollinators. Ultimately, this project has broad implications for the health and resilience of agricultural systems following human-mediated influences. The evolution of these wild species may have substantial effects on agricultural sustainability, the economics of food production, and human health.<br/><br/>The eco-evolutionary forces studied here are likely to create evolutionary responses that lead to significant ecological change. An understanding of these phenomena is incomplete, however, as few natural systems have so far been examined for direct links between evolving traits and ecological impacts. Moreover, the initial dynamics in such systems are rarely captured. The proposed research takes advantage of the upcoming widespread application of a new herbicide to study its cascading effects on ecological and evolutionary processes in crop-associated weed communities, including important natural pollinators. This work will test four hypotheses concerning the initial ecological and evolutionary processes. Ecological processes to be studied include the role of phenotypic plasticity in invasion dynamics and changes in pollinator abundances and diversity. Evolutionary processes include plant species losses and reductions in genetic diversity. The work will use a combination of field studies and genetic analyses to capture the initial processes in a dynamic that is expected to proceed very rapidly. This research will provide key insight into a critical stage of eco-evolutionary processes that occur at the agro-ecological interface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators apply the Categorization Elaboration Model (CEM) to investigate why simply including women or racial/ethnic minorities on engineering teams does not lead automatically to greater innovation. The model reconciles the inconsistent literature on team diversity and team performance and addresses the fundamental question of when and how team diversity can have a positive relationship with various indicators of performance such as creativity, innovation, team effectiveness, and performance. The study adds to the research literature by explicitly linking types of team diversity with innovation; simultaneously examining team dynamics, team microclimate, and team cognition to highlight factors that facilitate or impede innovation in diverse teams; adding temporal elements by collecting data over a two-year period; and examining the diversity-innovation process among teams of working engineers in the field. Investigators will use variables such as the value, radicalness, and number of a development team?s patents in emergent technologies.  The research findings will influence organizational practices within engineering firms by identifying specific team dynamics and microclimates that facilitate innovation goal achievement by diverse teams.<br/><br/>The project is a large scale quantitative survey linking team diversity and team dynamics to team performance and metrics of innovation, primarily patents. The study will collect data from 5,234 engineering alumni who participated in a prior NSF funded longitudinal study about contextual barriers that impact persistence in engineering careers. It will investigate four research questions: (1) What conditions must be in place to facilitate/hinder demographically and informationally diverse teams to produce innovative solutions? (2) What are the underlying mechanisms by which demographically and informationally diverse teams produce innovative solutions? (3) What are the underlying mechanisms that explain the relationship between demographically and informationally diverse teams, information, discussion process, and innovation? and (4) How do these processes vary over the study period of two years?  The CEM hypothesizes that it is not direct relationships between gender and racially diverse teams and innovation but factors within the team and team dynamics that influence the relationship between diversity and innovation.

The first set of goals seeks relatively simple solutions to economic design problems that provably approximate the theoretical optimum. The project includes two new directions for this area: the design of simple contracts for principal agent settings, and the design of resale-proof revenue-maximizing auctions.  The second set of goals investigates the question of how to best learn near-optimal auctions from data, focusing on the important but unresolved algorithmic and strategic issues of the problem.  The third set of goals develops complexity-theoretic barriers in economics, with specific applications to equilibria in markets with divisible goods, to extended formulations for the polytope of interim allocation rules, and to the inherent complexity of optimal prior-free digital goods auctions.

The uncertainty and societal impact of this acceleration underscores the need for an improved understanding of relationships between regional sea level and climate. High-resolution sea level proxies spanning the past ~2,000 years (the ""Common Era"") reveal century-scale, decimeter-amplitude (up to ~20-cm), variability along the east coast associated with changes in dynamic sea level (DSL). These changes offer a unique benchmark for climate models, and the closest observational analog for climate-driven sea level change expected in the 21st century. This project will employ statistical and dynamical models to improve the scientific understanding of Common Era sea level changes along the east coast and their relationship with climate. The research team will leverage this knowledge to inform projections of 21st century DSL change and the ability of current-generation climate models to capture those changes, in turn informing coastal resilience efforts along the high-risk eastern North American coast. The project will provide funding and opportunities for an early career scientist and a graduate student to develop a diverse set of skills and collaborators in paleoclimate, climate modeling, and weather and climate risk assessment.<br/><br/>The project team will confront the sparsity of the proxy record and the limitations of current-generation paleoclimate simulations by testing hypotheses about the drivers of sea level variability using a broad statistically- and dynamically-based modeling strategy. Project tasks include: (1) a rigorous assessment of the robustness of regional DSL reconstructions generated with a hierarchical spatio-temporal statistical framework; (2) leveraging the statistical framework to assess linkages between DSL and other climate indices (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, sea surface temperature and salinity, Intertropical Convergence Zone position); and (3) conducting and analyzing coupled climate model simulations. Climate model simulations will be forced by proxy-derived surface fluxes and validated by a synthesis of complementary climate reconstructions. The simulations will reveal the dynamical mechanisms underlying correlations found in reconstructions and demonstrate whether relationships observed in the instrumental record persist over multidecadal-to-centennial timescales. The research is expected to lead to a more complete interpretation of Common Era sea level and climate variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, sometimes when organizations attempt to make their hiring, evaluation, and promotion processes meritocratic, their employees, consumers, and the public resist these changes. While there are numerous theories that suggest what might underlie such backlash, there is little evidence of what causes it. This project asks what produces backlash to gender diversity initiatives and which factors can reduce backlash. The project will address a fundamental social psychological question: which factors can override the psychological tendency for individuals to defend their group status and the status quo when either appears to be threatened? Findings of this project can help organizational leaders increase buy-in as they attempt to implement changes that will reduce workplace gender inequity and make their firms more meritocratic. <br/><br/>The study derives hypotheses from diverse sociological and psychological literatures, including group position theory, system justification theory, moral foundations theory, and identity control theory. Hypotheses suggest that messaging that provides data illustrating the extent of the gender inequality or its illegitimacy, minimizes threat to male group position, justifies the intervention using particular moral values (like loyalty and respect) or business motivations, or frames the intervention as influencing rather than adjusting the organizational practices, will be more successful in garnering support for the initiative compared to messaging that does not. Using six original experiments, the project determines whether and among whom support for an organizational gender intervention increases if its announcement: (1) provides data illustrating the extent of the gender inequality; (2) provides evidence that the gender inequality is illegitimate; (3) reduces threat against male group position; (4) justifies the intervention using particular moral values; (5) justifies the intervention using business motivations rather than moral motivations; and (6) frames the intervention as influencing or adjusting the organizational practices. Subjects will be recruited from a nationally representative sample, thus enhancing the external validity of the findings.

At present, global climate models do a poor job of predicting recent observed declines in Arctic sea ice, and the causes of this discrepancy remain unclear. One interpretation is that models may not be sensitive enough to capture the response of sea ice to greenhouse warming. However, another possibility is that natural cycles have accelerated the recent Arctic sea ice loss. Solving this problem has important implications not only for the interpretation of recent Arctic climate change but also the future projection for the Arctic, including the question as to when we will see the first ice free summer in the Arctic. The study will conduct targeted simulations and place these simulations in the context of observations over the last 117 years. As a result, we expect to better understand how well models capture naturally occurring variations of the Arctic climate and sea ice, and how we can improve models to yield more confident predictions. In addition, the study will train a graduate student and a postdoctoral scientist in polar aspects of climate science and general climate modeling and will provide outreach activities targeting K-12 students and teachers in Santa Barbara. <br/><br/>This project will help us understand and quantify how  atmospheric circulation in the Arctic influences winds, cloudiness, water vapor, radiation and thereby sea ice variability. It will lead to better understanding of the relative contribution of forced and internal variaiblities in recent Arctic warming and sea ice loss. First, the investigators will use data assimilation techniques in a global earth system model and explore how tropical sea surface temperature contributes to the recent sea ice decline via teleconnections to the high latitudes. The investigators will then examine dynamical mechanisms that link Arctic circulation to remote drivers in the tropics and put circulation changes over the last 40 years into the context of longer centennial term changes. Finally, results will help evaluate model skill for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and determine whether the tropical drivers represent a main source of modeled internal variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Seasonal and longer-term predictions of flooding along the Mississippi and its major tributaries remain a major challenge because the effects of climate variability, greenhouse forcing, and human modifications of the river are difficult to disentangle using short records from gauging stations that span less than 150 years. This project will develop records describing the timing and magnitude of flooding across the Mississippi River basin over the last millennium, and use these records to understand the influence of climate variability on flood activity. This work will improve predictions of flooding along the Mississippi River, a hazard that affects millions of people. The findings will be useful for planned and ongoing efforts to slow coastal land loss in the Mississippi River delta. The project will engage students at three institutions in research, and its findings will be disseminated to the public through an exhibit at the Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to reconstruct the frequency and magnitude of overbank floods along the lower Mississippi River and its major tributaries over the last millennium using the sedimentary archives preserved in oxbow lakes.

This project offers new knowledge for addressing this challenge via fundamental research on a novel method that entails rapidly producing flakes or nanosheets of two-dimensional materials by employing high-pressure gas flow. Unlike the wide assortment of existing methods that require time based treatment, this new two-dimensional material nanomanufacturing process is rapid and continuous, thus providing the high throughput production capacity demanded by plant-based manufacturing. In addition, this process is environmentally friendly and produces materials of quality that is either better than or comparable to those produced by existing methods. The results of this work advances the nation's prosperity and security by boosting competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing efforts on the international stage and promoting broader adoption of two-dimensional materials into next-generation nanotechnology-enabled products. The project is multidisciplinary and involves manufacturing, fluid dynamics, computational simulations, and materials science. Several graduate and undergraduate students are trained in these disciplines through this project. The research  multidisciplinary approach and outreach activities jointly help in broadening participation of women and underrepresented minority students in advanced research and significantly impact engineering education.<br/><br/>Compressible flow exfoliation produces few layered two-dimensional (2D) materials in a continuous manner using a high-pressure multiphase gas flowing through a narrow orifice, followed by collection in a suitable solvent. This project fills the knowledge gap on the mechanisms and scalability of exfoliation in the presence of a rapidly expanding gaseous phase. In particular, it contributes to the knowledge of how 2D materials interact and fragment in the presence of high shear and shockwaves. This research involves performing process experiments guided by gas dynamics principles and computational fluid dynamic simulations that test the high shear rate exfoliation hypothesis. Throughput, yield and flake quality of the processed 2D materials are optimized and their link to the gas, particle and post-processing colloid characteristics are established. The feasibility of the compressible flow exfoliation approach are demonstrated by integrating the processed 2D materials into next-generation nanotechnology-enabled systems such as gas-barrier nanocomposite films and electrically conductive inks for printable electronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Massive ice shelves buttress marine terminating glaciers, slowing the rate that land ice reaches the sea and, in turn, restraining the rate of sea level rise. To date, most work has focused on the destabilizing impacts of warmer air and water temperatures, resulting in melting that thins and weakens ice shelves. However, recent findings indicate that sea ice does not protect ice shelves from wave impacts as much as previously thought, which has raised the possibility that tsunamis and other ocean waves could affect shelf stability. This project will assess the potential for increased shelf fracturing from the impact of tsunamis and from heightened wave activity due to climate-driven changes in storm patterns and reduced sea-ice extent by developing models to investigate how wave impacts damage ice shelves. The modeling effort will allow for regional comparisons between large and small ice shelves, and provide an evaluation of the impacts of changing climate and storm patterns on ice shelves, ice sheets, glaciers, and, ultimately, sea level rise. This project will train graduate students in mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary approaches to Earth and ocean sciences.<br/><br/>This project takes a four-pronged approach to estimating the impact of vibrations on ice shelves at the grounding zone due to tsunamis, very long period, infragravity, and storm-driven waves. First, the team will use high-resolution tsunami modeling to investigate the response of ice shelves along the West Antarctic coast to waves originating in different regions of the Pacific Ocean. Second, it will compare the response to wave impacts on grounding zones of narrow and wide ice shelves. Third, it will assess the exposure risk due to storm forcing through a reanalysis of weather and wave model data; and, finally, the team will model the propagation of ocean-wave-induced vibrations in the ice from the shelf front to and across the grounding zone. In combination, this project aims to identify locations along the Antarctic coast that are subject to enhanced, bathymetrically-focused, long-period ocean-wave impacts. Linkages between wave impacts and climate arise from potential changes in sea-ice extent in front of shelves, and changes in the magnitude, frequency, and tracks of storms. Understanding the effects of ocean waves and climate on ice-shelf integrity is critical to anticipate their contribution to the amplitude and timing of sea-level rise. Wave-driven reductions in ice-shelf stability may enhance shelf fragmentation and iceberg calving, reducing ice shelf buttressing and eventually accelerating sea-level rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here, because the resolution of any radar depends heavily on the stability of its interrogating signal, the quality of the internal oscillator that generates this signal is among the most important determinants of radar performance. It is for this reason that the most capable radars use frequency signal generators based on 'Poseidon' oscillators that derive their stability from bulky (and expensive) sapphire-loaded cavity resonators. However, the size and cost of this approach restricts it to use in large non-portable applications. The research herein breaks this paradigm by recognizing that an oscillator referenced to an ensemble of tiny mechanically resonant structures constructed in diamond material can potentially equal and perhaps outperform a Poseidon oscillator, all in a substantially smaller form factor. Indeed, sizes small enough to enable high-resolution personal radar might be within reach, and this could enable a host of new personal capabilities, including ranging, remote location services, and local area sensing to identify opportunities, e.g., sales on interesting items, favorite foods, etc., as one walks past them.<br/><br/>The research specifically explores parametric mechanical frequency division using micromechanical resonators and sub-20-nanometer electrode-to-resonator gaps that together propel the short-term stability and figure-of-merit of oscillators towards that of the best radar oscillators, but in substantially smaller size. Here, tiny electrode-to-resonator gaps enabled by advances in nanofabrication technology increase the electromechanical coupling of capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical resonators to ranges that support gigaHertz oscillators, all while retaining their record-setting quality factors, both of which drive down phase noise and power consumption. Sub-20-nanometer gaps also permit wider frequency tuning, as well as the use of parametric excitation at higher resonance frequencies, which in turn enables mechanical approaches to reducing phase noise further via a combination of frequency division and close-to-carrier filtering, all with nearly no power penalty. While gap reduction enables unprecedented micromechanical resonator and oscillator performance, it also elucidates fundamental physical limitations expected to manifest more prominently at the nano-scale, including nonlinear noise multiplication, undue injection locking, Casimir forces, enhanced (unwanted) acceleration sensitivity, and less resilience against finite fabrication tolerances and stress. While possibly detrimental to performance, these physical limitations open fertile ground for scientific study. Indeed, lessons learned by modeling the influence of nonlinearity on oscillator limiting and phase noise are likely key to propelling micromechanical oscillators into the stated higher end applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These data possess distinct characteristics compared with traditional low-dimensional or low-order data and pose unprecedented challenges to the statistical community. Dimension reduction often becomes the crucial first step in order to better summarize, visualize, and analyze high-dimensional high-order data. One natural approach is to unfold high-order data into matrices, followed by the use of well-established matrix dimension reduction methods. However, such operations often lead to loss of information on the intrinsic data structures and sub-optimal statistical results of subsequent analyses.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Clancy Blair at New York University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the social skill development of children growing up in environments of socioeconomic adversity. Nearly 20% of children in the United States are being raised in poverty. Impoverished families face a multitude of adversities, such as economic and housing obstacles, as well as difficulties seeking and maintaining employment. Such barriers can produce psychological stress and diminish time for family interactions and children's social skill development. The attainment of appropriate social skills is important for children's development across many areas of functioning, including mental health and academic achievement. Children with poor social skills are at higher risk for exhibiting violence, sexual offenses, and criminal behaviors in adolescence or adulthood. Despite the increased risk of poor social adjustment associated with living in poverty, some children exposed to poverty-related adversity have positive social adjustment. One finding that has consistently been linked to their resiliency is the presence of supportive adult-child relationships. The proposed studies will assess if quality peer relationships provide the same benefits that quality adult-child relationships provide in impoverished populations, by improving social development and biological regulation (i.e. stress physiology) despite exposure to poverty-related adversity. The studies are driven by the critical need to create readily accessible and scalable interventions to promote optimal social development for at-risk impoverished children.<br/><br/>The proposed research utilizes an innovative cross-species human/rodent approach to explore peer relationship quality as a potential target for interventions aimed at promoting social skill and stress physiology resiliency in at-risk, impoverished children. To this end, the proposed studies will draw on existing data from the Family Life Project, a longitudinal sample of 1,292 human children recruited at birth (oversampled for poverty status), in order to complete longitudinal modeling related to the impact of poverty-related adversity on social skills and stress physiology, and the mediating role of peer relationships. The proposed research will also leverage a scarcity-adversity rodent model to study neurobiological mechanisms by which resource scarcity impacts the development of social behavior, and test interventions of neurobehavioral repair grounded in social learning theory. These interventions will aim to improve the quality of peer interactions via naturalistic and pharmacological manipulations. This research will inform the creation of targeted, sensitive, and scalable interventions for the improvement of child social skill development in high-risk environments<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Mara River is the only permanent source of water for wildlife and is therefore considered the 'life blood' of the Serengeti. This proposal focuses on the effects of nutrient addition to the river ecosystem from natural and exceedingly large inputs of nutrients from hippopotamus and wildebeest. The key question is how do large and irregularly timed nutrient inputs affect the way river ecosystems function? This project will conduct a series of experiments in the Mara river system to address this question. Results of this project will produce estimates of the distribution and abundance of hippos, and the location and magnitude of wildebeest drowning events that will provide important information for the management of hippos and wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem. Hippos and wildebeest are extremely important to the tourism economy of Kenya and Tanzania and are species of considerable conservation concern. A collaboration with the National Museums of Kenya will provide important data on the diversity and biomass of insects and fish in the Mara River. This project will train a postdoctoral associate, a graduate student, and multiple undergraduate students, and broaden participation of under-represented groups in science by involving underrepresented minority undergraduate students in summer research. This project will also provide field-based short courses in Kenya for US students. Finally, results from this research will be shared with global audiences through web-based outreach initiatives using real-time discharge data, live photo streams from the field, and Twitter and blog updates.<br/><br/>The movement of energy, materials, and organisms across ecosystem boundaries is a common feature of many landscapes. These spatial subsidies have strong but variable effects on communities and ecosystems. The magnitude of spatial subsidies may be one of the most important drivers of the variability in community and ecosystem level effects. Theory suggests that low levels of inputs stabilize food webs and increase community persistence, particularly when complementing patterns of local productivity, and high levels of inputs decrease food web stability and increase the strength of trophic cascades. Very little empirical research has addressed the impacts of the magnitude of subsidies, raising the central question of this proposal: how does the magnitude of subsidies influence community and ecosystem processes? The Mara River sustains the largest remaining overland migration of around 1.2 million wildebeest and a population of over 4,000 hippopotamus (hippos). Hippos, through excretion and egestion during daily feeding migrations, and wildebeest, through carcass inputs during mass drownings, create a natural gradient of increasing subsidy inputs from upstream to downstream in the Mara River. This project utilizes basin-wide comparisons, in situ comparative experiments, and small-scale artificial stream experiments to test how the magnitude of spatial subsidies influences primary and secondary production, the strength of trophic cascades, and food web stability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the one hand, many biologists maintain that the flexibility to change appearance, behavior or physiology are of no relevance to evolution, because evolution requires genetic change. On the other hand, a growing number of researchers have suggested that such flexibility plays a critical role in evolution by jump-starting genetic change. This research will help resolve this controversy by investigating whether changes in appearance, behavior and/or physiology precede (and enable) the evolutionary origins of major, new, genetically-encoded features. The research will specifically evaluate whether pre-existing, diet-induced flexibility has contributed to the evolution of a novel, complex body form in spadefoot frogs. Thus, not only will this research provide important insights into the evolutionary process, it will also shed new light onto one of biology's enduring mysteries: how complex features originate. The research will also promote educational outreach by training school children and undergraduate students and by organizing public talks at museums.<br/><br/>This research will test the Plasticity-First hypothesis of adaptive evolution. To do so, the proposed research will focus on spadefoot toads. Like most frogs, tadpoles in the genus Scaphiopus develop only into a typical 'omnivore' morph. By contrast, tadpoles in the genus Spea exhibit striking plasticity: depending on their diet, they develop into either omnivores or a novel 'carnivore' morph. Interestingly, certain components of this distinctive carnivore morph can be diet-induced in Scaphiopus. Moreover, some Spea populations have secondarily lost the omnivore-carnivore plasticity and become monomorphic. Indeed, in some populations, selection has favored the near fixation of the carnivore morph. Thus, as a group, spadefoots appear to represent different stages in the evolution of the novel carnivore morph: from its possible initial induction (in Scaphiopus), to its refinement as part of a novel developmental 'switch' (in many Spea populations), to its ultimate fixation (in some Spea populations). The planned research will evaluate whether this novel carnivore phenotype arose through plasticity-first evolution by contrasting development, genetic variation, and performance in different species/populations that serve as different evolutionary stages in the origins of this distinctive form. In doing so, the research will evaluate the critical predictions of the plasticity-first hypothesis. This research will thereby help to clarify plasticity's role in evolutionary innovation and provide a roadmap for others to test the plasticity-first hypothesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge arises especially in middle school and high school algebra; far too often, students in algebra courses come away with only a moderate level of skill at procedures (e.g., equation solving) with almost no conceptual understanding of why these procedures work. This lack of deep understanding is unfortunate, because algebra is an important stepping stone to advanced mathematics as well as to future educational and employment opportunities. Thus, there is a great need for algebra instruction that helps students acquire well-integrated knowledge of key concepts and problem-solving procedures. This project tackles this issue using, as a platform, a software-based intelligent tutoring system that will extend an existing tutoring system for algebra. The new, enhanced tutoring system will support both practice in solving equations and new conceptually-oriented algebra activities. It will provide detailed and targeted guidance that adapts to individual students' errors, strategies, and developing algebra knowledge. Lab-based and classroom studies will investigate three key questions: (1) What mix of conceptual and procedural activities best helps students acquire deep skill and conceptual knowledge of algebra? (2) How frequently should students shift back and forth between the two types of activities? (3) How effective is the new tutoring system compared to commonly-used software, namely, Khan Academy, or a standard intelligent tutoring system that provides procedural practice only? The project will lead to new knowledge about how to create effective instruction for middle school and high school algebra, together with new intelligent tutoring software that embodies this knowledge.<br/><br/>Based on past research, it is commonly accepted that in many domains, gains in conceptual knowledge can lead to gains in procedural knowledge, and vice versa. Further, there is some evidence that instruction that shifts back and forth between conceptually-oriented activities and procedurally-oriented activities is especially effective. However, it is not yet known what sorts of activities best support the development of conceptual knowledge, or how they should be integrated with activities that target learning of procedures so that students might make connections between the two. To address these issues, the project will extend existing tutoring system for equation solving (called Lynnette) with conceptual activities, based on past research that suggests that worked examples, self-explanation, visual representations (namely, bar diagrams), and activation of prior knowledge can be effective for promoting gains in conceptual knowledge. In doing so, this will leverage an established technical infrastructure for intelligent tutoring systems research and development, called CTAT/Tutorshop. The project will conduct two lab studies and two classroom studies to investigate what mix of conceptually-oriented activities is the most effective complement to the system's current set of procedurally-oriented activities, how frequently students should shift back and forth between procedurally- and conceptually-oriented activities, and how effective the resulting tutoring system is, compared to two control conditions in which students work with commonly used types of software for algebra learning (Khan Academy and Lynnette). The project will generate new knowledge about how to design effective instruction that helps students acquire well-integrated conceptual and procedural knowledge that is effective in real educational settings. This knowledge could lead to better, more conceptually-oriented instruction in algebra, and it has the potential to improve instruction in other STEM learning environments. The project will also create a new intelligent tutoring system for algebra that is much more effective than current systems. The system will be made available to teachers and schools free of charge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports fundamental theoretical and experimental research on heterogeneous aggregation, or heteroaggregation, as a method for nanomanufacturing of core/satellite nanoparticles consisting of a core nanorod covered by a shell of many smaller satellite nanoparticles of a different composition. Heteroaggregation is a simple approach, based on mixing solvents with different properties to drive the assembly of pre-synthesized nanoparticles. This method is readily scalable to large volumes. Use of externally applied magnetic fields to align nanorod cores coated with magnetic satellite nanoparticles has potential applications in advanced pigments, mechanical strengthening of composite materials, and biomedical imaging. Advances in these applications impact national prosperity and security. This research enables new capabilities for nanomanufacturing by developing methods and strategies for conducting, modeling, and characterizing heteroaggregation processes and magnetic alignment that can be applied to other systems spanning a wide range of material compositions and length scales. Education and outreach activities are planned to educate students and teachers in nanoscience and nanotechnology and engage women and under-represented minority students in research and nanomanufacturing training.<br/><br/>Nanomanufacturing of multifunctional nanoparticles remains challenging due to limitations in seeded growth and self-assembly processes. This research aims to overcome these challenges by creating a theoretical and experimental framework for heteroaggregation. Controlling the solvent conditions and the compositions, sizes, and concentrations of the core and satellite nanoparticles drives heteroaggregation in forming uniform core/satellite nanoparticles, while avoiding homoaggregation of either the core or the satellite nanoparticles. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to predict the conditions for heteroaggregation of core/satellite nanoparticles, which comprehensively guide experiments and interpret results. For selected systems, the scalability of heteroaggregation for nanomanufacturing is investigated in both batch processes and continuous microfluidics. The understanding of magnetic alignment of core/satellite nanorods is achieved through molecular dynamics simulations and experimental verification. Dipolar interactions among magnetic satellite nanoparticles are predicted to provide torque for magnetic alignment, and it is important to establish the conditions under which sufficient torque is generated to drive magnetic alignment. Magnetic alignment imparts new properties for the heteroaggregates such as magneto-optical, polarization and microrheology, and elastic modulus for nanocomposites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, the discovery of new or improved catalysts has great practical importance, contributes to the economic viability of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and provides new ways of efficiently using scarce resources. In biological systems enzymes are exceedingly efficient at carrying out chemical reactions that are important to life. In fact, enzymes are often much more efficient than laboratory or industrial catalysts. Because of this they can be very useful guides in the design of new catalysts. Dr. Douglas B. Grotjahn and Dr. Andrew L. Cooksy, San Diego State University, supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, use enzyme inspired design principles to prepare and improve catalysts for industrial processes. A focus of their work is on new catalysts to convert components found in natural gas to more complex, valuable chemicals by routes that do not generate waste. This grant also supports the training of young investigators in the field of catalysis. The PIs and the students involved in the project maintain an outreach program to local high schools in order to encourage students to continue their study of science.<br/><br/>This research uses enzyme design principlse, particularly hydrogen bonding and proton transfer, to accelerate organometallic catalysis and reactions by new mechanisms. Ligands containing proton-donating or hydrogen-bonding groups are synthesized and combined with a variety of metal precursors to form metal complexes. Interactions with nonpolar and polar reactants, intermediates, or transition states create faster catalysts. The focus is mostly on waste-free addition or isomerization reactions, with several goals: (1) apply computer-based molecular predictions before and after catalyst discovery; (2) build and apply a toolbox of alkene isomerization catalysts; (3) use ligands to enable X-H activation; (4) develop catalysts for addition reactions; (5) create catalysts from cheaper metals of the first row of the periodic table. The project includes significant one-on-one training in modern techniques of organic and organometallic chemistry, including NMR spectroscopy, catalysis screening, and computation. The proposed research adds new mechanistic insight to our picture of bifunctional catalysis, using complementary experimental and computational studies to allow the design of better catalysts and chemical processes. To broaden public understanding of the computational chemistry an outreach program provides 8-12th graders an individualized introduction to 3D molecular visualization. The lesson plans are developed in partnership with teachers to reflectlearning objectives articulated by the State. Graduate students contribute to developing visualizations of catalytic reactions and participatd as discussion leaders and mentors during the visits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will approach the problem using techniques from distributed computing theory and other branches of theoretical computer science. This project has the potential to improve our understanding of computation in the brain, by identifying key problems that are solved in the brain and key mechanisms that may be used to solve them.  This work can also have impact on theoretical computer science, by contributing a new and fruitful direction for theoretical study. This collaboration between MIT and the Weizmann Institute in Israel will increase the participation of women and minority participants in this field and will seek to bridge the gap between computer scientists and biology researchers.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project develops an algorithmic theory for brain networks, based on novel stochastic Spiking Neural Network models with general interconnection patterns. It defines a collection of abstract problems to be solved by these networks, inspired by problems that are solved in actual brains, such as problems of focus, recognition, learning, and memory.  The project designs algorithms (networks) that solve the problems, and analyze them in terms of static costs such as network size, and dynamic costs such as time to converge to a correct solution.  The investigators consider tradeoffs between the various costs, and will prove corresponding lower bound results.

Historic flooding of the lower Mississippi in 2011 caused over $3 billion in agricultural losses and damage to infrastructure, with additional losses to flooding occurring again in 2016 and 2018. Seasonal and longer-term predictions of flooding along the Mississippi and its major tributaries remain a major challenge because the effects of climate variability, greenhouse forcing, and human modifications of the river are difficult to disentangle using short records from gauging stations that span less than 150 years. This project will develop records describing the timing and magnitude of flooding across the Mississippi River basin over the last millennium, and use these records to understand the influence of climate variability on flood activity. This work will improve predictions of flooding along the Mississippi River, a hazard that affects millions of people. The findings will be useful for planned and ongoing efforts to slow coastal land loss in the Mississippi River delta. The project will engage students at three institutions in research, and its findings will be disseminated to the public through an exhibit at the Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium.<br/><br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to reconstruct the frequency and magnitude of overbank floods along the lower Mississippi River and its major tributaries over the last millennium using the sedimentary archives preserved in oxbow lakes.

However, there are continued challenges in linking the differences in plant genomes to specific traits.  The lack of tools to study epigenetic variation, heritable variation that is not due to changes in DNA sequence, limits our ability to predict plant traits such as seed size and yield.  This project is developing novel tools and approaches for studying the role of epigenetic variation in corn.  These tools require developing a system for targeted editing of genes that regulate epigenetic variation in plants, enabling insights into the role of epigenetic variation in crop development.  The outcomes of this project will provide breakthrough technologies to improve corn and other crops.<br/><br/>The proposed research is focused on development of biological materials to study the role of DNA methylation in maize.  Prior work has suggested that DNA methylation is required for proper development of maize.  This project will characterize the genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in callus of maize in order to document any changes in this cell type.  Genome editing approaches will be utilized to create loss-of-function mutations in three key DNA methylation pathways in cell culture.  These cell lines can then be used to document changes in gene or transposable element expression to provide insights into the roles of DNA methylation in regulation of expression.  Several enzymes known to play roles in demethylation of DNA will also be over-expressed in callus tissue in an attempt to generate partial, or locus-specific, reductions in DNA methylation.  Attempts will be made to recover plants containing the loss-of-function mutations or over-expressing DNA demethylases that would be used to study the effects of these changes in vegetative plant tissues.  The materials generated by this project may provide novel resources for understanding the role of DNA methylation in a species with a large, complex crop genome.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In doing so, we will advance understanding of (i) how logjams affect water quality and stream communities in forested watersheds, (ii) the effects of historical and continuing human alteration of river corridors in forested regions, and (iii) how to design artificial logjams in rivers to manage stream temperature, nutrients, and aquatic communities. Our work will be shared with resource managers and practitioners to help with issues associated with river management and restoration. Student participation will include (i) K-12 students via course materials that will be developed in collaboration with elementary school teachers; (ii) undergraduate students involved in field data collection and analysis, including students from diverse backgrounds; and (iii) graduate students responsible for the primary data analysis and interpretation, who will have the opportunity to work with and mentor the undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>The benefits of large wood (LW) in river corridors are numerous, including the potential to enhance hyporheic exchange flow (HEF). Existing work has focused on HEF near single logs or single logjams. However, natural channels in forested regions with minimal human alteration commonly contain abundant dispersed LW pieces and multiple logjams spaced irregularly along the channel. We have little indication of whether multiple channel-spanning logjams produce an additive or nonlinear effect on HEF, but these alternatives have important implications for understanding river ecosystem function and for river management and restoration. Our primary objective is to quantify how HEF changes with increasing channel heterogeneity associated with channel-spanning logjams. We will use field measurements, physical experiments, and numerical models to evaluate the characteristics of HEF associated with different spatial densities of channel-spanning logjams. We expect nonlinear relations between logjams and HEF to result from increased bedforms such as pools that maximize flux rates, increased head gradients associated with decreased downstream spacing between logjam-induced backwaters, and thicker deposits of sand and gravel, which act together to create steep hydraulic head gradients within thick, permeable bed sequences. We also expect a nonlinear relation between logjams and HEF at the transition to anabranching as a result of the enhanced HEF between divided channels.  Implications of this work will be with respect to engineered logjams, which are currently being added to rivers, but with no systematic understanding of how the effects of LW addition scale with river size, the volume and spatial distribution of wood addition, or the characteristics of the wood and the channel, constraining our ability to design LW-based river restoration to achieve a desired level of HEF.

This is important because temperature and precipitation have strong effects on ecosystems. The main effects are on the flow of carbon, the supply of nutrients, the types of soil microbes, and the growth of plants. However, the exact rate and magnitude of change are unknown. This project will investigate a key knowledge gap by using experimental treatments that reduce precipitation and warm soil. This experiment has been sustained for almost two decades. This project will support the completion of the experiment in the next five years. The main question is whether the initial responses to shifts in temperature and precipitation are consistent over time, or whether the ecosystems adjust to the new conditions. In addition, this project will support scientific workforce training. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in methods of data collection and analysis. Outreach activities will be conducted with broad audiences through local non-profit groups. Finally, data will be provided online about primary production, plant community composition, and ecosystem carbon and nutrient balance, in open access format.<br/><br/>This project will extend a unique long-term experiment conducted across multiple ecosystem types, extending the timeline to over two decades. This experiment occurs along the C. Hart Merriam elevation gradient, extending from the forested slopes of the San Francisco Peaks to the woodlands and deserts of the Colorado Plateau, a region identified for its high sensitivity to climate. The project follows up on an earlier hypothesis that change in temperature and precipitation will elicit progressive reductions in primary production in semi-arid ecosystems that are sustained on decadal timescales. In other words, primary production may increasingly decline in response to the interactive effects of drought and heat. Here, two mechanisms will be tested that could drive this change: shifts in the plant community and changes in the nitrogen cycle. The prediction is that the combination of these two effects modulates long-term carbon and nutrient balance responses to experimental warming. Because these progressive effects operate on the timescales of community change and biogeochemistry (years to decades), measuring them requires continuing this long-term dataset. In this case, two decades will be sufficient time to see experimental responses of total ecosystem carbon and nitrogen balance. It is likely that that these responses will vary among the biomes represented along the elevational gradient, with the variation largely explained by the magnitude of the progressive effects. Testing these progressive effects across ecosystems ranging from desert grasslands to coniferous forests will fill critical knowledge gaps in ecosystem science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there are many resources available for programmers to learn the details for writing code, an increasing amount of the time all programmers spend is not on writing code but instead on choosing among and adapting the growing amount of existing code and libraries available to them. One study reported that the most frequent programmer activity is searching for and trying to understand unfamiliar code, and more than 30% of all searches are for determining which APIs to use and how to use them. However, after each sense-making episode in which a programmer gains knowledge for themselves, their work is essentially lost, with no one else benefiting. Although there are many tools to help programmers find the answers, there are very few tools to help programmers make use of the knowledge gained performing the task, or share that knowledge with others. Capturing the work that programmers do in foraging, navigating, and organizing code-relevant information could significantly benefit later programmers interested in similar information. By referencing the captured knowledge from the resulting code, this can provide design rationale for why the API is used that way, which is one of the most often missing pieces of documentation. Furthermore, by making it easier for programmers to build off one another's knowledge, this proposed work has the potential to reduce common security vulnerabilities that arise from programmers not learning from others' mistakes, leading to more secure and correct code.<br/><br/>In this research the PI aims to help the initial programmer collect, navigate, and organize knowledge to meet their goals, while capturing this knowledge and making it useful for later programmers with similar needs.

When performing tasks like these, programmers continually are making hypotheses, proposing questions, and discovering answers, both about the details as well as the meta-level questions such as the design rationale of why the decisions were made. These studies will inform the design, development, and evaluation of tools to support both the initial and later programmers.

The latest global TB report<br/>from the World Health Organization with data compiled from 205 countries put the figures at 1.5<br/>million fatalities and 9.6 million infections annually. The proposed technology uses the nano-<br/>Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) properties to enhance the detection signal of the TB biomarker by<br/>more than 100X. This results in detecting concentrations in femto-gram/milliliter range resulting<br/>in early detection and treatment. The specificity, faster results, low cost/test and ease of use,<br/>makes this system a substantive innovation in the TB diagnostic market. The TB testing market<br/>accounts for $1.5 billion annually of which North America is the second largest in terms of<br/>generated revenue due to the higher pricing for TB detection. The proposed technology will<br/>benefit the patients with early diagnosis and provide the health care professionals with early<br/>treatment options. With all the advantages this technology has to offer, it is expected to gain a<br/>significant share in the market place and generate a revenue stream.<br/><br/>The main limitation of the immunoassays is their inability to detect extremely small fluorescence<br/>signals that are associated with ultra-low concentrations of biomarkers. The proposed nano-<br/>Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) technology can overcome this limitation due to its exceptionally<br/>efficient light coupling, reduced scattering, high signal-to-noise ratio and directional<br/>excitation/emission. As a result, a fluorescence enhancement of P-GRAT is 100X or higher<br/>compared to a glass substrates or polyurethane well plates. Such enhancements translate to ultrasensitive<br/>detection and early diagnosis. Commercial immunoassays require hours to days to<br/>achieve pg/ml sensitivity. In comparison, P-GRAT can detect pg/mL range concentrations in less<br/>than three hours. P-GRAT utilizes a simplified design to exclude expensive optics like laser<br/>sources, high-magnification objective lenses and filter cubes. The use of 3-D printed parts to<br/>fabricate the system and use a smartphone as the detector further reduces the cost. We intend to<br/>develop and commercialize a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive (fg/ml) molecular detection system for<br/>Tuberculosis (TB). TB specific biomarkers Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and Interferon gamma<br/>(IFN-g) will be detected in urine and saliva. P-GRAT is a platform technology and can easily be<br/>adapted for the ultra-sensitive detection and diagnosis of other diseases, such as Zika, Ebola,<br/>HIV and Cancer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As explained by Bardeen-Cooper-Schriefer in their celebrated ""BCS"" theory, at low temperatures electrons in such metals may also form an exotic state known as a condensate of bosonic Cooper pairs. However, despite the vast experimental data supporting the above ""standard paradigm"", anomalies in experimental data, particularly in the limit of two-dimensions (2D), have been accumulating. It became clear that there exists a new class of metallic states at low temperatures, where the electronic properties cannot be understood on the basis of existing theories. The project focuses on the investigations of novel metallic states that emerge at low temperature, primarily in proximity to superconducting states. The project includes training of graduate students, and a post-doctoral scholar. The project will also seek to continue this tradition by actively recruiting women graduate students and post-docs to the group, while also maintaining strong international collaborations.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>A metallic state is defined as a state in which the conductivity remains finite as the temperature tends to zero. There is an extraordinarily successful ""Fermi liquid theory"" of clean 3D metals with long mean free path and relatively weak interactions. In this theory fermionic excitations (quasiparticles) have a finite density of states at the Fermi level, while bosonic excitations (e.g. zero sound) have lesser role at low temperatures, since their contribution to the current is negligible due to their vanishing density of states. The low-T conductivity of relatively pure 3D metals is determined by impurity scattering, and is given by the Drude formula. Another well-established paradigm is the BCS theory of superconductivity, which is based on the idea that under some circumstances electron attraction can dominate the electron repulsion so that at low temperatures electrons form a condensate of bosonic Cooper pairs. It is this condensate that carries the supercurrent. As parameters controlling the electronic environment change, the system may exhibit a superconductor to metal transition, which at zero temperature is a quantum transition. The conventional theory of metals also predict that as the system approaches the BCS superconducting state from the metallic side, its properties in no way reflect the proximity of the superconducting phase, and the conductivity of the system is controlled by the fermionic excitations everywhere in the metallic phase. Despite the vast experimental data supporting the above ""standard paradigm"", especially on bulk superconductors, anomalies in experimental data, particularly in the limit of two dimensions, have been accumulating.  It became clear that there exists a new class of metallic states in the zero-temperature limit, where the electronic properties cannot remotely be understood on the basis of Fermi liquid and Drude theories. This observation by itself is astonishing because it points to a new paradigm for the electronic properties of metals. Exploring the properties of such anomalous metallic states is the focus of this project. This will be done by fabricating a variety of thin-films superconductors, and study their transport properties. While in the past such studies focused solely on longitudinal conductivity measurements, this project will emphasize transverse transport, and will include thermal transport, which can further shed light on the nature of the metallic state. The application of electromagnetic perturbations such as magnetic and RF electric fields will be used to tune through these metallic states, or in some circumstances promote them. The project trains one or two graduate students, one post-doctoral scholar. The project will also seek to continue this tradition by actively recruiting women graduate students and post-docs to the group, while also maintaining strong international collaborations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the continental shelf , where the water is shallow and relatively well-mixed, the passage of strong storms can induce large Langmuir cells, the largest of which can span the entire water column and have a strong influence on sediment re-suspension. These so-called Langmuir supercells (LS) play an important role as vectors for the transport of sediment and bioactive material on shallow shelves: their quasi-organized nature makes them more effective than bottom boundary layer shear turbulence at moving material out of the low-speed layer near bottom and into the bulk flow for lateral transport. This study will analyze existing observations from three different sites at 15, 26 and 40m depths as well as high resolution numerical simulations to determine the influence on LS of a number of factors such as large scale flows, tidal currents, less dense surface layers and misalignment between wind and wave direction.  Continental shelves are biologically highly productive and LS have direct impact on processes affecting this productivity or distributing its products. Thus, it is essential that shelf models incorporate skillful parameterization of such dominant processes. This study will improve parameterizations used to account for Langmuir circulation in many coastal and regional models where the size of the domain precludes running the model at a high enough resolution to capture Langmuir circulations directly. One post-doctoral researcher, two graduate students and one undergraduate student in each summer will be trained in physical oceanography, turbulence dynamics and closures and numerical techniques. One of the students is from an underrepresented minority group.<br/><br/>In the coastal ocean, LS has been observed under tidal and geostrophic flow components, surface heat fluxes and misaligned winds and waves serving to influence LS strength and coherency, as measured through bottom-mounted vertical-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers (VADCPs). Observation sites consist of the Rutgers LEO observatory in 15m of water at the inner shelf off the coast of southern New Jersey, the Navy's R2 tower in 26m of water at mid-shelf off the coast of Georgia, and an additional site north of Cape Hatteras in 40m of water. Analyses of the measurements at LEO and R2 have demonstrated differences in LS characteristics, with more coherent and intense LS occurring at LEO. New analysis of the Cape Hatteras data as well as large eddy simulations (LES) of LS flows closely following the VADCP measurements at the three sites will elucidate the dynamics by which tidal and geostrophic flows, surface buoyancy and misaligned wind and waves combine to affect LS and associated vertical transport. The LES will help provide key information missing from the field data sets, such as detailed velocity structure in the surface and bottom boundary<br/>layers, required to make definite conclusions regarding the roles of the various forcing mechanisms influencing the LS at the different sites. LES will be used to obtain a scaling of vertical velocity fluctuations representative of the strength of non-local vertical mixing induced by LS under the various processes affecting its strength and coherency. The scaling of vertical velocity fluctuations will be used to inform a KPP (K-profile parameterization) developed by the PI accounting for the local transport of the overall Langmuir turbulence and the non-local transport induced by the LS. The updated LS KPP will be implemented in the one-dimensional vertical water column General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) for validation via comparisons with the LES and the field measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The labor share of US GDP has declined for several decades; this is also true in many other countries around the world. This research project seeks to understand the causes of this decline and the consequences for the well-being of working Americans. Past research on this topic has focused on documenting aggregate patterns in labor share, at the level of an entire economy, an economic sector, or a specific industry. This investigation will use a different approach, and will study the dynamics of labor share by looking at evidence from a large number of individual factories and retail outlets. The research seeks to distinguish between trends that are common across all these establishments and shifts of economic activity from individual factories and stores with relatively high labor share to low labor share establishments. Initial results suggest that this second kind of shift in economic activity is the major driver of the aggregate pattern. These preliminary results also show that individual establishments only maintain a low labor share for a few years; the team will also test hypotheses about why these establishments have a low share and why that share increases after several years. Understanding the causes of labor share decline is important.  We need this information to better target policies encouraging firms to hire and train the U.S. workforce.<br/><br/>The project will develop new knowledge about the establishment-level factors that are responsible for the aggregate decline in labor share. It will do this by using simple but powerful statistical tools to analyze establishment level data from the U.S. Census of Manufactures and Retail Trade. It will highlight the elements of current economic models that are inconsistent with the data on dynamics at both the establishment and aggregate levels of analysis. The result will be more useful information on establishment-level heterogeneity that can be used to redesign the assumed dynamics of firm behavior in macroeconomic models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is an interesting and complex regime where new phenomena are emerging but it remains largely unexplored since accurate theoretical and computational methods for the description of excited states can only be applied to small systems.  Dr. Neuhauser and coworkers are developing new methods which incorporate the necessary quantum mechanical effects at moderate computational costs.  A novel computational framework is being developed that merges quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics and applied mathematics through a probabilistic approach to the problem. Specific efforts are being made to involve undergraduate and high school students, and the project emphasizes leadership opportunities for graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>To obtain the fundamental physical characteristics of complex systems, a fully ab-initio quantum description is necessary.  The most suitable approach is to employ real time Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) with long-range exact exchange which approximates quasiparticle energies and includes attractive electron-hole interactions.  The latter are necessary to account for excitonic effects and the redistribution of spectral weight in absorption cross sections.  However, conventional implementations severely limit the maximum size of the system that can be treated using TDDFT with exact exchange.  The project develops a stochastic TDDFT method which simulates the exchange interaction stochastically, i.e., summations over all occupied states are replaced by random sampling of the occupied Hilbert subspace, while the remaining parts of the description can be simulated traditionally.  This makes it possible to treat systems with thousands of atoms and calculate the nonlinear response for systems that could not be handled previously.  Description of the optical response of highly inhomogeneous systems, e.g., defect states, is being treated with a new Embedded Stochastic TDDFT, which combines stochastic and deterministic TDDFT for different regions of space. Mentoring of students ranging from high school to postdoctoral status is provided through this work, and the software developed is being made available to the wider community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the many functions of the brain is to regulate behavior, such as social interaction among individuals, which, in turn, determines success in courtship and mating. It is known that behavior is guided by both genes and the environment, and that the influences interact closely. Brain function also is regulated by hormones in ways that are not well understood. This project studies such hormone-like factors and their influence on the behavior of fruit flies, a model organism for which there exist superb genetic and molecular tools. The genetic and molecular accessibility allows for easier examination and manipulation of these factors. As part of this project, flies that lack genes hypothesized to code for specific hormone-like factors are generated, and the effect on the fly's behavior is documented, to elucidate the relation between the hormone-like factors and behavior. The project also examines another important question: How do these factors pass through the blood-brain-barrier, a cell layer that protects the brain in most higher organisms, including humans. These studies will give new insight into the ways by which hormones circulating in blood communicate with the brain, and how this specific route of blood-brain communication influences behavior.  Ultimately, they will help to better understand how the brain works. These studies are being performed at one of the most diverse universities in the United States with a large student body, a large fraction of which comes from underrepresented groups. Both undergraduate and graduate students participate in the research and receive intensive training in the scientific process. <br/><br/>The overall goal of these studies is to examine how complex behaviors are regulated on a molecular level using the well-defined courtship behavior of male Drosophila as a model organism. It is known that gender-specific brain circuits are required for male courtship; however, successful execution of the behavior also requires modulation of these circuits. Circulating factors and hormones are an important part of this modulation. The present studies are based on the recent discovery that the blood-brain-barrier plays an active role in this process. The studies described here explore how specific signaling at this humoral-brain interface modulates courtship. Specifically, the focus is on a nuclear receptor expressed preferentially in males as a link between the action of the two major insect hormones Ecdysone and Juvenile Hormone. Conditional genetic manipulations are used to manipulate signaling through this protein-hormone network exclusively in the blood-brain-barrier. Findings that blood-brain-barrier cells are a site where integration of hormonal effects occurs have the potential to extend in significant ways appreciation of this tissue beyond its barrier function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In doing so, we will advance understanding of (i) how logjams affect water quality and stream communities in forested watersheds, (ii) the effects of historical and continuing human alteration of river corridors in forested regions, and (iii) how to design artificial logjams in rivers to manage stream temperature, nutrients, and aquatic communities. Our work will be shared with resource managers and practitioners to help with issues associated with river management and restoration. Student participation will include (i) K-12 students via course materials that will be developed in collaboration with elementary school teachers; (ii) undergraduate students involved in field data collection and analysis, including students from diverse backgrounds; and (iii) graduate students responsible for the primary data analysis and interpretation, who will have the opportunity to work with and mentor the undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>The benefits of large wood (LW) in river corridors are numerous, including the potential to enhance hyporheic exchange flow (HEF). Existing work has focused on HEF near single logs or single logjams. However, natural channels in forested regions with minimal human alteration commonly contain abundant dispersed LW pieces and multiple logjams spaced irregularly along the channel. We have little indication of whether multiple channel-spanning logjams produce an additive or nonlinear effect on HEF, but these alternatives have important implications for understanding river ecosystem function and for river management and restoration. Our primary objective is to quantify how HEF changes with increasing channel heterogeneity associated with channel-spanning logjams. We will use field measurements, physical experiments, and numerical models to evaluate the characteristics of HEF associated with different spatial densities of channel-spanning logjams. We expect nonlinear relations between logjams and HEF to result from increased bedforms such as pools that maximize flux rates, increased head gradients associated with decreased downstream spacing between logjam-induced backwaters, and thicker deposits of sand and gravel, which act together to create steep hydraulic head gradients within thick, permeable bed sequences. We also expect a nonlinear relation between logjams and HEF at the transition to anabranching as a result of the enhanced HEF between divided channels.  Implications of this work will be with respect to engineered logjams, which are currently being added to rivers, but with no systematic understanding of how the effects of LW addition scale with river size, the volume and spatial distribution of wood addition, or the characteristics of the wood and the channel, constraining our ability to design LW-based river restoration to achieve a desired level of HEF.

The ability to produce CMCs with 3D printing will enable superior designs in current applications, as well as enabling their use in a greater number of components that are currently limited by the higher density and lower temperature capabilities of superalloys such as Inconel and Invar. Developing this manufacturing process will enable more basic materials research by serving as a lower cost testbed for new CMC compositions since a mold is not required and turnaround times are much faster. This will also allow engineers to develop more optimized systems with a faster design cycle. This capability will result in efficiency increases in turbine and combustion engines for substantial improvements in fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Finally, the ability to 3D print CMCs will vastly improve geometric complexity of high temperature components, which will enable the next generation of hypersonic vehicles, supporting national defense.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is in establishing a novel manufacturing process for CMCs based on 3D printing. Melt infiltration is a low cost method to produce CMCs, which starts with a polymer matrix composite that is pyrolyzed, and then infiltrated with a molten metal. The matrix is usually a phenolic thermoset, but high temperature thermoplastics have recently been proven viable for simple coupons. This project will use 5-axis continuous fiber reinforced high temperature thermoplastic composites as green bodies. Since thermoplastics melt, support materials will be implemented during the pyrolysis step, which are effective in retaining part geometry. Additionally, a novel process of growing a boron nitride interphase layer on the fibers after pyrolysis instead of prior to forming the polymer composite will be implemented since tight corners during printing might damage an interphase layer. Finally, 3D printing with larger bend radius silicon carbide fibers instead of carbon fibers will be attempted. This project will demonstrate the effectiveness of this interphase with improved flexural strength and toughness, and the ability to form geometrically complex CMCs that are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make with other methods.

The Reynolds number is the ratio of flow's inertial forces relative to viscous forces, and it determines important flow properties such as turbulence.  Understanding flows with extremely high Reynolds numbers will increase efficiency in practical vehicle applications and improve understanding of the climate.  However, high Reynolds-number flow in conventional fluids like air and water occurs on a relatively large scale thus is difficult to study on the laboratory scale. Fortunately, high Reynolds number flows can be achieved using lower-density fluids such as cryogenic helium-4 in, for example, a small-scale laboratory pipe flow experiment. But to unlock the full potential of cryogenic helium-4, suitable flow measurement tools to quantify the turbulence are also required. The proposed research will therefore develop advanced molecular tagging velocity measurement techniques and apply the technique to high Reynolds number cryogenic helium pipe flow. In terms of educational opportunities, the joint College of Engineering operated by Florida State University and Florida A&M University will be leveraged to recruit under-represented minorities to participate in the project.

Advanced pattern-tracking algorithms will be incorporated, and the spatial and temporal resolutions of the tracer imaging process will be optimized. These developments will unlock the full potential of cryogenic helium in turbulence research and model testing. The planned study on high Reynolds number pipe flows in helium will allow an independent examination of the near-wall velocity field and the associated von K?rm?n coefficient, which may help resolve existing controversies regarding the universality of this coefficient. Also, new knowledge about the near-wall spatial velocity correlations will be produced by tracking the tracer lines created perpendicular to the wall.

The agents cooperate among themselves to efficiently search, explore, synchronize and reconfigure into patterns using distributed algorithms with limited memory, sensing and communication capabilities. The research will contribute to a deeper understanding of coordination protocols to complete navigational tasks, even when some of the agents may be faulty. Results from the research will provide critical insights that can be used in robot-assisted applications such as search-and-rescue in hostile or unknown terrains, or surface exploration needed to develop and maintain future colonies and human outposts on other planets. The study of reconfiguration problems will also provide ideas that can shed light on previously unexplained aspects of flocking phenomena in birds, such as murmurations. The project will involve undergraduate students in theoretical research and will train them to develop and maintain an open-source repository of distributed algorithms for robot coordination problems and their animations. In addition, results from the project will be archived as a permanent online resource for the parallel and distributed computing community at large. Two specific annual initiatives for outreach will be a part of the project: firstly, participation by the investigator and undergraduate research students in the Rutgers Future Scholars program, and secondly, conducting workshops for K-12 teachers to teach basic computational and algorithm design skills.<br/><br/>The project addresses fundamental theoretical problems of efficient, coordinated exploration and reconfiguration by a team of mobile agents as they work together to accomplish a computational task in simple geometric spaces.  Three basic problem settings are considered: (a) the search problem, where an unknown target location, which can only be sensed when reached, has to be found by at least one robot in the team, (b) the evacuation problem, that requires some subset of the robots to reach an unknown exit location in the region after it has been found, and (c) the reconfiguration problem, where the robots must rearrange themselves in a certain desired configuration based on either a given arrangement or on local rules. Within each problem setting, the goal is to develop an algorithm for the robots so that they can attain the desired configuration or complete the task defined by the problem with the minimum amount of resource usage possible, e.g. total distance traveled or time taken.

This rapid-increasing consumption significantly contributes to global carbon emissions. Therefore, updating the power delivery for data centers with improved efficiency is an important societal need. The goal of this project is to address this power consumption bottleneck by using a new power distribution and conversion architecture that is compact, scalable, ultra-efficient, low-heat, low-cost, and reliable. If successful, a wide application of the proposed system could result in more than 8.1 billion kWh or ~$810 million annual savings in electricity consumption for data centers in the U.S. alone. These savings would, in turn, reduce harmful greenhouse gas emission of ~1.3 million passenger cars from U.S. roads. The impact can be further amplified by adoptions of the proposed system and its sub-systems in other information technology applications, such as communication systems, automotive, high-performance portable devices, etc. The research will be conducted by graduate students and undergraduate students who will be equipped with the knowledge and skills in integrated power electronics and energy efficiency for future opportunities in both professional and educational development. The research will also involve educational efforts including official curriculum offerings and outreach activities to K-12 students.<br/><br/>To achieve the research goal, the team will explore a radically different power distribution and management architecture for future green data centers and other information technology systems. Employing new converter topologies that can efficiently support large conversion ratios, the architecture reduces the number of power conversion stages from the grid to core voltages from four or more to only two. The first stage, converting grid AC voltage to a DC bus voltage, electrically stack server boards in close proximity in a server rack to allow each of them to handle only a fraction of the input grid AC voltage, leading to ultra-high power conversion efficiency, low cost and high reliability. This first conversion stage also exploits a novel, experimentally validated smart-cable method that can significantly reduce on-board heat, leading to substantial thermal management cost reductions. For the second stage converting the DC bus to core voltages, the research team will explore a new direct-conversion hybrid DC-DC converter topology family to enable superior efficiency and power density at extremely large conversion ratios. The research plan includes design, fabrication, and verification of multiple new hybrid converter topologies, integrating different types of AC-DC and DC-DC hybrid converters, smart-cable solution design and implementation, system failure protection circuit implementation and test, system scaling for different specifications and applications, and benchmarking against existing solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prior work identified the a soluble enzyme in gills from sharks and rays as a novel molecular sensor and regulator of high blood pH. The current project will explore the putative role of this soluble enzyme in sensing and regulating low blood pH in shark gills, and will expand those studies to gills of other aquatic vertebrates, bony fishes. In addition, it will explore novel functions in red blood cells and heart muscle cells from both shark and bony fishes. Because those two cell types are greatly affected by pH, this soluble enzyme may play important roles in essential physiological processes such as oxygen uptake and delivery by red blood cells, and in contraction and heart beat rate by heart muscle cells. This project will develop biochemical, cellular, and physiological tools, many of which could be subsequently adapted to test similar hypotheses in other organisms. This information will help understand and predict how organisms respond to environmental and metabolic stress, as well as informing the management of wild and farmed populations in changing ocean conditions. This project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and develop onsite and online educational outreach activities for K-12 students in collaboration with SeaCamp San Diego, a local marine science camp for kids and teenagers.<br/><br/>The enzyme soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) produces the ubiquitous messenger molecule cyclic AMP in response to changes in CO2, pH and HCO3- levels. Since its discovery in 1999, sAC has been found to regulate diverse physiological processes in multiple animal phyla ranging from coral to mammals, and is therefore deemed an evolutionarily conserved acid/base sensor. The proposed research will: (1) continue research on elasmobranch gill cells to elucidate if sAC regulates acid secretion; (2) perform the initial molecular and biochemical characterization of sAC in a teleost fish (the rainbow trout); (3) explore the presence of multiple sAC splice variants in trout, and their putative differential subcellular localization; (4) characterize the putative role of sAC in trout gill cells in sensing and regulating blood acid/base status; (5) study a potential role of sAC in regulating oxygen binding in erythrocytes from shark and trout; (6) explore the role of sAC in cardiomyocytes, where it is hypothesized to regulate contractibility. To achieve those aims, a variety of experimental methods will be used including primary cell cultures, expression of GFP-tagged proteins in cultured trout fibroblasts, intracellular pH and Ca2+ measurements, erythrocyte oxygen-binding curves, sarcomere shortening, and immunocytochemistry. Given the established importance of acid/base status and cAMP on the physiology of gill cells, erythrocytes and cardiomyocytes, this research has the potential to find novel sAC-dependent mechanisms that regulate physiological functions essential to fish, and which potentially extend to other animals. The simultaneous study of elasmobranch and teleost adds a comparative and evolutionary component.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new hydrological regime is result of an increase in annual precipitation, a higher proportion of which is in the form of rain rather than snow, especially in the transition seasons of fall and spring. Under this collaborative project, the team will study annually laminated sediments in lakes of western Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic) to identify the sedimentary signal of recent changes in hydrology and use this to reconstruct the long-term history of rainfall-related sedimentary events to determine when similar conditions may have prevailed in the past.

If animals with parasites are less likely to reach their destinations, then migration may allow populations to escape habitats where parasites build up over time. Understanding how animal migration affects the spread of disease is important to predicting disease risk, including to humans. This study focuses on monarch butterflies as a model system and explores the impacts of parasites on butterfly populations that migrate and populations that have recently lost their migratory habits. This study will also examine how non-migrating populations may influence the risk of having parasites by the migrating forms in areas where they come together. Field and experimental studies will also examine how these microscopic parasites influence how long butterflies live and their flight ability.  Through the high visibility and public appeal of monarchs, this project will support the participation of citizen scientists on a continental scale. The investigators will also mentor and train undergraduate and graduate students and will develop web and classroom based educational materials on host-parasite relationships and animal migration. This work will provide additional opportunities for middle school students and support k-12 activities. Finally, this work will inform efforts to conserve monarch butterflies and our understanding of how migration may influence the importance of parasites across many systems.  <br/><br/>Using a monarch butterflies and protozoan parasite system, the goal of this study is to examine how migratory and sedentary behaviors influence transmission risk and severity of infection. Research activities will integrate (i) an analysis of continent-wide citizen science databases to monitor monarch butterfly abundance and infection; (ii) field and experimental studies to test how monarch migratory behavior depends on non-native milkweeds and infection status, and to quantify parasite transmission rates; (iii) molecular genomics to ask whether genetic changes in sedentary populations might reinforce the loss of migratory behavior; and (iv) mathematical modeling to track how host and parasite populations respond to migratory vs. sedentary strategies. Information on the mixing of non-migrants and migrants, inferred from stable isotope analyses of field-collected monarchs, will inform mathematical models of interacting sedentary and migratory populations, to explore the consequences for disease spread and the persistence of migratory populations. The project will develop theory for how overlapping migration strategies alter, and are themselves affected by, parasite infection, and will shed light on the evolution of migration by characterizing genetic changes that accompany the recent formation of sedentary populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genetic technologies have led to better predictive models for plant breeding and introduction of novel traits into crops that could not be added by conventional means. However, the ability to introduce novel traits using biotechnology is often hampered by low efficiencies. This project seeks to improve the efficiency with which Agrobacterium tumefaciens can serve as a tool to introduce novel traits into crop plants by exploiting the bacterium's ability to secrete proteins into plant cells. The transient delivery of these proteins will impact both the ability of the plant cell to detect and fight off the bacterium, and the ability of the plant cell  to regenerate a new plant once it has been altered. To meet this goal, a multidisciplinary approach will be taken that brings together expertise in genetics, microbiology and molecular biology. Importantly, the underlying biology of the project will be communicated through outreach efforts to the non-science community on all aspects of food production and on how innovations in agriculture help maintain the U. S. strategic advantage through its capacity to produce a plentiful and safe food supply. <br/><br/>The research to be conducted in this project lays out an innovative set of studies to design and test novel Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains that can help mitigate two major inefficiencies of plant transformation: the competency of the cell to receive a genetic reagent and the ability of that same cell to lead to germline transmission of the induced genetic change.  Pseudomonas effector proteins that suppress the plant innate immune response will be transiently expressed to improve the efficiency of gene transfer from bacterium to plant cell.  In addition, plant morphogenic proteins will be transiently expressed to improve the efficiency of regenerating plants from transformed tissue culture cells.  The results of these studies will also provide insight into the size limit of a protein that can be shuttled through the Agrobacterium type IV secretion system. Overall, this project should lead to A. tumefaciens strains with enhanced transformation capacity across a broader array of genotypes within a plant species and that are easily transferable to the plant science community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many application scenarios, the data consists of a set of objects endowed with some information that quantifies similarity or dissimilarity of certain pairs. Examples of such inputs include statistical distributions, user preferences in social networks, DNA sequences, and so on. A natural way to interpret such data sets is as metric spaces. That is, each object is treated as a point, and the dissimilarity between two objects is encoded by their distance. The successful application of this data-analytic framework requires finding a distance function that faithfully encodes the ground truth. The project seeks to develop new algorithms for computing such faithful metrical representations of data sets. The underlying research problems lead to new connections between the areas of computational geometry, algorithm design, and machine learning. The project aims at transferring ideas between these scientific communities, and developing new methods for data analysis in practice. The project will be part of the investigator's curriculum development, teaching, and educational and outreach activities. The main research problems that the project seeks to study will form the basis for the training of both undergraduate and graduate students. The investigator is committed to working with minorities and underrepresented groups.<br/><br/><br/>This metrical interpretation of data sets has been successful in practice and has lead to a plethora of algorithmic methods and ideas, such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, nearest-neighbor search, and so on. The area of metric learning is concerned mainly with methods for discovering an underlying metric space that agrees with a given set of observations. Specifically, the problem of learning the distance function is cast as an optimization problem, where the objective function quantifies the extend to which the solution satisfies the input constraints. A common thread in many works on metric learning is the use of methods and ideas from computational geometry and the theory of metric embeddings. Over the past few decades, these ideas have also been the subject of study within the theoretical computer science community. However, there are several well-studied problems in metric learning that have not received much attention in the algorithms and computational geometry communities. Moreover, there are many metric embedding tools and techniques, that where developed within the algorithms community, that have not yet been used in the context of metric learning. The project aims at bridging this gap by a systematic study of algorithmic metric learning problems from the point of view of computational geometry and approximation algorithms. The major goals of this effort are transferring algorithmic tools to the metric learning framework, as well as providing theoretical justification for metric learning methods that are successful in practice but currently lack provable guarantees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some proteins are switches; a signal molecule binds to the protein and switches its function from an ""off"" to an ""on"" state (or vice versa). The switch could sense the presence of a pollutant, or of an infection, and trigger defense mechanisms. It could sense the presence of cancer cells and trigger a cell-killing response. The potential sensing and response capabilities are tremendous. Two modular platforms for creating switches will be developed during this project. One will detect specific proteins, and the other will control gene expression. Success in the research of this proposal will enable others to develop protein switches with applications in synthetic biology for biomanufacturing as well as in basic biological research. Rigorous training of undergraduates and graduate students will expand the biotechnology workforce.<br/><br/><br/>Protein switches recognize input signals such as ligand concentration and trigger an output signal such as enzyme activity or DNA binding. Directed evolution has generated switches with high affinity for their ligand and large changes in output. However, developing suitable selections or screens to identify switches remains challenging and often greatly hinders switch development. In this project, modular protein switch platforms for protein sensing and for control of gene expression will be developed. The protein-sensing platforms will utilize designed ankyrin-repeat proteins and will trigger enzyme activity or fluorescence. The platform for modular control of gene expression will utilize the nuclease-null dCas9 protein of the Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) system, and protein domains that bind inexpensive small molecules. The switches will function as inducible repressors of gene expression, with the small molecules serving as low-cost inducers. The development of these modular platforms will provide a set of functional switches for biotechnological use and for mechanistic study to facilitate the design of future switches. These switches will be used in basic scientific research to understand cellular function and applied research in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Substantial progress has been made in empirically predicting how many aftershocks are produced in the aftermath of an earthquake. Although predicting the timing and size of aftershocks have received more attention historically, the expected total number of aftershocks is just as robust an observation.  In general, a magnitude 7 earthquake produces 10 times as many aftershocks as a magnitude 6 and the pattern continues for all magnitudes, i.e., the number of aftershocks increases by a factor of 10 for each magnitude unit. The project asks why does aftershock production follow this pattern? What information does it contain about earthquake mechanics? Why do some earthquakes, like the 2017 Chiapas earthquake produce many aftershocks, while others, like the 2017 Mexico City earthquake produce only a few?  And most importantly, can this information be used to anticipate the aftershock production in the critical days following a disaster? This project has broader implications for our understanding of earthquake hazards, and adds to the US-Israel scientific partnership. The work will also support graduate students and an undergraduate researcher to conduct research as part of the project. <br/><br/>Significant effort has been spent on these questions utilizing tools from statistical seismology. Many studies have focused on regional earthquakes, where statistics are most robust. Separating out the causes of aftershock production can benefit from information of the slip patterns of individual mainshocks that can be derived using global seismic data. Previous studies have strived to attack this problem by combining aftershock data with information about the timing and distribution of slip. The studies have been insightful, but have generally lacked the number of mainshocks required for statistical analysis. This lack has been, in part, because until recently slip maps were sufficiently difficult that they were only available for a small number of cases. Therefore, it was difficult to ask questions about the relation between aftershocks and mainshock rupture since different models are biased in different ways. This situation has changed dramatically with recently published large compilations of rupture sequences done uniformly with a single method. This work exploits a new era of combining information from kinematic ruptures and their ensuing aftershocks. The researchers will capitalize on this capability and attack aftershock productivity by: (1) using the spatial distribution of aftershocks relative to well-resolved coseismic slip maps to clarify physical origins of the magnitude dependence, (2) investigating regional variations in productivity, and (3) examining the interrelationship between aftershock productivity, regional strength, and arrest criteria for mainshock ruptures<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The seemingly fragile Monarch exhibits the longest flight range among insects. Individual Monarch butterflies may travel up to four thousand kilometers during the annual migration between North America and Central America. This project will examine the distinguishing characteristics of Monarch butterfly flight, including the slow tempo of the flapping wings, the effects of wing flexibility, and the mechanical coupling of wing and body movements. Furthermore, the Monarch flies at relatively high altitudes. Glider pilots have observed Monarch butterflies soaring on thermal currents at altitudes up to 1,250 km, and their overwintering grounds are at altitudes of up to 3,300 km. This project will examine whether the unmatched range of the Monarch among similarly sized animals lies in the combination of large, flexible wings, slow flapping speeds, and high-altitude flight. A multidisciplinary team will integrate expertise in computational mechanics, biological experiments, fluid dynamics, and nonlinear controls to uncover the physical mechanism underlying the highly efficient Monarch flight. This knowledge will be applied to the creation of transformative, bio-inspired micro-air vehicles with enhanced flight efficiency and superior flight range. Micro-air vehicles with extended flight range will improve the national quality of life by enabling long-term monitoring of environmental hazards. These vehicles will enhance national security by allowing long-term surveillance of large areas, and by providing long-range reconnoitering capacity for search and rescue. Engineering models of Monarch flight will also contribute to the understanding of their migration patterns, and thereby support the conservation of this endangered species.<br/><br/>The primary scientific objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that high-altitude flight is a critical component to the long-range flight characteristics of the Monarch butterfly. This will be achieved with a series of experimental, computational, and theoretical research efforts. The flight maneuvers of live Monarch will be measured by a motion capture system in a low-pressure chamber simulating the ambient environment at various altitudes. The measurements will be validated with computational fluid dynamics simulations for the unsteady viscous flows around flexible flapping wings integrated with a multibody dynamics model representing the thorax and the abdomen deformation. The resulting aerodynamic model will be approximated by an artificial neural network for real-time dynamic simulation, from which a nonlinear feedback control system will be constructed via Floquet-Lypuanov theory.

Massive ice shelves buttress marine terminating glaciers, slowing the rate that land ice reaches the sea and, in turn, restraining the rate of sea level rise. To date, most work has focused on the destabilizing impacts of warmer air and water temperatures, resulting in melting that thins and weakens ice shelves. However, recent findings indicate that sea ice does not protect ice shelves from wave impacts as much as previously thought, which has raised the possibility that tsunamis and other ocean waves could affect shelf stability. This project will assess the potential for increased shelf fracturing from the impact of tsunamis and from heightened wave activity due to climate-driven changes in storm patterns and reduced sea-ice extent by developing models to investigate how wave impacts damage ice shelves. The modeling effort will allow for regional comparisons between large and small ice shelves, and provide an evaluation of the impacts of changing climate and storm patterns on ice shelves, ice sheets, glaciers, and, ultimately, sea level rise. This project will train graduate students in mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary approaches to Earth and ocean sciences.<br/><br/>This project takes a four-pronged approach to estimating the impact of vibrations on ice shelves at the grounding zone due to tsunamis, very long period, infragravity, and storm-driven waves. First, the team will use high-resolution tsunami modeling to investigate the response of ice shelves along the West Antarctic coast to waves originating in different regions of the Pacific Ocean. Second, it will compare the response to wave impacts on grounding zones of narrow and wide ice shelves. Third, it will assess the exposure risk due to storm forcing through a reanalysis of weather and wave model data; and, finally, the team will model the propagation of ocean-wave-induced vibrations in the ice from the shelf front to and across the grounding zone. In combination, this project aims to identify locations along the Antarctic coast that are subject to enhanced, bathymetrically-focused, long-period ocean-wave impacts. Linkages between wave impacts and climate arise from potential changes in sea-ice extent in front of shelves, and changes in the magnitude, frequency, and tracks of storms. Understanding the effects of ocean waves and climate on ice-shelf integrity is critical to anticipate their contribution to the amplitude and timing of sea-level rise. Wave-driven reductions in ice-shelf stability may enhance shelf fragmentation and iceberg calving, reducing ice shelf buttressing and eventually accelerating sea-level rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The uncertainty and societal impact of this acceleration underscores the need for an improved understanding of relationships between regional sea level and climate. High-resolution sea level proxies spanning the past ~2,000 years (the ""Common Era"") reveal century-scale, decimeter-amplitude (up to ~20-cm), variability along the east coast associated with changes in dynamic sea level (DSL). These changes offer a unique benchmark for climate models, and the closest observational analog for climate-driven sea level change expected in the 21st century. This project will employ statistical and dynamical models to improve the scientific understanding of Common Era sea level changes along the east coast and their relationship with climate. The research team will leverage this knowledge to inform projections of 21st century DSL change and the ability of current-generation climate models to capture those changes, in turn informing coastal resilience efforts along the high-risk eastern North American coast. The project will provide funding and opportunities for an early career scientist and a graduate student to develop a diverse set of skills and collaborators in paleoclimate, climate modeling, and weather and climate risk assessment.<br/><br/>The project team will confront the sparsity of the proxy record and the limitations of current-generation paleoclimate simulations by testing hypotheses about the drivers of sea level variability using a broad statistically- and dynamically-based modeling strategy. Project tasks include: (1) a rigorous assessment of the robustness of regional DSL reconstructions generated with a hierarchical spatio-temporal statistical framework; (2) leveraging the statistical framework to assess linkages between DSL and other climate indices (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, sea surface temperature and salinity, Intertropical Convergence Zone position); and (3) conducting and analyzing coupled climate model simulations. Climate model simulations will be forced by proxy-derived surface fluxes and validated by a synthesis of complementary climate reconstructions. The simulations will reveal the dynamical mechanisms underlying correlations found in reconstructions and demonstrate whether relationships observed in the instrumental record persist over multidecadal-to-centennial timescales. The research is expected to lead to a more complete interpretation of Common Era sea level and climate variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metals such as manganese (Mn) can influence how much organic C is stored in soils by impacting plant growth and by helping to either stabilize or degrade organic compounds in the soil. This research will explore how Mn cycling between soils and plants influences storage of organic C in terrestrial ecosystems. This project will also create a network of educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students as well as K-12 educators and students. The educational objectives are to improve science literacy, integrate research with education, and broaden participation in geosciences by distributing earth science activities to regional K-12 educators through the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (CMNH). This project will also provide training for multiple graduate and undergraduate students who will be integral participants in both the research and educational components of the project.<br/><br/>Manganese is a biologically important and redox-active trace metal that may exert a poorly recognized control on carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems; however, the mechanisms by which Mn increases or decreases long-term carbon storage remains unclear. Although substantial research has been devoted to understanding how iron and aluminum oxides stabilize organic carbon, there is a scarcity of similar information regarding Mn oxides. Added to this knowledge gap are uncertainties related to how soil geochemistry regulates plant uptake of Mn, and how elevated foliar Mn impacts carbon loss and transformation during litter decomposition. The overarching hypothesis of this research is that vegetation regulates the geochemistry of manganese in terrestrial systems with secondary effects on organic carbon storage in soils. The implication of this hypothesis is that Mn is an unrecognized but significant regulator of the global C cycle. This research will integrate studies across multiple scales to explore three major components of manganese biogeochemistry and associated impacts on carbon cycling in the critical zone: (1) geochemical controls on rates of Mn cycling by forest vegetation; (2) influence of elevated foliar Mn on the quantity and chemical composition of organic C released during litter decomposition; (3) influence of Mn oxides on the storage or transformation of organic matter. Results will be integrated into a quantitative framework describing Mn-C interactions in plant-soil systems and lay the groundwork for future exploration of manganese biogeochemistry and coupled metal-organic interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, information is retained in magnetic memories in the absence of power supply, providing possibilities of new computing schemes.  However, existing magnetic memory devices have relatively low operating speed, which greatly limits their application. In this proposal, magnetic memory devices with ultrafast writing speed (<1 nanosecond) will be developed, which can potentially bring in revolutionary changes in memory and data storage industry. The realization of the ultrafast control of magnetic dynamics could also advance understanding on the properties of magnetic materials. In addition to these broad scientific impacts, this project also provides students with unique transdisciplinary training opportunities. This research project is proposed to be integrated with the educational missions, including inspiring career interest of K-12 students in science and engineering; providing undergraduate students with cutting-edge research opportunities; and preparing students for future careers through curriculum development and interdisciplinary collaboration.<br/><br/>To realize ultrafast magnetic memories, this proposal tries to leverage the fast development of fabrication techniques on spintronic devices with the recent advancement in new magnetic materials. Particularly, antiferromagnet will be studied for realizing magnetic memories with superior speed and high storage density. Compared with regular ferromagnet, antiferromagnet has ultrafast dynamics due to the high magnetic resonance frequency. However so far the lack of efficient control and detection mechanisms in antiferromagnet has made it challenging for practical implementations of antiferromagnet in magnetic memory devices. In this proposal, the PI focuses on spintronic devices made from antiferromagnet with internally broken inversion symmetry, where the inequality of the two sub-lattices allows the generation of staggered spin orbit torque and provides the possibility for magnetic probing and manipulation. The goals of the proposed experimental efforts include quantitatively determining the writing efficiency as well as exploring and optimizing the reading mechanisms of antiferromagnet. Specifically, a unique scheme for measuring antiferromagnet spin orbit torque is proposed, through which the underlying mechanisms for antiferromagnet switching will be revealed and quantified. Moreover, the switching speed of antiferromagnet devices will also be evaluated and the limiting factors on efficient magnetic switching will be determined through the antiferromagnet domain movement experiment. Finally, a high ON/OFF ratio will be pursued through the study of tunneling anisotropy magnetoresistance, which can lead to an efficient reading mechanism for antiferromagnet devices. In overall, the proposed research activities will not only facilitate the realization of practical antiferromagnet magnetic memory devices with fast accessing time and high density, but also enhance understanding on the current induced dynamics in antiferromagnet and widen awareness of the spin charge interaction in antiferromagnetically coupled systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cost of manufacturing is a serious issue for many of these drugs. One major cost is for the nutrients required by these microbes to grow and produce the drug. The goal of this project is to lower nutrient costs and overall production costs by growing two microbes together. One microbe is photosynthetic. It will utilize sunlight and carbon dioxide to generate nutrients that are then consumed by the other microbe. This removes the need to purchase expensive nutrients, decreasing the cost of drug manufacture. In this project, the target product will be endolysin, a novel treatment against chicken infections that can potentially avoid the widespread use of antibiotics in the poultry industry. The project will also educate students from the high school to the graduate level about co-cultures, preparing them for employment in the growing biomanufacturing industry.<br/><br/>Commercially, filamentous fungi like Aspergillus produce enzymes, antibiotics, and metabolites. Economic analysis reveals that the cost of organic carbon feedstocks is a major cost for these processes. In nature, filamentous fungi are found as part of lichens, which are a symbiosis between a photosynthetic autotroph (photobiont) and its partner, typically a fungus similar to Aspergillus.  The photobiont provides organic carbon, generated using carbon dioxide and sunlight, to partner fungal species. The fungi generate useful biochemicals.  The goal of this project is to implement synthetic lichen co-cultures as a transformative biomanufacturing platform for the production of a novel antimicrobial peptide. Cultivation conditions that allow Aspergillus and cyanobacteria to grow successfully together will be identified. Interactions between the two partners will be characterized using genome scale co-culture models that incorporate transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolic data. This model will be used to determine the media composition and cultivation regime that optimizes the growth and production capabilities of our synthetic lichen.  The synthetic lichen will then generate a novel anti-microbial peptide, endolysin, which could replace antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections in chickens.

Many questions remain about how organic matter is removed from freshwaters.  A key challenge is that not all organic matter is the same.  Organic matter dissolved in freshwaters is made up of many different compounds. These compounds range in age, source, and chemical composition, all of which can influence how fast they are processed.  To overcome this challenge, researchers will collect real-time sensor data and design field-scale experiments to measure how fast organic matter is removed by streams. The project aims to test hypotheses about what processes control the removal of different types of organic matter from streams and rivers.  This is important because organic matter provides energy that supports food webs, and can pollute downstream ecosystems. Organic matter processing can also determine rates of greenhouse emissions from streams and rivers to the atmosphere. This research will also provide valuable opportunities for high school teachers to engage in investigations that will enhance their ability to meet Next-Generation Science standards.<br/><br/>What processes drive organic carbon removal in streams, and how does organic carbon removal regulate the degree to which running waters are biological reactors versus exporters of organic carbon?  These are key unresolved questions in carbon cycle research.  This project will develop a proof-of-concept approach to test the hypothesis that non-additive effects of mixed organic matter sources (i.e. priming) control organic carbon removal in streams.  Data products will include estimates of organic carbon turnover distance derived from ecosystem metabolism and stream chemistry, as well as empirical measures of organic carbon removal from ecosystem-level experiments that use single-source and mixed organic carbon additions.  Project data and computer source codes will be shared openly via HydroShare and GitHub, respectively.  The research will be conducted at Flathead Lake Biological Station and the researchers will partner with the Station?s recently funded SensorSpace, a community facility for construction and testing of novel environmental sensors, as well as a test bed for integrating sensor-based data into Next-Generation Science curricula.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This change comes with uncertainty and that uncertainty makes it difficult to make good decisions about how to build systems that are maximally useful in the future. While developing new computer systems has always involved risk, the new magnitude of these uncertainties may now lead to either overly conservative design practices at one end, or designs that have 'fragile' performance at the other end. While risk assessment and management are expected in both business and investment, these aspects are typically treated as independent to questions of performance and efficiency in computer design when in fact they are not.  As hardware and software characteristics become uncertain (i.e. samples from a distribution), the resulting performance distributions quickly grow beyond our ability to reason about them with intuition alone. Through the collaboration of computer system designers and experts in the impacts of technology uncertainty, this project is developing new and fundamental techniques for both quantifying risk and optimizing designs in risk-aware ways. This project is working to transform the way in which architectures and systems, from micro to data-center scale, are designed and analyzed. The investigators are creating new technologies, but also making those technologies available and accessible through open repositories, involving undergraduates at all levels in his research, and integrating basic concepts from these statistical design methods into outreach through ""I love STEM"" and other efforts. This interdisciplinary project is targeted at advancing the frontiers of computer architecture, electronic design automation, and uncertainty quantification. The developed methodologies can also find application far outside the original area of inquiry e.g., impact risk analysis and management across many other engineering systems including renewable energy, robotic systems, and autonomous driving.<br/><br/>The work is demonstrating, for the first time, that it is possible to define, model, quantify, and mitigate computer architectural risk. By bridging ideas of risk and risk-management from economics and fast stochastic algorithms from uncertainty quantification, a new framework for high-level risk-aware computer architecture analysis is being created.  Efficient techniques, using fewer than 50 data points, can effectively estimate architectural uncertainty to enable the rigorous quantification and management of risk during computer architecture design. This framework is embodied in a symbolic / statistical analysis system that eases the exploration of these surprisingly complex design spaces.  A declarative language abstracts away the complexity of new probability-constrained optimization and intelligent sampling methods, while risk-aware micro and macro architectural improvements demonstrate the value of these methods in practice. The methods transform the way one can extract useful models of uncertainty from a limited selections of data points available to each manufacturer, propagate those uncertainties correctly through complex compositions of systems and the interactions of resources, efficiently quantify the impact of those propagated uncertainties on the end figures of merit for the system, encapsulate those methods in a language and solver framework, and develop exemplars of how such uncertainty can be more actively mitigated and controlled.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In an amazing achievement, the genetic sequence of these enormous DNA molecules was decoded about twenty years ago.  Despite knowing the sequence, it remains unclear how these enormous molecules are packed into a cell nucleus (approximately a six micrometer diameter sphere) in a way that the genetic information can be useful. Understanding how the information in DNA is made available for use by the cell is fundamental for advances in modern medicine and to advancing health.  During one phase in the growth of cells, the molecules of the nucleus fill it in an uncondensed polymeric form that rapidly moves because of natural thermal agitation. The molecular motion is not fully understood, especially the coherent motions caused by the close packing in the nucleus where many parts of the  molecules move together. The goal of this research is to determine the mechanisms of this dynamic self-organization using a powerful combination of experiments, simulations and modeling.  By providing a microscopic description for the origin of coherent motions, the proposed research will transform our understanding of the mechanobiology of the nucleus.  This project also will provide novel educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, who will receive training in advanced imaging techniques and analysis, cellular biology, polymer dynamics, fluid mechanics, as well as mathematical and computational modeling.<br/> <br/>This collaborative project will combine high-resolution live cell imaging experiments with theoretical and computational models to probe and illuminate the microscopic origins of interphase chromatin dynamics and its effect on the spatiotemporal self-organization of DNA.

These experiments will provide exquisite measurements of correlated motions over a wide range of length and time scales, and will be used to decipher the contributions of internal active forces on chromatin organization. Moreover, these experiments will guide theoretical and computational models based on coarse-grained descriptions of the chromatin as a confined and hydrodynamically interacting flexible polymer chain driven internally by stochastic force dipoles representing active enzymes. We will test the hypothesis that chromatin dynamics is primarily the consequence of internal activity via hydrodynamic interactions, and use quantitative comparisons between experiments and models to elucidate the symmetries, frequencies, and intensities of active events responsible for coherent motion.

Its goal is to introduce undergraduate students to key elements of research on land and water resources essential to improving management practices, with a focus on Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) and diverse interdisciplinary research teams.  Each year, students divided into three teams to conduct research that integrates Earth-surface dynamics, geology, hydrology and other disciplines. Research teams are hosted by two Native American communities (Confederated Salish Kootenai Tribes and Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa) and the University of Minnesota to work on projects developed in collaboration with the tribes' resource management divisions. This REU Site incorporates an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach that emphasizes quantitative and predictive methods, CBPR, indigenous research methods, and traditional ecological knowledge. The REU Site encourages participation by underrepresented students and students who are unsure about how they fit into the world of science to pursue STEM careers. <br/><br/>The REU Site introduces a new paradigm for undergraduate research incorporating place-based and community-based participatory research. The PIs are building knowledge on increasing participation in REUs by non-traditional students and students from groups underrepresented in STEM. The researchers have developed a proven, structured, scaffolded method of teaching science research and writing, which takes students who may have never written a technical research paper and provides them with the skills and support needed to routinely deliver high quality intellectual outputs and increase their intellectual self-confidence in the process. The mentoring plan for the REU Site is focused on helping mentors to: a) prepare to mentor highly diverse teams of students; b) support mentors to deal with the expectations, issues and challenges that arise when you are mentoring teams that have a large number of nontraditional students; and c) help mentors get acculturated to conducting research on tribal lands and with Native people. The students, faculty, graduate and post-doctoral mentors, tribal professionals and other community members are intimately engaged in CBPR, developing projects that inherently support tribal resource management goals. Results are disseminated to tribal authorities and community members as well as the broader scientific community.

This presents a fundamental problem for applications with limited, expensive or private data, such as in healthcare. One example of these applications with the small data challenges is human in-bed pose and pressure estimation. In-bed pose estimation can be a critical part of prevention, prediction, and management of movement-related problems like pressure ulcers. These pressure ulcers often lead to costly and painful conditions such as bedsores. In this research, we propose a semi-supervised generative model based on novel data augmentation and cross-modality data reconstruction techniques to expand the use of powerful deep learning approaches to the in-bed pose and pressure estimation problems. This grant will directly fund the education and mentorship of graduate students involved in researching these problems. In addition, middle school and high school students will be engaged through summer school mentorship programs at Northeastern University.The educational outreach funded by this grant will be used to mentor at schools primarily serving minority student populations. This comprehensive mentorship from middle school to PhD creates a pipeline of experienced students in this important area. The PI actively maintains a diverse research group which includes 50% women and other members of under-represented groups. <br/><br/>This proposed research explores the use of semi-supervised physics-based generative models to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and the small data problem common in personalized healthcare and other data-limited domains. The use of a physics-based approach to generate image data from a low-dimensional parameter space is unique and transformative. This proposal organizes the research to two Thrusts: (I) data augmentation, which synthesizes the large training set required to train a deep learning model to recognize the in-bed pose from an image; and (II) cross-modality data reconstruction, which extracts pose parameters from one image modality to generate data in another image modality. The success of the data augmentation will be measured by using the synthesized image data to train a network, which will be tested against deep and non-deep models trained on publicly-available pose datasets. The accuracy of the pressure image reconstruction will be tested by comparing the results to pressure images taken from a high-resolution pressure sensing mat. The successful completion of this project enables (1) the use of high-accuracy deep learning techniques for robustly recognizing objects and object poses for which articulated 3D models are available or can be generated; and (2) generating highly realistic images of posable figures in one sensory domain using data from another, when one sensory domain is cheaper or easier to gather data in than others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research aims to determine how decision-making processes influence actions taken to manage stormwater and the subsequent environmental outcomes at the watershed scale. The project will compare the Cleveland and Denver metropolitan regions, which are characterized by distinct institutional and environmental conditions, in order to distill general lessons about stormwater management dynamics in urbanizing regions. <br/><br/>The investigators will determine how individual and institutional decision-making processes influence stormwater management actions through analysis of policy documents and a survey of stormwater managers (Objective 1). The research team will quantify how stormwater management actions influence flow regime at watershed scales through a combination of field monitoring and modeling (Objective 2). Further, the team will evaluate how flow regime modifies the ecosystem health status of urban watersheds (Objective 3). Findings from these objectives will be integrated to predict environmental outcomes from stormwater management strategies through a Bayesian network model linking decision-making to environmental outcomes (Objective 4). This study presents an integrative framework to empirically establish the cascading effects of decisions on stormwater management actions and environmental outcomes, both within and across regions. New scientific insight into stormwater management for urban aquatic ecosystem health is targeted to inform future directions of stormwater programs in US urban areas. This research will provide education and training opportunities around engineered stormwater systems and urban watersheds for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students through hands-on research and data-based course activities.

Due to the intermittent nature of wind and solar, stationary energy storage is a requirement for grid buffering to provide electricity during low production times, such as during the night for solar or when the winds are calm. While lithium-ion batteries remain the predominant rechargeable battery technology in terms of energy density and market share, the scarcity of lithium makes it too expensive to be used for stationary scale grid storage. Potassium-ion batteries have recently seen increased interest as a sustainable, domestically available alternative, in terms of its higher operating voltage and its promise with a graphite anode. While many promising electrode materials have been researched for this system, practical engineering considerations such as battery safety and temperature dependent performance remain unexplored. This project will provide fundamental knowledge of the chemical reaction mechanisms and transport occurring in the graphite anode and the electrolyte interface that relates to the understanding of the safety considerations of the performance of the battery to avoid thermal runaways. Electrochemistry education is the other primary goal for this project. The PI has developed creative experimental kits for outreach that are appropriate for pre-college students for experiments and tests that convey key concepts in batteries and electrochemical reactions. <br/><br/>The technical goal of this project is to improve the fundamental understanding of potassium-ion (K-ion, K+) battery chemistry to evaluate temperature effects on battery safety and performance. While the mechanism of K+ intercalation into graphite has been investigated through experimental and computational studies, this chemistry has only been studied so far at room temperature. The PIs will study these K-ion batteries at higher temperatures to understand the energetics and kinetics of reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface that may lead to thermal runaway. Four research tasks are planned: (1) accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) analysis of K-ion batteries to probe thermal runaway behavior; (2) investigation and characterization of K-ion battery carbon anode solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer; (3) study the effect of operating temperature on electrochemical performance (e.g. cell ageing) and safety (e.g. K dendrite formation); and (4) test electrode binders and electrolytes, to enhance K-ion battery system safety and performance by manipulation of the SEI layer. Mechanistic studies of thermal runaway will be investigated by ARC analysis of the cycled electrodes, exploring the influence of SEI, state of charge, and electrolyte composition. This project will also involve detailed systematic characterization of the SEI layer for carbon anodes via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with depth profiling. Determination of model parameters for SEI growth and K+ diffusion coefficients, will be carried out by the temperature study, via electrochemical characterization methods such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). These results will generate deeper understanding of the relationship between SEI composition and battery safety, and the influence of temperature on cell performance, providing further insight into alkali metal-ion battery systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The discovery of proteorhodopsins in many diverse marine prokaryotic microbes has initiated extensive investigation into their distributions and functional roles.  Recently, a proton-pumping, rhodopsin-like gene was identified in diatoms, a group of marine phytoplankton that dominates the base of the food web in much of the Southern Ocean. Since this time, proteorhodopsins have been identified in many, but not all, diatom species.  The proteorhodopsin gene is more frequently found in diatoms residing in cold, iron-limited regions of the ocean, including the Southern Ocean, than in diatoms from other regions. It is thought that proteorhodopsin is especially suited for use energy production in the Southern Ocean since it uses no iron and its reaction rate is insensitive to temperature (unlike conventional photosynthesis). The overall objective of the project is to characterize Antarctic diatom-proteorhodopsin and determine its role in the adaptation of these diatoms to low iron concentrations and extremely low temperatures found in Antarctic waters. This research will provide new information on the genetic underpinnings that contribute to the success of diatoms in the Southern Ocean and how this unique molecule may play a pivotal role in providing energy to the base of the Antarctic food web.   Broader impact activities are aimed to promote the teaching and learning of polar marine-sciences related topics by translating research objectives into readily accessible educational materials for middle-school students.<br/><br/>This project will combine molecular, biochemical and physiological measurements to determine the role and importance of proteorhodopsin in diatom isolates from the Western Antarctic Peninsula region. Proton-pumping characteristics and pumping rates of proteorhodopsin as a function of light intensity and temperature, the resultant proteorhodopsin-linked intracellular ATP production rates, and the cellular localization of the protein will be determined. The project will examine the environmental conditions where Antarctic diatom-proteorhodopsin is most highly expressed and construct a cellular energy budget that includes diatom-proteorhodopsin when grown under these different environmental conditions.  Estimates of the energy flux generated by proteorhodopsin will be compared to total energy generation by the photosynthetic light reactions and metabolically coupled respiration rates. Finally, the characteristics and gene expression of diatom-proteorhodopsin in Antarctic diatoms and a proteorhodopsin-containing diatom isolates from temperate regions will be compared in order to determine if there is a preferential dependence on energy production through proteorhodopsin in diatoms residing in cold, iron-limited regions of the ocean. Educational activities will be performed in collaboration with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center who co-ordinates the SciVentures program, a popular summer camp for middle-school students from Chapel Hill and surrounding areas.  In collaboration with the Planetarium, the researchers will develop activities that focus on phytoplankton and the important role they play within polar marine food webs for the SciVentures participants. Additionally, a teaching module on Antarctic phytoplankton will be developed for classrooms and made available to educational networking websites and presented at workshops for science educators nationwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study will also examine how non-migrating populations may influence the risk of having parasites by the migrating forms in areas where they come together. Field and experimental studies will also examine how these microscopic parasites influence how long butterflies live and their flight ability.

These classifiers are typically built by a process of 'supervised learning', in which a computer is given a collection of (input, output) pairs that illustrate a desired behavior (e.g. if the input is this English sentence, the output should be this Spanish sentence) and is told to produce a function that replicates such behavior. This is a rigid form of learning that is known to suffer from a variety of fundamental hurdles; for instance, there are classes of concepts that cannot efficiently be learned in this way. This project will study how such hurdles can be overcome by moving to a more natural learning setup, in which the learning machine is allowed to interact with a human while learning, and receives feedback that is richer than just output values. This research has the potential to influence the way in which machine learning is performed and to broaden its scope of applicability. It is inherently multidisciplinary, and thus part of the project includes community-building activities that will bring together different groups of relevant researchers. There is also an educational component to the project, centered on bringing knowledge of algorithms and machine learning to various student groups that have traditionally been under-represented in STEM disciplines. Interactive learning is a field with great promise in which most of the work to date has consisted of one-off systems geared towards specific applications. This project will aim to bring rigor, formalism, and algorithms with provable guarantees to parts of this field that are currently lacking them.<br/><br/>This project will aim to formalize forms of human feedback (to a learning machine) than are richer than those traditionally studied, such as: simple explanations (e.g. this bird is not a canary because it has the wrong type of beak); attention-focusing; and similarity judgments. The investigators will design algorithms that are able to use these kinds of feedback and have rigorous guarantees, both on correctness and on statistical rates of convergence. The project is particularly focused on overcoming fundamental hardness barriers in learning: learning concept classes that would be intractable to learn in the usual supervised framework; learning with dramatically fewer examples than would normally be needed; adapting to situations in which the distribution of the data is constantly shifting; and improving the results of unsupervised learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new cap design satisfactorily addresses the shortcomings of previous commercialization efforts that were unable to meet the prescribed protective requirements; failed to pass both the players' fashion expectations and comfort evaluation; and carried a hefty purchase price. The acceptance and use of the new cap by professional baseball players will create widespread demand from collegiate, high school and Little League players, a market that is estimated to generate annual revenues of more than $18M. These market projections exclude consideration of the technology's Broader Impact potential in other sports or vocational and military applications, where there is a growing recognition of the need for improved head protection for athletes, soldiers, law enforcement officials and construction workers. Sports injuries are now highly scrutinized, especially those causing long-term medical issues from brain injury, blunt force trauma and repetitive concussive injury. The societal value of this innovation will be found in safer sports and work environments. Such equipment represents a rapidly growing segment of the apparel market and a unique commercial opportunity for the company. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is based on the company's patented design that provides head protection from the impact of a baseball. The novelty of the protective cap headliner is its flexible outer hard shell made with highly rigid interconnecting truncated icosahedron panels. This allows the headliner to conform to the shape of the head while maintaining the stiffness needed to diffuse impact loads.  Since the impact of a baseball represents a short duration point load, the energy-absorbing capacity of the layer beneath the outer shell can be minimized. The objective is to identify the material characteristics required to dissipate the impact load associated with a Severity Index of 1200 or greater when a head-form is struck by a baseball traveling at speeds up to 125 mph; and to identify the material combination(s) best suited to achieve this goal. Traditional foam materials as well as state-of-the-art material compositions will be used in unique configurations to produce solutions that are not too heavy, not too bulky nor too hot to wear. The outcomes of this study will determine the availability of materials that can be used within the ergonomic and mechanical constraints of the patented design to protect the head.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reason is that the HPC storage system often is the Achilles Heel of HPC systems, as it is fraught with numerous scenarios for contention, congestion and performance variability. This problem is getting worse due to: (a) the increased importance of data-driven HPC and the growth in the amount of data generated by large-scale simulation; and (b) the slower growth of disk speed, as compared to CPU speed. The addition of high-bandwidth persistent memory devices as burst-buffers brings in new opportunities for fast caching of application data while still allowing data persistence. However, the conventional approach of exploiting burst-buffers as yet another caching layer cannot reduce the lengthy and costly data processing steps in the deep I/O stack or reconcile occasional contentions inside the complex storage system. This project, therefore, seeks to exploit burst-buffers as repositories of persistent application-specific parallel file systems, with a lifetime commensurate to the lifetime of an application or an application campaign on a HPC system. This is a collaborative project between University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Florida State University. <br/><br/>This project formulates a research framework called Ephemeral Coherence Cohort (ECC) that offers an abstraction to represent the active collection of application data through containerization, insulate I/O activities across different applications, and enable storage disaggregation for ephemeral allocation and dynamic utilization of burst buffers. The proposed ECC framework aims to enhance a variety of mission-critical applications running on the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation leadership computing facilities. The project strengthens the collaboration between University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the Florida State University. The project has plans to organize panels and birds-of-feather sessions on burst buffer research in the upcoming HPC conferences and collaborate with leaders of super-computing centers for wider community penetration with techniques from this research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such building systems could enable immediate occupancy and minimum economic losses after an extreme event, contributing to continued national prosperity and welfare. Progress has been made towards addressing this challenge with the development of unbonded, post-tensioned, shear walls (UPSWs) in buildings; yet limiting issues for designing such shear walls remain. This research will explore an innovative concept for structural shear walls to resist lateral loads in buildings and perform damage free during an extreme event. The concept consists of coupled, unbonded, post-tensioned, reinforced concrete walls that interact with the foundation via a curved surface. Lateral deformations will be accommodated through a pendulum-type motion as the wall slides along the bottom curved surface. Lateral resistance will be provided by friction along the curved surface and the vertical unbonded post-tensioned cables. The post-tensioned cables also will help restore the wall to its initial configuration. Energy dissipation of these coupled pendulum walls will be provided by incorporating connecting devices that use elastic buckling and release accumulated elastic energy during the walls' deformations. The system response thus will leverage the resulting deformations rather than trying to constrain them, as in traditional systems. The result will be new technology related to the design of damage-free structural building systems, and a new way of thinking about leveraging system geometry and deformations for enhanced resilient and sustainable buildings. Parallel to the research effort will be complementary educational and outreach components, including the training of two Ph.D. students, research experiences for undergraduate students, a project website with tutorials and research findings for undergraduate and graduate students and practitioners, and outreach activities for middle and high school students.  The tutorials, as well as data from this project, also will be made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Data Depot (https://www.designsafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>The core idea of this research is that of a new design philosophy envisioned to be unrestricted by traditional material failure limit states. This philosophy will be verified through a new concept for coupled UPSWs. The material response limitations of rocking UPSWs will be addressed by harnessing the nonlinear kinematic behavior resulting from coupled system deformations. Thus, the project objective is to develop the enabling theory and technology for a new concept of UPSWs that can perform damage free and unrestricted by material failure limit states. This objective will be achieved through two unique and complementary features: (1) individual walls gliding along a circular path with no separation at the footing interface, and (2) continuous energy dissipation via devices with controllable elastic instabilities along vertical wall joints. This concept will be designated as a pendulum UPSW system, as it rotates about a fixed point on the wall. The approach to be followed will be to characterize the in-plane response of pendulum UPSWs as viable lateral load resisting elements, develop and characterize the use of elastic meta-materials and meta-structures for dissipating energy via elastic instabilities, and characterize the response of pendulum UPSWs coupled with elastic multi-stable structures as connectors. A combination of analytical, numerical (finite element), and experimental methods will be used. This research will lead to the fundamental integration of system geometry and deformations for the design of lateral load resisting structures that are resilient and sustainable. The study will promote new design concepts that harness deformations for optimal performance rather than performance objectives set to target material limit states. The research also will contribute to the use of nonlinear elastic instabilities in large-scale structural systems. Theory and methods related to damage-free structural systems, friction models, and elastic energy dissipation devices will also be advanced.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) experimental facility is likely the world's most sophisticated experiment addressing atmospheric new-particle formation.  It was constructed to measure new particle formation under highly controlled, ultra-clean conditions.<br/><br/>CLOUD is an international member-funded consortium supporting the maintenance and operation of the experiment.  Members raise research funding from their national agencies to participate. Experiments are conducted at CERN during 1-2 carefully planned campaigns per year, each lasting 8-10 weeks. These campaigns are planned, and data are assessed, during two major week-long consortium meetings each year, while more focused, intensive data analysis is carried out at all times by individuals, but also in several focused team meetings scheduled and hosted on an ad-hoc basis during the course of each year as analysis and interpretation require. Virtual team meetings via skype and other media are ongoing and continuous.<br/><br/>In addition to providing the required consortium fee, this project will support shipping and travel to CLOUD experimental campaigns and associated consortium meetings and data workshops. The doctoral and postdoctoral students associated with the project will be integrated into an international collaborative network of students and senior researchers who are among the most highly regarded in aerosol science and atmospheric chemistry. They will receive invaluable training in the conduct of international collaborative research.<br/><br/>The subject of the CLOUD experiments is of high national and international interest. Aerosol-cloud interactions are among the largest sources of uncertainty in the understanding of climate forcing and climate sensitivity. CLOUD experiments confirm that ions can stabilize nucleating clusters, and that, for otherwise weakly bound clusters (such as ammonia sulfuric acid, organics with sulfuric acid, and pure organics), ions can enhance nucleation rates by factors of 3-100 depending on conditions.  During the period of this project, three campaigns, CLOUD-13, CLOUD-14, and CLOUD-15, are planned.   The campaigns will focus on the following broad topics: the role of organic oxidation chemistry in new-particle formation and growth; new-particle formation in urban areas; new-particle formation in the marine atmosphere; and the role, if any, of charge in cloud-droplet formation and ice-crystal nucleation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, children transition out of naps during preschool years. Whether naps should be encouraged in preschools, or eliminated to provide more time for early learning, is not clear. The overarching objective of this proposed research is to examine the role of sleep and brain development on memory during early childhood, specifically as children transition out of naps. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that maturation of memory-related brain regions during this transitional developmental period results in more information being retained in memory without interference. This in turn reduces the need for frequent consolidation, which ultimately underlies the transition out of naps. This research will deepen understanding of how sleep benefits learning and memory in healthy children, providing benefit to healthy child care, and pre-school education.<br/> <br/>Sleep-dependent memory consolidation is thought to reflect transfer of memories from the hippocampus to the cerebral cortex. Although we have previously documented changes in memory performance as a result of sleep-dependent consolidation in young children, the neural mechanisms supporting this process have yet to be examined. This gap is problematic as memory and the hippocampal-cortical network both undergo significant developmental change during this period. Our goal is to identify the mechanistic pathway through which brain development and sleep physiology underlie changes in memory during childhood development. To accomplish this, we will obtain measures of brain structure, brain function, sleep physiology, and memory. We hypothesize that age-related changes in the development of the brain and sleep physiology will result in larger and stronger memories. Likewise, we expect increased hippocampal functional connectivity to allow for more efficient memory transfer with sleep, and will be associated with changes in slow wave sleep. We will use models to test the hypothesis that changes in hippocampal structure will precede changes in hippocampal function; these combined changes will lead to changes in sleep patterns; and that improved sleep will improve memory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date most viruses have been intensely studied in light of animal and plant health. Yet, these viruses are a small fraction of the earth's total viral biodiversity, and as a result the vast majority of viruses on earth remain unexplored. Studying virus diversity is a major challenge in biology with important consequences for understanding the earth's biosphere. To address this challenge, this project will study phycodnaviruses, an exceptionally diverse group of viruses that infect algae found in lakes, rivers, and oceans around the world. Phycodnavirus diversity and population dynamics will be explored in lakes which are critical natural resources impacted by local and regional environmental changes. The results of the study will be of broad importance as these viruses affect algal blooms and ultimately the cycling of nutrients within lakes. The study of phycodnaviruses will be of use to other scientists and provide valuable information for the management of freshwater resources. The research will fill fundamental gaps in our knowledge by discovering novel viruses and determining the environmental conditions driving virus diversity in lakes. This research will also provide a powerful platform for training undergraduate students in a broad range of scientific methods and enhance both student and public appreciation for the hidden biodiversity within lakes.<br/><br/>Phycodnaviruses provide a model system for exploring phylogenetic patterns of diversification based on their extreme diversity (~350,000 'species'), high abundances, ecological roles, rapid turnover rates, and biogeographic distributions.  Using well-developed metagenomic and phylogenetic methods, an innovative longitudinal survey in the Puget Sound region will be used to discover the ecological and phylogenetic diversification of phycodnaviruses across freshwater ecosystems that vary in nutrient levels and host composition. In addition to the discovery of phycodnavirus lineages, this research tests the hypothesis that patterns of phycodnavirus diversity and abundance (onset, peak, and decline) are influenced by changes in aquatic environmental conditions among lakes. The project will characterize phycodnavirus diversity through two approaches: targeted sequencing of the polymerase B gene and phycodnaviral whole-genome sequencing from environmental DNA samples across urban and wilderness lakes. Phylogenetic, bioinformatic, and statistical analyses of DNA sequences and limnological measures will be used to identify patterns and relationships between viral diversity, seasonality, and environmental variables. This research is expected to discover novel phycodnavirus lineages with unique genome architectures, high levels of viral diversity within and between lakes, and clear examples where novel viral lineages emerge to generate new species assemblages linked with season and/or geography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experiments can help understand how proteins interact with each other to alter the cell's behavior; however deciding which proteins to test in an unbiased manner is challenging. Networks, or graphs, are commonly used to represent interactions among proteins, where proteins (nodes) are linked by pairwise interactions (edges).  While network-based methods have been popular for many years, predictions from these methods are often challenging to interpret and the tools have not been made easily accessible to biologists, dramatically slowing the potential pace of scientific discovery.  The goal of this research is to develop novel methods that more closely reflect the biological questions posed by experimental biologists, and enable the adoption of such tools by the scientific community.  This work will be accomplished at a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI), and students who wish to pursue careers in biology need computational training.  The project will establish a program for undergraduate training in computational biology at PUIs through local and national initiatives that support both student and faculty development.  This project will offer frameworks for (a) introducing computational biology to undergraduates through conference attendance and (b) implementing computational biology activities and courses for undergraduate biology programs with limited resources.

This project identifies a unifying concept in graph theory -- that of computing directed, connected paths in graphs -- and applies this idea to signaling pathway analysis questions posed in multiple fields of biology.  Novel path-finding algorithms will be developed to generate mechanistic hypotheses of active signaling, using dysregulated signaling in disease as a case study.  These path-finding algorithms will be applied to signaling pathway analysis in cellular and developmental biology, including pathways that regulate changes in cell shape (morphogenesis) and eye development (retinal neurogenesis).  Close collaborations with biologists will help inform the development of easy-to-use tools and broaden their applicability to other fields.  The final aim will establish hypergraphs, a generalization of directed graphs, as an improved mathematical representation of signaling. The collection of novel methods produced by this project, along with a demonstration that these tools serve as hypothesis generation engines for other fields in biology, will be a significant step towards accelerating the hypothesis generation-validation-testing research cycle.  Biological contributions by adopters of these methods will exponentiate this work's impact on scientific knowledge and discovery beyond the computational contributions in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process, nanosecond laser shock peening, requires a protective coating to combat the heat affect zone, and a confining medium to promote the shock waves. The research will investigate the ability of a femtosecond laser shock peening process, which has higher energy density, to achieve the same result without the need for the protective coating and confinement layer. Eliminating the coating and confinement layer will significantly reduce setup complexity and manufacturing costs. Knowledge gained on the fundamental physical mechanisms occurring during femtosecond laser peening will be leveraged to realize a higher resolution process capable of processing a broader range of materials than currently possible by nanosecond laser peening. This advanced manufacturing capability will contribute to the competitiveness of the US by finding application in the development of progressive precision instrumentation, 3D-printing technologies, biomedical implants, and micro-mechanical systems. In addition to providing graduate students with advanced manufacturing expertise, the research results will be integrated into both course modules and educational outreach activities aimed at underrepresented minorities to further encourage more qualified people into the manufacturing work force. <br/><br/>The research objective is to understand the fundamental mechanisms and limitations of femtosecond laser shock peening without a protective coating in an air environment. To achieve this both process related non-equilibrium electron dynamics, and super-high strain-rate deformation mechanisms will be investigated. A unique in-situ measurement method will be used to capture the plasma dynamics occurring during femtosecond laser shock peening of stainless steel 304 and aluminum 6061 samples. The microstructure evolution will be characterized to study the deformation dynamics under ultrahigh pressure and stain rate, while the surface morphology, residual stress, surface hardness, and fatigue will be measured to test the effectiveness of the process. Hybrid numerical models, validated by experiments, will be utilized to further understand the underlying mechanisms. A Fokker-Planck model will focus on revealing non-equilibrium electron dynamics.

Archaeology is well-positioned to provide insight regarding this topic due to its focus on extended periods of time and changes throughout these periods. Within this broader context, this project takes a long-term perspective on human-environment relationships to understand how humans have impacted their environment and the ways these interactions helped shape past societal development and collapse. This contribution is salient because it advances the scientific knowledge of the complex relationships between the development and collapse of society and a changing environment. The use of a resilience framework to understand the ecological dimensions of social transformations makes this research applicable across many scientific topics. Additionally, understanding past socioecological dynamics is relevant to modern issues of land-use and management, particularly those concerning biodiversity. Thus, studying the role of diversity in past tropical societies informs modern policy. This project involves collaboration with many entities including national and international academic professionals, undergraduate students from the United States, and individuals from Belize. Furthermore, results from this project will be used to inform community outreach efforts that focus on improving education and literacy in Belize and more broadly.<br/><br/>Dr. Jason Yaeger and Ms. Rebecca Friedel, of The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), will investigate the variables that influence the development and decline of complex societies using a diachronic examination of the intersection of human action with the biophysical world, or human-environment relationships. Using a resilience framework, this project focuses on a case study of societal development and decline in the Mopan River valley, Belize, to test the hypothesis that: the maintenance of high diversity is critical to the resilience of societies in the face of disruptions (e.g., climatic shifts). This hypothesis will be supported if this project finds that: 1) plant diversity is high before and during early climatic disruptions that did not cause a collapse and 2) plant diversity decreases leading up to a later societal collapse that correlates with a climatic disruption. In order to examine the nuances of this hypothesis, this project will study plant diversity dynamics and the human behaviors driving those dynamics using long-term datasets at both landscape and localized scales. Together, these paleoecological and archaeobotanical data will allow for a detailed understanding of human-environment relationships and their role in the resilience of complex social and ecological systems. By integrating these multiple datasets, the researchers will be able to evaluate the main hypothesis that the maintenance of high diversity is critical to the resilience of socioecological systems in the face of perturbations by answering our two research questions: how do the dynamics of plant diversity relate to known sociopolitical and climatic histories of the Mopan valley, and what human behaviors were driving those plant diversity dynamics?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the abundance of available observations, traditional statistical methods under the parametric assumption that a model can be characterized by a pre-specified number of parameters become inadequate and less attractive. Bayesian nonparametric models are attractive in this context which allow the resolution level of the analysis to be determined in a data-driven manner, and provide automatic characterization of uncertainty. The goal of this project is to develop new theory, methodology and computational tools for Bayesian nonparametric inference via Gaussian process priors. <br/><br/>Given the availability of massive data, nonparametric inference offers an attractive framework for flexibly modeling the underlying structure and extracting useful information. For instance, such challenges occur in chemical physics, computational biology, computer vision, engineering, and meteorology. This project aims to lay down a solid methodological, algorithmic, and theoretical foundation for nonparametric inference based on Gaussian processes. In particular, Gaussian process-based approaches tend to be vulnerable to data contamination and have heavy computational costs. To alleviate the high-computational cost of Gaussian process inference procedures, the investigator puts forward two novel computational frameworks which differ at their respective approximating targets as being either the prior or the posterior. To enhance the robustness of Gaussian process inference against data contamination, the investigator proposes a novel class of Bayesian hierarchical models for incorporating this extra measurement error structure, leading to a class of robust Gaussian process inference procedures. The new theoretical development offers valuable insight to experiment-design practitioners into the impact of measurement errors upon prediction and estimation, and provides evidence on the deep connection between computational complexity and statistical learnability. These computational and theoretical frameworks also benefit other disciplines such as applied mathematics, computer science and finance where stochastic processes such as Gaussian processes are routinely used.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These robots are typically no more than a few millimeters in length, and rely on an external power source and control signal. Currently, it is possible to steer the swarm as a whole to a single destination (or perhaps, to a desired average location). However, realizing the full potential benefits of microrobot swarms will require the ability to simultaneously send independent commands, either to individual robots or to small subgroups.  Device designs have previously been explored that respond to different command amplitudes, however this approach quickly becomes impractical as the number of independently addressable robots grows. This scalability problem can be overcome using serial addressing schemes. Here, there are only a few distinct values for the control signal. Each independently addressable subset of robots is associated with a unique sequence of signal values, and will change its behavior only if the control signal contains that specific sequence. This project considers two fundamental issues that arise in implementing such a scheme. First is the need for on-board computation and memory allowing the robots to recognize the unique sequence and to change the robots state based on the detection of such sequence. Second is the need for a propulsive mechanism that couples to the robot state to allow differential guidance towards a target configuration. This project will advance two innovative engineering platforms that meet both needs. The first is electrostatically actuated, operates on a planar substrate, and is suitable for structured tasks such as microassembly. The second is magnetically actuated, operates in a liquid volume, and is suitable for biomedical applications such as drug delivery. The technical aspects of the project are complimented by outreach activities, including an annual microrobotics mobility competition to be held at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation -- a premier robotics conference for academia and industry. The results from this project will enhance the national health, by enabling new diagnostic and therapeutic uses for microrobot swarms. They will also promote the national prosperity, by enabling new classes of microassembly robots.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a practical control scheme to simultaneously control large numbers of microrobots. This will be achieved by using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to electromechanically and magnetically decode a sequence embedded in the single global control signal, and couple the reconfiguration of such sequence to the modification of the individual microrobot trajectories. This on-board sequence decoding will be accomplished through sets of on-board physics-based finite state machines (PFSM) that can accept a control sequence embedded in the control signal and change the behavior of the microrobots accordingly. The project will use both electrostatic and magnetic approaches to implement PFSMs, and to couple their ""accept"" state to the propulsion mechanism to modulate individual trajectories. Sets of stress-engineered electrostatic switches, which will latch in response to a pre-programmed control voltage sequence, will be used to implement PFSM on the electrostatic platform. Electro-permanent magnetic circuits, which change their magnetic moment in response to a sequence of global magnetic field, will be used to implement PFSM on the magnetic platform. The project will develop the theory for PFSM-based multi-microrobot control, construct both electrostatic and magnetic microrobotic PFSM platforms, and validate the concept by implementing the PFSM-based control on swarms of electrostatically and magnetically powered microrobots. The developed theory and approach will pave way for control of large microrobot swarms for numerous biomedical and microassembly applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cost of manufacturing is a serious issue for many of these drugs. One major cost is for the nutrients required by these microbes to grow and produce the drug. The goal of this project is to lower nutrient costs and overall production costs by growing two microbes together. One microbe is photosynthetic. It will utilize sunlight and carbon dioxide to generate nutrients that are then consumed by the other microbe. This removes the need to purchase expensive nutrients, decreasing the cost of drug manufacture. In this project, the target product will be endolysin, a novel treatment against chicken infections that can potentially avoid the widespread use of antibiotics in the poultry industry. The project will also educate students from the high school to the graduate level about co-cultures, preparing them for employment in the growing biomanufacturing industry.<br/><br/>Commercially, filamentous fungi like Aspergillus produce enzymes, antibiotics, and metabolites. Economic analysis reveals that the cost of organic carbon feedstocks is a major cost for these processes. In nature, filamentous fungi are found as part of lichens, which are a symbiosis between a photosynthetic autotroph (photobiont) and its partner, typically a fungus similar to Aspergillus.  The photobiont provides organic carbon, generated using carbon dioxide and sunlight, to partner fungal species. The fungi generate useful biochemicals.  The goal of this project is to implement synthetic lichen co-cultures as a transformative biomanufacturing platform for the production of a novel antimicrobial peptide. Cultivation conditions that allow Aspergillus and cyanobacteria to grow successfully together will be identified. Interactions between the two partners will be characterized using genome scale co-culture models that incorporate transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolic data. This model will be used to determine the media composition and cultivation regime that optimizes the growth and production capabilities of our synthetic lichen.  The synthetic lichen will then generate a novel anti-microbial peptide, endolysin, which could replace antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections in chickens. Overall, the project will develop a low-cost platform for the production of a wide variety of therapeutic molecules and proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More accurate projections of future climate scenarios will require a more detailed understanding of how fast natural processes can remove from Earth's atmosphere the pulse of carbon dioxide that is being produced by society in the industrial era. Models of these processes predict a long tail of the pulse of human-produced carbon dioxide, suggesting that this carbon will have a long-term impact on our climate and society.  As these processes play out over relatively long timescales, such predictions can be verified by looking to the geological record of past events. This project will provide a high-resolution reconstruction of how an ancient natural pulse of carbon dioxide injected into the atmosphere was neutralized by the Earth system in the geological past. As such, this study will provide important perspective from the past on the present rate at which atmospheric carbon can be taken up by natural processes, and hence help Earth scientists make more accurate projections of future climate change.  The researchers will also work with a Geoscience summer residence camp for high school students and non-science major undergraduate students will participate in experiential learning in the field on the impact of climate change. Both activities will contribute to bringing students with diverse backgrounds into STEM and geoscience career paths.<br/>This research will evaluate the evolution of atmospheric CO2 on decadal timescales following a rapid pulse of large amounts of carbon dioxide injected into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions that was part of the Columbia River Basalt Group in the US Pacific Northwest.

Sediments that began to accumulate in the newly formed Lake Clarkia preserve a history of these events in the geological record that can be used to evaluate, in high-resolution, the evolution of the spike of atmospheric CO2 concentrations that resulted from the volcanic eruptions.  The researchers will use micro-XRF scanning of elemental distributions to focus their study on the unoxidized, varve-like sediments.  They will reconstruct the evolution of this natural pulse of CO2 using the properties of stomatal pores in fossil leaves preserved in the sediments, combined with information from the stable isotopes of carbon preserved in the fossil organic matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If animals with parasites are less likely to reach their destinations, then migration may allow populations to escape habitats where parasites build up over time. Understanding how animal migration affects the spread of disease is important to predicting disease risk, including to humans. This study focuses on monarch butterflies as a model system and explores the impacts of parasites on butterfly populations that migrate and populations that have recently lost their migratory habits. This study will also examine how non-migrating populations may influence the risk of having parasites by the migrating forms in areas where they come together. Field and experimental studies will also examine how these microscopic parasites influence how long butterflies live and their flight ability.  Through the high visibility and public appeal of monarchs, this project will support the participation of citizen scientists on a continental scale. The investigators will also mentor and train undergraduate and graduate students and will develop web and classroom based educational materials on host-parasite relationships and animal migration. This work will provide additional opportunities for middle school students and support k-12 activities. Finally, this work will inform efforts to conserve monarch butterflies and our understanding of how migration may influence the importance of parasites across many systems.  <br/><br/>Using a monarch butterflies and protozoan parasite system, the goal of this study is to examine how migratory and sedentary behaviors influence transmission risk and severity of infection. Research activities will integrate (i) an analysis of continent-wide citizen science databases to monitor monarch butterfly abundance and infection; (ii) field and experimental studies to test how monarch migratory behavior depends on non-native milkweeds and infection status, and to quantify parasite transmission rates; (iii) molecular genomics to ask whether genetic changes in sedentary populations might reinforce the loss of migratory behavior; and (iv) mathematical modeling to track how host and parasite populations respond to migratory vs. sedentary strategies. Information on the mixing of non-migrants and migrants, inferred from stable isotope analyses of field-collected monarchs, will inform mathematical models of interacting sedentary and migratory populations, to explore the consequences for disease spread and the persistence of migratory populations. The project will develop theory for how overlapping migration strategies alter, and are themselves affected by, parasite infection, and will shed light on the evolution of migration by characterizing genetic changes that accompany the recent formation of sedentary populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many plant species, including some agricultural crops, have arisen as a result of genome duplication. This natural event results in offspring having genomes that are doubled in content or more as compared to their parents and may have provided opportunities for innovation during plant evolution. However, the short- and long-term consequences of genome duplication in wild plants are not well understood. This research will investigate the natural rate of genome duplication in a wild moss species distributed in North America and Europe. Researchers will create experimental, genome-duplicated offspring in the laboratory to measure how their morphology and reproduction differs from that of their parents. They will then determine if and how duplicated genomes may change over time by comparing the experimental, genome-duplicated offspring  to those that occur naturally. Researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, and support the professional development of early-career researchers. They will also host regional outreach lectures for K-12 teachers about best-practices in evolutionary biology education. Researchers will engage the public online using the citizen-science iNaturalist platform and will create bilingual (Spanish/English) blog posts about moss biology and polyploid evolution. <br/><br/>This project will expand our understanding of the consequences of autopolyploid evolution in plants. Researchers will use as an experimental model organism the moss species Physcomitrium pyriforme (Funariaceae, the Funaria moss family), which harbors a morphologically-diverse complex of seven karyotypes worldwide. The species is annual, bisexual, selfing, and is easily grown in the laboratory. Unlike most other plant model organisms, its genome content can be doubled with precision in vitro to create autopolyploid offspring. Researchers will compare reproductive barriers among naturally-occurring and artificially-induced autopolyploids as well as their homoploid progenitors. Project outcomes will include a phylogeny of the Physcomitrium pyriforme species-complex based on genome sequence data, an estimate of ploidy changes within the complex over evolutionary time and among populations today, and the description of new species. Researchers will further develop the HybPiper bioinformatics data analysis platform and train other US scientists in this method to enhance research capacity.

The core computation of linear algebra is matrix multiplication. In 1968 V. Strassen discovered that the widely used and assumed best algorithm for matrix multiplication  is not optimal. Since then there has been intense research in both developing better algorithms and determining the limits of how much the current algorithms can be improved. There are three parts to the project. The first two are:  practical construction of algorithms for matrix multiplication,  and determining the above-mentioned limits. The third addresses a fundamental question of L. Valiant which is an algebraic analog of the famous P versus NP problem. Valiant asked if a polynomial that can be written down efficiently also must admit an efficient algorithm to compute it. All three parts will be approached using theoretical mathematics not traditionally utilized in the study of these questions (representation theory and algebraic geometry). The practical construction of algorithms in this project could potentially have impact across all scientific computation. The novel use of modern mathematical techniques previously not used in theoretical computer science will enrich both fields, opening new questions in mathematics and providing new techniques to computer science.<br/><br/>The exponent of matrix multiplication, denoted omega, is the fundamental constant that governs the complexity of basic operations in linear algebra. It is currently known that omega is somewhere between 2 and 2.38. Independent of the exponent, practical matrix multiplication (of matrices of size that actually arise in practice) is only around 2.79. For example, matrices of size 1000x1000 may be effectively multiplied by performing  (1000)^{2.79} arithmetic operations. If algorithms to achieve an omega of 2.38 were known, the same matrix operation can be performed using 220 million fewer arithmetic operations. By exploiting representation theory, this project will develop practical algorithms with the goal of lowering this practical exponent. It will also address the exponent by analyzing the feasibility of Strassen's asymptotic rank conjecture and its variants, which are proposed paths towards proving upper bounds on the exponent. The project will also address two aspects of Valiant's conjecture on permanent versus determinant. First, commutative algebra will be used to improve the current lower bound for the conjecture, which has not advanced since 2005. The investigator and a co-author have proven that Valiant's conjecture is true under the restricted model of equivariance. The second aspect will investigate loosening this restriction to weaker hypotheses under which the conjecture is still provable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to develop novel big data frameworks for two compute-intensive tasks, graph mining and matrix/tensor computations, respectively. The two frameworks advance the field of big data analytics by motivating future systems for compute-intensive analytics, and promoting their application in various scientific areas to improve research productivity. The two systems will be available for public use, and can serve several cross-disciplinary projects in computer forensics, computational physics, and bioinformatics. The project includes mentoring graduate students and training K-12 students through summer internships, as well as related new course materials and outreach activities to help the public learn big data technologies. Thus, the project aligns with the NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health and prosperity.<br/><br/>The graph mining system and the matrix/tensor platform share the design of (i) a tailor-made storage subsystem providing efficient and flexible data access, and (ii) a computation subsystem with fine-grained task control for data-reuse-aware task assignment and load balancing. The graph mining system, called G-thinker, aims to facilitate the writing of distributed programs which mine from a big graph those subgraphs that satisfy certain requirements. Such mining problems are useful in many applications like community detection and subgraph matching. These problems usually have a high computational complexity, and existing serial algorithms tackle these problems by backtracking in a duplication-free vertex-set numeration tree, which recursively partitions the search space. G-thinker adopts an intuitive programming interface that minimizes the effort of adapting an existing serial subgraph mining algorithm for distributed execution. The subgraphs to mine are spawned from individual vertices and they grow their frontiers as needed, and memory overflow is avoided by spilling subgraphs to disks when needed. In each machine, vertices and edges shared by multiple subgraphs need only be transmitted and cached once, which minimizes communication (and hence data waiting) so that CPU cores are better utilized. To address the load-balancing problem of power-law graphs, G-thinker explores recursive decomposition and work stealing to allow idle machines to steal subgraphs for mining from heavily-loaded machines. The project also explores a distributed matrix/tensor storage and computing framework, where matrix/tensor partitions are stored in multiple replicas using different storage schemes to efficiently support all kinds of submatrix access operations. This flexible storage scheme offers the upper-layer computations much more opportunities for fine-grained optimizations, including smarter task scheduling and in-situ updates. The use of this framework is exemplified by matrix multiplication and LU factorization. Both of the proposed frameworks can help build a cyberinfrastructure for collaborations with scientists in science, medicine, and industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many questions remain about how organic matter is removed from freshwaters.  A key challenge is that not all organic matter is the same.  Organic matter dissolved in freshwaters is made up of many different compounds. These compounds range in age, source, and chemical composition, all of which can influence how fast they are processed.  To overcome this challenge, researchers will collect real-time sensor data and design field-scale experiments to measure how fast organic matter is removed by streams. The project aims to test hypotheses about what processes control the removal of different types of organic matter from streams and rivers.  This is important because organic matter provides energy that supports food webs, and can pollute downstream ecosystems. Organic matter processing can also determine rates of greenhouse emissions from streams and rivers to the atmosphere. This research will also provide valuable opportunities for high school teachers to engage in investigations that will enhance their ability to meet Next-Generation Science standards.<br/><br/>What processes drive organic carbon removal in streams, and how does organic carbon removal regulate the degree to which running waters are biological reactors versus exporters of organic carbon?  These are key unresolved questions in carbon cycle research.  This project will develop a proof-of-concept approach to test the hypothesis that non-additive effects of mixed organic matter sources (i.e. priming) control organic carbon removal in streams.  Data products will include estimates of organic carbon turnover distance derived from ecosystem metabolism and stream chemistry, as well as empirical measures of organic carbon removal from ecosystem-level experiments that use single-source and mixed organic carbon additions.

Recently, Hurricane Harvey unleashed catastrophic flooding and associated losses on Harris County, Texas. In particular, the area north-west of Houston was overwhelmed by the release of water from the Barker and Addicks Reservoirs. Mitigation of the impacts of coastal urban flooding relies on untangling the hydrological processes under a series of factors - namely, urbanization, weather prediction, and reservoir flow regulation. Therefore, the research goal of this project is to quantify the roles of the different key factors in the Houston area flooding that occurred during Hurricane Harvey. <br/><br/>The specific research objectives are: 1) Quantifying the role of urbanization in exacerbating the flooding; 2) Evaluating the skill of precipitation forecasting, and its impact on streamflow prediction; and 3) Investigating the effectiveness of reservoir flow regulation during the event.The research will take advantage of a high-performance hydrological model with a newly implemented reservoir component. The research using this integrated modeling framework will help close existing knowledge gaps, and will improve future decision making under extreme flood events. First, the additional streamflow attributed to urban development during Harvey will be quantified by comparing hydrological model outputs under a series of historical land covers. Second, the performance of the operational precipitation and streamflow forecasts will be evaluated, and their associated uncertainties will be quantified. Third, the reservoir module of the hydrological model will be optimized under various land cover and precipitation forecast scenarios, such that a better understanding about flow regulation under various uncertainties can be gained. Furthermore, the project not only seeks<br/>to untangle the complex interactions among urbanization, weather prediction, and reservoir flow regulation, it also seeks solutions amidst combined uncertainties. The research approaches and results are target to not only benefit future decision making in the Houston area, but also to bring insight for mitigating floods in other megacities along the world's coastlines.  The educational objective is to enhance environmental sustainability education through involving students at all levels - from K-12 to undergraduate and graduate students. These activities will center on different aspects of Hurricane Harvey, and will engage students according to age and education level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasingly companies need real-time reports of sales, network traffic, anomalies, and other business trends. Internet-connected devices, like cars and industrial plants, demand even more real-time analysis of data. These trends mean database and data analytics platforms must deliver ever-faster performance from machines, a fact that has driven the dramatic interest in scalable multi-node processing systems, like Hadoop and Spark, which distribute the processing of large data sets across clusters of machines. Unfortunately, because of the way these platforms are engineered, they provide shockingly poor utilization of the hardware resources on each node, often times yielding single-node throughput that is thousands of times lower than what the raw hardware is capable of. In this project, an orthogonal direction will be pursued; a system, called Proteus, will be built that will obtain performance that utilizes hardware to the fullest extent possible, focusing on yielding a scalable system that fully utilizes all available computing resources. If successful, this project will have broad impact because databases and data-intensive parallel computing systems are used by millions of enterprises around the world, both on-site and in computing clouds; optimized implementations of these systems that better exploit hardware will improve response times and reduce hardware and energy costs, resulting in billions of dollars of cost savings.<br/><br/>Proteus will parallelize across many cores on a single processor, as well as take advantages of many-core systems such as GPUs and Intel's Xeon Phi.

In computer science, efficient algorithms are generally considered to be the ones whose running time does not increase ""too fast"" when input size grows. ""Scalable algorithms"" are among the most efficient algorithms, because their running time is required to be nearly linear or even sub-linear with respect to the problem size. In other words, their complexity scales gracefully when the input size scales up. In the age of Big Data, efficient algorithms are in higher demand now more than ever before. While big data takes us into the asymptotic world envisioned by the pioneers of computer science, the explosive growth of problem size has also significantly challenged the classical notion of efficient algorithms: Algorithms that used to be considered efficient, according to the traditional polynomial-time characterization, may no longer be adequate for solving today's problems. It is not just desirable, but essential, that efficient algorithms should be scalable. Thus, scalability, instead of polynomial-time computability, should be elevated to the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation, and this will be the focus of algorithm design for network sciences and big data. This project will focus on the design and analysis of scalable algorithms.  One of its primary objective is to build bridges between the area of algorithm design and the fields of network sciences and machine learning.  If successful, the project will help to provide a rigorous algorithmic framework for designing new scalable data and network analysis algorithms.  By focusing on notions of algorithmic efficiency --- such as scalability --- that respect the sensibilities of researchers in these disciplines as to what constitutes a practical algorithm in the age of big data, this project aims to increase the value of theoretical analyses to researchers in these fields.  As this project combines ideas from many disciplines within one coherent research effort, lectures and tutorials presented on the fruits of the project will help cross-fertilize the disciplines within its scope.  The development of theoretical algorithms that might have practical applicability should simplify education in algorithms for students beyond theoretical computer science, and allow discussion of practically important heuristics at early stages of computer science education.

It consists of the fabrication of ultra-short chains of 7 to 200 atoms in length, to test theoretical models and explore the emergence of new magnetic properties. This study provides a broader and deeper understanding of the magnetic behavior of low-dimensional systems and may have a direct impact on the development of a new generation of spintronic devices. This research has an active educational component. The project involves two graduate students who perform research for their Ph.D. thesis topic and two physics undergraduate students per semester. During these activities, students receive training at first synchrotron and neutron facilities and are exposed to state of the art advanced experimental techniques. Community outreach efforts associated with this project involve a partnership with high schools in San Antonio school districts and the production of short videos on different topics related to nanotechnology using a comical approach. These efforts are aimed to increase scientific knowledge in high school students and provide tools for science educators across the United States.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>This research is aimed to study three fundamental problems in magnetic 1D chains: 1) the determination of the extent and persistence of short- and long-range magnetic interactions as a function of the chain's length and defects, 2) the control and modulation of the spin along the chains, and 3) the exploration of proximity effects in varying composition magnetic/non-magnetic metal chains. To achieve these objectives, the PIs have developed a method for the fabrication of macroscopic arrays of 1D chains that allow precise control of their length, composition, and spin. Specifically, this research focuses on the ultra-short (and poorly explored) chain of ~7 to 200 atoms long. Monoatomic and varying composition chains are grown by Organic Molecular Beam Epitaxy (OMBE) using metallo-phthalocyanine (MPc) superlattices (SLs). MPcs are a family of planar organic molecules with one metal atom located in the molecule's center surrounded by organic support.  Many metal ions (Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, and Mn) can be substituted into the MPc giving rise to many isostructural compounds with different electronic (spin) configurations and physical properties. These molecules stack face-to-face giving rise to 1D metal chains when grown by OMBE. The orientation of the chain and its length can be controlled by substrate choice and thickness of the deposited MPc layer respectively. Moreover, using a SL structure, the chain composition, and spin can be varied by intercalating other magnetic and non-magnetic MPc layers. This project includes structural characterization (XRD and HRTEM) and magnetic measurements (SQUID, VSM, and AC susceptibility) in a broad temperature/field. Synchrotron techniques such as XMCD are used to obtain element-selective magnetic measurements and electronic configuration of the metals ions forming the varying composition chains. NEXAFS and DFT calculations allow determining the spin configuration of these elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Adam Gazzaley at the University of California, San Francisco, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist examining the neural mechanisms that predict cognitive and brain plasticity in older adults. Cognitive control comprises a set of neural processes that are critical for goal-directed behavior. Non-pathological declines in cognitive control functions are common in healthy older populations, such as pronounced distractibility during working memory performance. There have also been numerous efforts to develop non-invasive methods to enhance cognition in aging, such as cognitive training interventions. However, there is typically heterogeneity in the magnitude of cognitive and neural plasticity across older adults, both in terms of cognitive abilities and training outcomes. The proposed research seeks to identify neural predictors of these individual differences in plasticity in healthy older adults. This work provides important advances in our understanding of the neural mechanisms of cognitive declines in aging and, importantly, offers methods to ameliorate declines in an optimal, personalized manner. <br/>  <br/>The proposed research uses fMRI, functional connectivity, and cognitive training to identify neural predictors of individual differences in plasticity in older adults. The project builds on previous lines of work by examining the predictive relationship between brain network properties and (1) short-term plasticity as assessed during cognitive control tasks that tap aspects of selective attention and working memory and (2) long-term plasticity as assessed by training-related cognitive gains. The central hypothesis of this project is that cognitive and neural plasticity in older adults can be predicted by aspects of brain network organization, in particular brain network modularity, a metric that quantifies the degree to which brain regions belonging to the same sub-network are more connected to each other than the rest of the network. The expected outcomes of this research plan are significant because they contribute to our understanding of the neuroscience of cognitive plasticity and, importantly, how these functions can be improved in older adults. More broadly, the outcomes of this proposal further our mechanistic understanding of how properties of large-scale brain networks support complex behaviors. It is anticipated that the outcomes of this proposal serve as a foundation to develop targeted, personalized interventions to enhance cognitive control in older populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Survey data have shown that compared to individuals in other countries, Americans display higher tolerance toward outcome inequality and more aversion to redistributive policies. One influential explanation for this phenomenon is that Americans tend to believe they have been living in a mobile society in which individual success is only modestly determined by family background. However, considerable research shows that such perceptions of social mobility are not aligned with reality. This project will test whether correcting  misperceptions of social mobility can alter attitudes toward inequality and redistribution. By receiving accurate information about social mobility in the United States, individuals who turn out to have overestimated (underestimated) mobility will become less (more) tolerant of economic inequality and demand more (less) redistribution. Findings of this project will contribute to our understanding about social mobility and inequality by highlighting the importance of individual subjective perceptions, and provide input into social policies regarding redistribution.  <br/><br/>The project will test hypotheses using an online survey experiment. Recruited subjects will first answer a series of survey questions regarding their perceptions of social mobility in the United States relative to some other developed countries. Subjects in the treatment group, but not in the control group, will immediately receive correct answers to these questions. All subjects, regardless of treatment status, will be asked to report their attitudes toward inequality and redistribution. Hypotheses suggest there will be attitudinal shifts when individual misperceptions are corrected. Six hundred subjects will be recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Another 1,000 subjects will be recruited via a Qualtrics Online Sample, which will resurvey participants after one week of the initial contact to evaluate if the treatment effects persist. This research design allows causal inferences because the experiment randomly assigns subjects to conditions, which improves upon prior studies on similar topics using correlational designs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems often involve multiple decision-making agents interacting over a network and form a subset of so-called cyber-physical-human systems. Examples of such systems include smart grid, connected and autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing, and mixed human-automata systems. Recent advances in technology have made these systems increasingly pervasive in a broad range of applications. Effective design of these systems requires interactions among experts from engineering, economics, and social sciences as well as industry. This forms the basis for organizing the 7th Midwest Workshop on Controls and Game Theory on April 28 - 29, 2018 in East Lansing, MI, where leading experts on controls, optimization, game theory, economics and computation from the Midwestern states are brought together to facilitate interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary research interactions and collaborations. <br/><br/>The purpose of the workshop is to facilitate and enhance research discussions and collaborations among experts in a broad range of disciplines, including biology, economics, and engineering. The workshop has a broader agenda than the previous editions and involves an increased participation from industry. The invited speakers are leading experts in the areas of controls, game theory, applied probability, computation, dynamical systems, economics, and optimization. The three sub-themes, (i) networked control systems, (ii) application of game theory and optimization to societal systems, and (iii) connected and autonomous vehicles, ensure that the broad agenda of the workshop is focused both on theory and application of cyber-physical-human systems. The workshop also includes a poster session in which students and postdocs present their current research. The feedback and mentoring on their research from the leading experts will tremendously benefit these young researchers.

Quantum devices use quantum systems, such as electrons, atoms, photons, to encode and process information. They make it possible to harness the effects of purely quantum phenomena such as superposition (the ability of being in ""two places"" at once) and entanglement (extremely strong connections between two, often quite remote, parts of the system) in order to drastically increase the security and speed of computational devices such as quantum computer. While entanglement became one of the most valuable resources in quantum theory, many of its attributes remain unknown. At present, one of the main technological challenges in quantum information arises from the destructive effects of environment, the effect known as decoherence. Decoherence is a partial loss of quantum information through a channel, in other words, the introduction of noise into the communication. This project will contribute to understanding how these losses may be theoretically predicted and minimized. Students at different levels will be trained through participation in this project. Another educational objective of the project is to promote STEM subjects and improve educational opportunities for students in Houston, TX, middle and high schools, with?main focus on economically disadvantaged neighborhoods.<br/><br/>Two, often overlapping, research directions will be pursued in this project: quantum information theoretic inequalities and dynamics of quantum systems. Quantum information theoretic inequalities, such as monotonicity of quantum relative entropy and strong subadditivity of entropy, are at the core of providing a framework for what is theoretically possible to achieve in quantum information. Dynamics of open quantum systems describing the effects of the environment is notoriously challenging and vital problem.  The principal goals of the project are: (i) to improve understanding of the role of entropy in the quantum setting through a sharpening of the monotonicity of different relative entropies as well as the formulation/derivation of quantum versions of classical information-theoretic inequalities; and (ii) to rigorously describe attributes of quantum entanglement by seeking upper bounds for the speed of generation of entanglement. This investigation is largely motivated by the need to understand and control the decoherence in quantum channels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These constraints are often imposed by real-world data, but it is frequently the case that the relevant data is not completely known to the agent performing the optimization; it is natural to model such settings using probability distributions associated with the data. In such analyses, the constraints associated with the optimization problem are now themselves ""stochastic,"" and a standard goal is to maximize the likelihood of satisfying all the constraints while incurring minimum cost. (As a motivating example, an airline may wish to operate as few flights as possible while ensuring that with 99% probability, no passenger is bumped.)  Apart from modeling uncertainty, optimization with stochastic constraints also provides a way to succinctly model constraints whose standard description is very large; design problems in voting theory, where there are very many voters, are examples of this kind.  This project studies both of these kinds of problems, called stochastic design problems, from a unified new perspective based on techniques from computational complexity theory. The project also trains graduate students who will achieve fluency both in complexity theory and in optimization, and will promote cross-disciplinary activities between operations research and theoretical computer science. <br/> <br/>The motivating insight which underlies this project is that Boolean function analysis -- a topic at the intersection of harmonic analysis, probability theory, and complexity theory -- provides a useful suite of techniques for stochastic design problems. The investigators will study two broad topics. The first one is on chance-constrained optimization:  In problems of this sort, one is given a set of stochastic constraints and the aim is to satisfy all the constraints with at least a certain fixed threshold probability. While previous work on such problems has typically achieved computationally efficient algorithms by relaxing the actual set of constraints, the investigators will focus on algorithms which exactly satisfy the original given set of stochastic constraints. This line of work will address the chance-constrained versions of fundamental optimization problems such as bin packing, knapsack, and linear programming. The second broad topic is that of inverse problems in social choice theory:  Game theorists use so-called ""power indices"" to measure the influence of voters in voting schemes. A basic algorithmic problem is to design efficient algorithms for the inverse problem, in which, given a set of prescribed power indices, the goal is to construct a voting game with these indices. The investigators will study questions such as (a) to what extent is a given voting scheme specified by its power indices? (b) what is the complexity of exactly reconstructing an unknown target voting game given its power indices? (c) when and to what extent is reconstruction possible in a partial information setting?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In spite of an overall revenue growth rate of more than 70% per year, cryo-EM sample preparation remains an area that has yet to see any major technological breakthroughs commercialized in the past decade.  In fact, the current industry solution is reported to have a failure rate of > 95%.

Furthermore, it offers scientists the novel ability to control the thickness of the vitrified aqueous layer and, overall, more control over the sample vitrification process.

Recognition of individual appearance in animals can have consequences for choosing a mate, and consequently the trajectory of a species' evolution, as well.  On the one hand, evolution is typically believed to reduce the variation of individual appearance within a species. On the other, evolution has been shown to favor individuality when it promotes recognition.  This project seeks to better understand these seemingly contrasting consequences of evolution through experiments with paper wasps, insects commonly used to study the evolution of behavior.   The research will focus on a paper wasp species with highly individual facial patterns, and investigates how facial variation is encoded in its genes, how it is maintained, and to what extent natural selection favoring individuality contributes to divergence of populations to create new species. This project will also promote science education through a collaboration with the Sciencenter of Ithaca, NY and the local state park system.<br/><br/>The proposed work will study the selective and demographic processes shaping patterns of diversity in a uniquely tractable paper wasp. The color patterns of Polistes fuscatus wasps mediate individual recognition among co-nesting queens and show dramatic variation both within and between populations. Previous work has demonstrated that the color pattern diversity in P. fuscatus is the result of selection for individuals to advertise their identity and facilitate recognition. The extreme color pattern diversity, relatively simple genetic architecture of color variation, small genome size and abundant populations make these wasps ideal for addressing fundamental questions regarding the maintenance of phenotypic and genetic diversity in recognition systems. This powerful system will be used to investigate four major topics using a combination of comparative, population and functional genomics approaches coupled with detailed phenotyping of specimens: (1) What is the genetic architecture of individual identity signals? (2) How do phenotypic diversity and genetic architecture interact to determine patterns of genetic diversity? (3) What are the roles of selective and demographic forces in shaping patterns of phenotypic diversity? (4) Does selection on recognition systems lead to the maintenance of variation or rapid turnover in diversity across time and space?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It was estimated that approximately two-thirds of global cell-phones are being used in the developing world (e.g. Africa, Asia). Therefore, sensitive biomedical devices integrated with smart-phones would yield a promising sensing system and introduce great impact on point-of-care diagnostics in developing countries and resource-limited areas. This proposal aims to develop a monochromatic structured illuminated plasmonic spatial interferometer suitable for highly sensitive sensing on digital cameras (e.g. on desktop microscopes and smart phones). The enhanced sensing performance is enabled by the super resolution strategy of structured illumination integrated with the plasmonic nanostructure developed in this project, which overcomes the resolution limit of the digital cameras. When successfully developed, such highly sensitive interferometers will allow a variety of biosensing applications at a much lower cost, with great societal impact on real time and in situ monitoring of global environmental (e.g. water) quality, liquid-food borne illnesses and personal health conditions. This research will be closely integrated with educational programs in the departments of Electrical Engineering and Biomedial Engineering at University at Buffalo. It will significantly impact the Electrical Engineering and Biomedial Engineering curriculum with its emphasis on experiential learning, and will provide an excellent educational opportunity for graduate and undergraduate student training of the next generation of researchers, educators and global leaders. The two PIs will provide excellent opportunities for undergraduate and graduate training in theoretical modeling, nanofabrication, miniaturized system design and optical super resolution image processing. The main goals of this educational and outreach program are to enhance the educational communication and collaboration, improve the participation of graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge researches, for outreach to K-12 students by organizing engineering summer campus, and provide opportunities for under-represented groups.<br/><br/> While Surface Plasmon Resonance systems are currently used for label-free sensing, they remain inadequate for use in portable systems as the commercial instrumentation is expensive, complex, bulky and inconvenient for the integration with microfluidic platforms. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop low-cost, compact, and high performance sensor systems for the ever-increasing sensing applications. Nanoplasmonic sensors are attractive miniaturized platforms to potentially meet these requirements. However, because nanoplasmonic sensors are mostly based on broadband wavelength shift interrogation which requires expensive spectrometers, high throughput sensing is still very challenging. This proposal will develop a plasmonic spatial interferometer structure to transfer the broadband wavelength peak/valley shift to the spatial interference pattern shift at a monochromatic wavelength such that the shift can be directly imaged by digital cameras on microscopes and smart-phones without the need of expensive spectrometers. To further enhance the sensing performance of the proposed system, the super resolution structured illumination strategy will be integrated into the sensor design by introducing a nanopatterned reference slit to generate Moire fringes with low spatial frequency information. This strategy enables a resolution much higher than the resolution limits of the optical imager system, thus allowing ultra-small spatial shift (sub-resolution-limit) to be observable even with portable cameras. The proposed system does not require spectrometer or angular tunable prism coupling system, leading to a significant reduction in device cost and instrumental complexity, especially when realized on smart-phone-based microscope systems. The potential of this sensing system will be demonstrated through the super-resolution-resolved peak/valley shift of 50 nm using inexpensive digital imagers, corresponding to an ultra-small sensing resolution approaching the performance of commercial bulky surface plasmon resonance imager systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Every year, 30,000 men and women are diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which has a 5-year survival rate of 17.6 %. The prognosis for these patients is poor. Currently, there are no curative treatments for these patients. The current standard-of-care only increases overall survival by months and has toxic side effects, with a cost to the US healthcare system of $1.5B per year. This technology is based on the inherent feature of bacteria to colonize solid tumors throughout the body in ratios of 100,000 to 1 compared to healthy tissue. Due to this specificity, the developed bacterial platform has the potential to increase dosage specifically in tumors, while reducing toxic side effects in healthy tissues. This platform will be a toolbox that can target intracellular pathways that are currently considered undruggable and deliver potent doses of biologicals directly into tumor cells. The affinity of bacteria for solid tumors, independent of organ localization, enables the extension of this delivery method to other hard-to-treat tumor types, such as pancreas, ovarian and gastric cancer. <br/><br/>Systemic cancer therapies have many obstacles, such as stability in the blood, traversing the cellular membrane, internalization and endosomal release. These processes impede the use of RNAi and peptides in humans and hamper the targeting of intracellular pathways with monoclonal antibodies. The development of a bacterial drug delivery platform can optimize drug potency in tumors and reduce side effects in healthy tissue. In this SBIR phase I, efficacy of this platform will be measured in HCC by targeting intracellular pathways essential for cell survival, for which no systemic therapy exists. A bacterial strain will be created according to FDA guidelines that can be manufactured reliably without loss of activity. An optimized preservation protocol will be developed to ensure maximal bacterial fitness and maximal delivery efficacy after administration. This bacterial delivery system has the potential to accelerate the translation of fundamental cancer research into clinical therapies.

Existing diagnostic systems require 2-6 days to identify the bacteria, which delays treatment using appropriate antibiotics. Sepsis, which is often caused by a bacterial infection, contributes to up to half of all hospital deaths in the US largely due to complications arising from delays or inappropriate treatment (which is mainly because of lack of information regarding the infection-causing bacteria). It is the most expensive hospital-treated condition in the United States ? representing $20.3 billion in healthcare costs. The proposed system aims to sharply reduce the time to provide information needed by physicians, enabling them to initiate treatment using the appropriate antibiotic rapidly. This is expected to lead to significant reductions in costs, complications, and mortality. Further, by eliminating the need for culturing, new insights into bacterial behavior can be acquired contributing to additional fundamental knowledge of bacteria. This knowledge will aid antibiotic discovery efforts, improve understanding of mechanisms of drug resistance, support new biomanufacturing processes through faster detection of bacterial contamination of pharmaceutical products and foods, and characterization of the microbiome.<br/><br/>The challenges of rapid bacterial identification are primarily in two areas ? sample preparation, that eliminates the need for culturing, and multiplex identification, to cover the diverse range of bacterial species capable of causing infection. The proposed work is based on leveraging the differential response between bacteria and the cells in a sample matrix to selectively break down the sample matrix, but not bacteria, such that the largest lysis debris is smaller than intact bacteria. The debris is subsequently separated from intact bacteria using a size-based technique enabling rapid isolation of a broad range of bacteria directly from the sample. A novel Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy system is then used to identify the isolated bacteria at clinically relevant concentrations. No bacteria-specific reagents are employed. The proposed Phase I work addresses the highest risk technical hurdles in the process. Isolating and detecting low concentration of bacteria directly from blood is accomplished through the three objectives of this project that optimize the purification and bacterial recovery from the sample, identification accuracy, and performance of the integrated system relative to the traditional culturing-based method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation has the potential to revolutionize the way pharmaceuticals that do not dissolve in water are manufactured. Manufacturing processes are available to place these pharmaceuticals within small spherical containers that are known as liposomes. However, the high cost to make pharmaceutical-loaded liposomes makes accessibility to these pharmaceuticals difficult for individuals and communities with limited resources. Matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation involves layer-by-layer deposition of drug-loaded thin films on three-dimensional printed needles for delivery with greater precision and lower cost than current technologies. New combinatorial chemistry, drug design, and drug screening mechanisms have led to the development of a large number of new water-insoluble pharmaceuticals. This research advances the production mechanisms for these drugs thus benefiting the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and improving patient quality of life. This GOALI project involves several disciplines including nanotechnology, laser technology, pharmaceutical science, manufacturing science, and materials science. It helps broaden participation of women and underrepresented minorities in research through activities at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and local schools. Collaborations between North Carolina State University and Lynntech, a company that develops medical products, propels commercialization and clinical translation of nanomanufacturing of pharmaceuticals using matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation technology.<br/><br/>The matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation nanoscale manufacturing process can overcome several limitations associated with conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing techniques such as cost and delivery precision. By this process, drug-containing thin films can be formed on drug delivery substrates with excellent control over coating thickness, roughness, and homogeneity. This award overcomes several scientific barriers to realize the full potential of matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation for processing pharmaceuticals that do not dissolve in water. This research is to fill the knowledge gap on the relationships among processing parameters, structure, chemical properties, and biological functionality for a drug that can be used to treat a common type of skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma) as well as fungal infections. The development of layered nanocomposite films, which extend the amount of time over which the drug is released, has the potential to reduce the number of times that a drug needs to be administered for effective treatment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge arises especially in middle school and high school algebra; far too often, students in algebra courses come away with only a moderate level of skill at procedures (e.g., equation solving) with almost no conceptual understanding of why these procedures work. This lack of deep understanding is unfortunate, because algebra is an important stepping stone to advanced mathematics as well as to future educational and employment opportunities. Thus, there is a great need for algebra instruction that helps students acquire well-integrated knowledge of key concepts and problem-solving procedures. This project tackles this issue using, as a platform, a software-based intelligent tutoring system that will extend an existing tutoring system for algebra. The new, enhanced tutoring system will support both practice in solving equations and new conceptually-oriented algebra activities. It will provide detailed and targeted guidance that adapts to individual students' errors, strategies, and developing algebra knowledge. Lab-based and classroom studies will investigate three key questions: (1) What mix of conceptual and procedural activities best helps students acquire deep skill and conceptual knowledge of algebra? (2) How frequently should students shift back and forth between the two types of activities? (3) How effective is the new tutoring system compared to commonly-used software, namely, Khan Academy, or a standard intelligent tutoring system that provides procedural practice only? The project will lead to new knowledge about how to create effective instruction for middle school and high school algebra, together with new intelligent tutoring software that embodies this knowledge.<br/><br/>Based on past research, it is commonly accepted that in many domains, gains in conceptual knowledge can lead to gains in procedural knowledge, and vice versa. Further, there is some evidence that instruction that shifts back and forth between conceptually-oriented activities and procedurally-oriented activities is especially effective. However, it is not yet known what sorts of activities best support the development of conceptual knowledge, or how they should be integrated with activities that target learning of procedures so that students might make connections between the two. To address these issues, the project will extend existing tutoring system for equation solving (called Lynnette) with conceptual activities, based on past research that suggests that worked examples, self-explanation, visual representations (namely, bar diagrams), and activation of prior knowledge can be effective for promoting gains in conceptual knowledge. In doing so, this will leverage an established technical infrastructure for intelligent tutoring systems research and development, called CTAT/Tutorshop. The project will conduct two lab studies and two classroom studies to investigate what mix of conceptually-oriented activities is the most effective complement to the system's current set of procedurally-oriented activities, how frequently students should shift back and forth between procedurally- and conceptually-oriented activities, and how effective the resulting tutoring system is, compared to two control conditions in which students work with commonly used types of software for algebra learning (Khan Academy and Lynnette). The project will generate new knowledge about how to design effective instruction that helps students acquire well-integrated conceptual and procedural knowledge that is effective in real educational settings. This knowledge could lead to better, more conceptually-oriented instruction in algebra, and it has the potential to improve instruction in other STEM learning environments. The project will also create a new intelligent tutoring system for algebra that is much more effective than current systems. The system will be made available to teachers and schools free of charge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Shock wave focusing occurs frequently both in nature and in a variety of man-made applications. It takes place when a shock wave propagates through a non-uniform or moving media and reflects from curved surfaces or through reflections with other shock waves. Extreme conditions created at the focal region - resulting in very high pressures and temperatures - can be either beneficial as in the case of shock wave lithotripsy to remove kidney stones or in inertial confinement fusion for energy generation, or detrimental as in the case of superbooms (a type of sonic boom). As the shock wave emerges from the focal region, after the shock focusing event, the shape of the shock is often fundamentally altered. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the shock focusing process, and how to control it, is critical to fully understand its consequences and how to best enhance or mitigate it as needed depending on the application at hand. Today, three-dimensional effects of shock wave focusing are not yet fully understood. Therefore, the principal goal of this research project is to develop a deeper understanding of the key factors that govern shock wave focusing in three dimensions using an experimental approach. This project will also provide opportunities to learn about shock wave dynamics for undergraduate students and high school students, particularly from underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this research is to experimentally study shock wave focusing using an exploding wire setup capable of producing multiple simultaneous shock waves in two or three dimensions. Ultra high-speed photography coupled with visualization techniques will be used to determine the conditions when regular shock wave reflection transitions into irregular shock wave reflection. Another goal is to quantify the amount of energy focusing at the focal region given the competition between the weakening of each individual shock wave as it propagates radially outward from the exploding wire and the strengthening due to Mach shock generation.The proposed research is expected to lead to a much enhanced understanding of the principles of shock wave dynamics, and shock wave focusing, especially for three dimensional shocks with decaying fluid properties behind them ? in addition to providing a wealth of data to help verify numerical frameworks dealing with shock focusing scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AB diblock polymers are formed by chemically bonding together two distinct polymer chains end-to-end. At sufficiently low temperatures, a mixture of polymers A and B will separate into two distinct phases, much the same as the way oil and water separate into two layers when salad dressing sits in the refrigerator. Such macroscopic phase separation is not possible for a melt of diblock polymers; owing to the chemical bond between the two blocks, the furthest the two blocks can separate is the length of the polymer chain. As a result, diblock polymer melts undergo microphase separation into ordered structures with nanometer length scales set by the size of the blocks. The PIs will investigate the microphase separation that occurs for the case where the diblock polymer is compositionally asymmetric, that is when the volume fraction of A is small, and conformationally asymmetric, i.e. where the elasticity of the A block and the B block differ. The compositional asymmetry leads to a system where spheres of A form inside a continuous matrix of B. For decades, it was assumed that the stable ordered state of sphere-forming, microphase separated diblock polymers was a body-centered cubic structure, a type of close-packed structure analogous to that seen in stacks of cannon balls or oranges. Recently, experiments and theory have demonstrated that conformationally asymmetric diblock polymers can also form considerably more complicated packings known as Frank-Kasper and Laves phases. These phases were first seen in metallic alloys, where the atoms have different sizes, and the corresponding phases in diblock polymers involve the packing of spherical particles of different sizes formed by the spontaneous self-assembly of the polymers as they are cooled. This project will determine whether simplified theories based on the geometry of these packings can explain their origin in diblock polymers. Subsequent work will explore the role of the exchange of polymers between different particles, aiming to explain experimental results showing that thermal processing can produce different particle packings. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop a connection between the formation of these complex phases in diblock polymers and their emergence in the different context of metallic alloys. Additional broader impacts will emerge from the development of computational tools required to study this problem and their release to the community at large. Graduate students and undergraduate students will receive advance training in polymer physics and, more broadly, materials science through their participation in the research activities of this project. The results will be communicated to the general public through a collated collection of images of complex phases on a dedicated website. These complex phases possess an aesthetic beauty, embodied by the well-known Penrose tiling. The image collection will not only include images of these complex phases generated by the project, but an explanation of their origins in the context of block polymers.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports computational and theoretical research and education aiming to advance understanding of the stability of complex phase formation in sphere-forming diblock polymers. The research in this project consists of two parts. In the first part, the PIs will assess the ability of geometric theories such as sphericity and the diblock foam model to predict the relative stability of Frank-Kasper and Laves phases in diblock polymers. The results of these calculations will be compared to the predictions from field-theoretical models for diblock polymers. In the second part of the project, the PIs will use dissipative particle dynamics simulations to determine the effect of chain exchange on the transitions between different complex phases during thermal processing of block polymer melts. The field-theoretic results will be included as part of the ""Broadly Accessible Self-Consistent Field Theory"" website, which includes software for performing these calculations and solved examples emerging from research projects using the software. These computational results will be combined with data-processing tools to produce slices through various planes, which will provide the image collection for the public outreach component of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Failure of this critical protective barrier between the contents of the bloodstream and rest of the brain can cause both short- and long-term problems because of increased invasion of the brain by disease causing agents. The causes of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, as well as the potential of repetitive injury to more severely degrade the blood-brain barrier is poorly understood.  There are very few non-animal laboratory models that copy the mechanical, structural and functional complexities of the blood-brain barrier that can be used to study traumatic brain injury. This project will use a new non-animal (benchtop) model of the blood-brain barrier to study its breakdown after repetitive traumatic injury. The project will advance health by determining the biological and structural causes for reduced barrier function in the brain following traumatic injury.  The educational and outreach work in the project is centered on engaging high-school students who will use the latest technologies of Biomedical Manufacturing and Innovation in a week-long summer camp. <br/><br/>This project will advance fundamental insights within the field of blood-brain barrier mechanobiology, specifically the understanding of the role of strain, deceleration and repeated injury, in causing altered structure and dysfunction of the blood brain barrier and the overall neurovascular unit. Three-dimensional in vitro models of the blood-brain barrier neurovascular unit (organ-chips) incorporating neural and microvascular cell types, and capillary fluid flow will be designed and engineered. These organ-chip constructs will be subject to single or multiple traumatic injuries in custom-designed bioreactors to quantify and model the temporal evolution of blood-brain barrier breakdown as a function of injury magnitude, number of impacts and time between impacts. This project will thus provide important insights into the mechanoregulation of blood-brain barrier cellular phenotype, metabolism and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These characteristics, also known as functional traits, include features such as length, height, shape, weight, growth rate, sex, and reproductive state. Studying these traits provides insights into how communities of different types of animals come together and how species and communities respond to changes in their environment over time, which is critical for conservation efforts. However, very little information about functional traits is available, and what is available is difficult to combine with other data. How these traits are influenced by environmental changes - such as climate change, pollution, urbanization and human predation - and how they shift over longer timescales are poorly understood, and the need for this information is outstripping the speed with which scientists can collect these data. Digitized collections of animals representing life from the past two million years contain a treasure trove of information about these individuals' functional traits, but these data are stored in multiple places and in different formats. Researchers may have recorded dates differently, for example, or used a variety of terms to describe a single physical feature. Making these data widely available in standardized formats could help scientists study changes in functional traits through time, linking their observations of traits of modern animals to those from fossil and archaeological records. The Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies (FuTRES) project will gather trait data from digitized records; to engage communities of researchers to make these data available, standardized, and useable; and to develop a more complete workflow for using these data in research. <br/><br/>Functional trait data have revolutionized ecology and are transforming paleontology, but acquiring them requires extensive labor, not only in measuring traits but in managing and communicating the resulting data. When trait data are lacking, researchers substitute average values, or other characteristics like behavioral or dietary categories. These substitutes - assigned at the species level - obscure intraspecific changes in traits. FuTRES fills the clear need for informatics tools that give researchers access to existing trait data and a place to store new data as they are generated. FuTRES is assembling a varied collection of existing trait data, building a pipeline that converts data to an integrated, semantically enriched form, and developing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web platform to serve the data. One of the key innovations of FuTRES is the use of ontologies, an information science approach that creates computer-readable definitions of traits and describes the interrelationships of traits, organisms, collecting events, and other entities. In this way, FuTRES will make functional trait data searchable through reference to time, space, and vertebrate anatomy.  FuTRES will also provide access to trait data via popular data portals (e.g., VertNet) and software such as R, opening the data to scientists in biodiversity and other domains. The toolkit will be tested with mammalian use cases that leverage the massive scale of the unlocked data.  In sum, newly created access mechanisms and tools will provide novel approaches for analyses of trait variation across space and time, providing researchers in disparate fields discovery capabilities for relevant data that would otherwise have been invisible to them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first is on random interacting systems of particles, which serve as probabilistic models for phenomena ranging from the spread of infections to the growth of populations of competing organisms. Even the simplest examples of such particle systems are not fully understood. This project is focused on a system in a larger family known as A + B -> 2B models studied by physicists as models for combustion. The system has recently been shown to display surprising behavior on finite and infinite trees, which this project will explore further. The other major question to be pursued is on random trees, another common model throughout the sciences. This project investigates equations arising from random trees whose solutions are related to the existence or nonexistence of certain classifications of trees into categories.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is to study a system of interacting random walks known as the frog model. In this process, inactive particles are placed on a graph. One particle then becomes active and performs a random walk, waking any particles it encounters. These particles then start their own random walks, waking any particles they encounter, and so on. Recent work by the PI has shown that the model exhibits phase transitions between transience and recurrence on infinite trees and between different cover time regimes on finite trees. The project proposes proving the existence of an additional weak recurrence phase on the infinite tree and an intermediate cover time phase on the finite tree. A potential route to this lies in further finer analysis of recursive distributional equations, working first with toy models. The other proposed project explores classifications of trees that follow rules given by automata. The prototypical example is the classification of trees according to whether they contain an infinite binary subtree starting at the root. This classification obeys a recursive rule (namely that a tree is in the class if and only if at least two root child subtrees are) that can be described by a tree automaton. This rule induces a fixed-point equation that one can use to compute the probability of a Galton-Watson tree being in this class. This project will investigate further the relationship between the classifications, the tree automata, and the fixed-point equations. Two approaches to the problem are probabilistic investigation of the random trees and other branching processes arising from them, and the direct analytic investigation of the fixed-point equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Social networks, ecological networks, and the human brain are a few examples of such networks. A feature that these networks of interest have in common, is that they define very large graphs. Algorithms used to compute properties of complete graphs, rapidly become impractical when the graphs under study become very large. Graph sampling thus becomes essential. The research explores a somewhat radical departure from the prior work on graph sampling and is based on the notion of stochastic sampling in irregular sampling grids. In concert with the advancing the scientific goals of the project, the investigators will also jointly develop a short course on graph signal processing and its applications so as to introduce this emerging field to a broad set of students.<br/><br/>While fixed-time sampling is well known, this project focuses on stochastic sampling theory to graph signal processing and, in particular, graph sub-sampling with and without knowledge of the signal. In the case of sampling without signal knowledge, investigators intend to design optimal sub-sampling grids that minimize low frequency energy in a binary signal where investigators intend to develop low computational complexity dither algorithms that closely mimic the ideal patterns. In the case of sub-sampling with signal knowledge, the developed adaptive sub-sampling algorithms will adjust the sampling rate based on the local frequency content of the signal to, thereby, sample at just above the Nyquist rate of the sample within a small region of interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology allows the sample stage and objective lens turret to remain stationary during experiments. It will increase throughput, preserve sensitive samples, enable observation of dynamic events, and reduce training time. The innovation will spur significant discovery in understanding dynamic reactions that occur in in vivo and in vitro microscopy. The initial target market has an estimated gross revenue of $75M. The technology also promises to benefit 3D imaging systems for manufacturing or machine vision, optical coherence tomography, and endoscopic imaging systems by providing high speed and agile focus control. While MEMS are ubiquitous in mobile platforms and the automotive industry for motion sensing, they have not yet permeated other markets or imaging systems to the same extent. With recent advances in fabrication and performance of optical MEMS devices, bringing this type of technology to other platforms can spark greater commercialization of the technology in non-traditional areas. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is foremost the demonstration of a novel optomechanical system with MEMS mirrors for independent control of focusing and zoom in microscopy. MEMS mirrors are a type of varifocus element. They remain stationary while their voltage-controlled, configurable surface shapes allow for fast focusing and attendant correction of spherical aberration. Fast MEMS mirrors, with sufficient diameters for 2x zoom and significant focusing capability, have not previously been demonstrated in literature or commercially. By producing and characterizing fast, large-diameter MEMS mirrors for this project, knowledge of varifocus elements will be advanced. This project will also continue to define standard optical design practices to best utilize varifocus elements, since traditional optical analyses assume fixed focal length lenses or mirrors. The project objectives are three-fold: 1) fabricate large-diameter MEMS mirrors with greater than 40% yield, 2) characterize their focusing range and dynamic behavior, and 3) demonstrate them in a focus and zoom system suitable as a microscopy add-on component.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, children transition out of naps during preschool years. Whether naps should be encouraged in preschools, or eliminated to provide more time for early learning, is not clear. The overarching objective of this proposed research is to examine the role of sleep and brain development on memory during early childhood, specifically as children transition out of naps. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that maturation of memory-related brain regions during this transitional developmental period results in more information being retained in memory without interference. This in turn reduces the need for frequent consolidation, which, ultimately, underlies the transition out of naps. This research will deepen understanding of how sleep benefits learning and memory in healthy children, providing benefit to healthy child care, pre-school education, and children with developmental and mental disorders.<br/> <br/>Sleep-dependent memory consolidation is thought to reflect transfer of memories from the hippocampus to the cerebral cortex. Although we have previously documented changes in memory performance as a result of sleep-dependent consolidation in young children, the neural mechanisms supporting this process have yet to be examined. This gap is problematic as memory and the hippocampal-cortical network both undergo significant developmental change during this period. Our goal is to identify the mechanistic pathway through which brain development and sleep physiology underlie changes in memory during childhood development. To accomplish this, we will obtain measures of brain structure, brain function, sleep physiology, and memory. We hypothesize that age-related changes in the development of the brain and sleep physiology will result in larger and stronger memories. Likewise, we expect increased hippocampal functional connectivity to allow for more efficient memory transfer with sleep, and will be associated with changes in slow wave sleep. We will use models to test the hypothesis that changes in hippocampal structure will precede changes in hippocampal function; these combined changes will lead to changes in sleep patterns; and that improved sleep will improve memory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using modeling, simulation and experimental methods, the formation and stability of gas film in the ECDM of advanced materials will be studied. The topography, mechanical and tribological properties, and composition of the machined surface will be analyzed subsequently. The expected improvement in the machinability of a wide variety of both conductive and nonconductive materials will help in unleashing the full application potential of these materials in biomedical, electronic, automotive, and energy industries. Potential applications in these industries include hip joint prosthesis, electronics packaging, brake linings, and solid oxide fuel cells. The multi-disciplinary approach and results of this study can be extended to other electrical machining processes. The outcome of this project will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate courses, and training and learning within female and underrepresented minorities. The results of this research will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, presentations at professional society meetings, and YouTube videos.<br/><br/>Through this research, fundamental knowledge on the mechanism of gas film formation and stability during the electrochemical discharge machining process will be generated by conducting analytical and experimental investigations to understand the effect of thickness and stability of the gas film on the surface integrity changes in machined parts. Critical insight into the rate of gas bubble formation, the rate of coalescence, and the gas film thickness will be acquired by molecular dynamics simulations to produce stable and thin gas film. Finite element simulations coupling electrical, chemical and thermal aspects of ECDM will be pursued to investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of boundary layers during gas film formation. Multi-physics based mathematical models will be developed to predict the gas film thickness, discharge energy and surface roughness in ECDM.

This includes messenger RNAs that encode data for making proteins and small RNAs that play important regulatory roles.  Plant biologists continue to discover exciting, novel roles for small RNAs during plant growth, development, and responses to the environment.  Like nearly all molecules in cells, the ability of small RNAs to carry out their functions depends on their location and quantity.  However, due to their small size, it has been particularly challenging to detect and locate small RNAs. In plants, current methods can only detect one, or at most, two small RNAs at a time. This project develops a new technique called qRNA-PAINT to detect, quantify, and localize tens to hundreds of small RNAs in a single sample, simultaneously. qRNA-PAINT makes it possible to examine the complex relationships of small RNAs inside of a plant cell with super-resolution precision.  Due to the wide-ranging role of small RNAs, this technique will have broad impacts on scientists seeking to answer fundamental biological questions in both plants and animals. Insights into the roles of small RNAs in plant signalling pathways may be translatable to increasing crop plant productivity and resistance to environmental stress and pathogens.<br/><br/>In the current age of genomics, there is a wealth of expression data for small RNAs.  However, methods to examine the subcellular, cellular, and even tissue level localization of small RNAs are limited. This has made it challenging to examine the relationship of different RNAs, such as miRNAs, siRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNA targets.  This proposal will fully develop the qRNA-PAINT method to examine the relationship of tens to hundreds of different small RNAs. qRNA-PAINT is a modification of the exchange points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (exchange-PAINT) method, which has been used to detect up to ten different protein targets.  It accomplishes this by using the stochastic binding of dye labeled imager oligonucleotides to docking strands attached to antibodies.  The qRNA-PAINT method does not use antibodies, but rather just locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes connected to the docking strands for exchange-PAINT.  Consequently, it potentially can be massively multiplexed for numerous small RNAs, to examine signaling networks in single cells and tissue types. The maize anther will be used as the model system and qRNA-PAINT data will complement the already available extensive set of sequencing data.  Furthermore, qRNA-PAINT will be combined with exchange-PAINT (for proteins) to examine the relative localization of protein machinery to study the biogenesis of different types of small RNAs. Ultimately, it will be used to answer outstanding questions on the spatio-temporal regulation of small RNA biogenesis and signaling networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current search technologies are limited because they are able to find many relevant documents, but cannot extract and organize the information content of these documents or suggest new scientific hypotheses based on the organized content. Natural Language Processing (NLP) based text mining strategies are a recognized means to approach this problem, but most scientists do not have the expertise or time to take use them. In addition, the lack of interoperability among NLP tools as well as the data in repositories scattered around the web are barriers to sharing workflows, resources, and results.

Publicly available software (such as Google) is not geared toward publication data, and in-house tools are fragile and deliver only a fraction of relevant results. The main objective of this project is, therefore, to (1) identify the requirements for an easy-to-use platform for mining information from scientific publications and (2) deploy facilities that meet these needs. To achieve this goal this project will extend the already existing NSF-funded LAPPS Grid to include means to access a broad range of interoperable NLP tools, large bodies of publication data and lexical and ontological resources, and, crucially, to rapidly adapt existing software to new domains and evaluate results. This project will also leverage enhancements to the NSF-funded Galaxy platform for interactive data exploration and extended access to NSF hardware resources (XSEDE machines including Stampede, Bridges, and Jetstream). By providing access to services for mining scientific publications and lowering the barriers to entry resulting from licensing, redistribution, and intellectual property concerns, this project provides capabilities that were previously unavailable to scientists. Researchers are able to perform large-scale text mining using an HPC infrastructure through a web-based interface without the need to know about underlying infrastructure. Additionally, providing iterative domain adaptation capabilities enables scientists to easily adapt existing services to specialized areas without configuring or installing additional components. The ability to examine both explicit and implicit information scattered across massive repositories of publications will undoubtedly result in new observations and insights.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Better seismic risk assessment requires quantitative knowledge of fault distribution and propagation. The discovery of slow slip events, those that occur over hours to months instead of seconds, at convergent plate boundaries, like in the Pacific Northwest, provides new opportunities to study the mechanics of earthquakes and other fault instabilities. Seismic observations link slow slip events to high fluid pressure within the fault zones but how this works mechanically is still unclear. Recent studies in the lab that emulate these conditions show that increasing pore pressure slow down fault growth. This project looks to advance these experiments to improve our understanding of the mechanics of slow faulting under high pore pressure. The work has broader impacts on our understanding of seismic hazards at coastal plate boundaries as well as other areas that see this type of complex faulting. The researcher will also provide a research experience for an undergraduate, and conduct outreach to a nearby high school to bring students into a scientific lab. The project supports a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student.<br/><br/>The researchers hypothesize that dilatant hardening at crack tip can cause deformation to migrate, which results in delocalized fracturing and slow fault propagation. To test this hypothesis, the work enables deformation experiments using an X-ray transparent deformation apparatus to record the real-time fault growth. The state-of-the-art dynamic microtomography imaging will elucidate the fault nucleation process and growth pattern in a deforming rock at in-situ conditions. They will also incorporate dilatancy hardening into the damage model to simulate the effect of pore pressure on fault propagation. Comparison of the 3-D microstructure generated by numerical simulations and the time-lapse tomography images will provide new insights into deformation mechanisms.

In this and many other ways, groups are deeply related to geometric and topological spaces, and are spaces in their own right.  Geometric group theory grows out of this insight.  The research in this project centers on subgroups of mapping class groups, which are infinite groups arising from symmetries of topological surfaces.  Their subgroups include all right-angled Artin groups, which are themselves fundamental objects.  For example, notice that order never matters in addition, always matters in concatenation (a songbird is not a birdsong), and only sometimes matters in multiplication (no between ordinary numbers, yes between the matrices of linear algebra).  Right-angled Artin groups include and interpolate between the first two extremes.  Both mapping class groups and right-angled Artin groups are important in geometric group theory, and rich enough that their study has applications to larger families of groups, as well as to low-dimensional manifolds.  As fundamental mathematics, work in geometric group theory has potential for practical benefits to society.  The work of geometric group theorists, building road maps for groups, has had ramifications to cryptography, which is based on the difficulty of retracing one's steps.  In addition, right-angled Artin groups are relevant to any algorithmic task in which order matters between some steps and not between others, a well-documented example being robot motion planning. <br/><br/>This project is a geometrically-oriented investigation of three interrelated families of subgroups of mapping class groups: right-angled Artin groups, normal subgroups, and 'convex cocompact' or 'stable' subgroups. The goal of the project is to advance knowledge both specific to mapping class groups and relevant to geometric group theory overall. Among normal subgroups, the project aims to understand the spectrum from free, infinite-rank normal subgroups (whose group of automorphisms is large as possible), to normal subgroups with automorphism group consisting of the mapping class group itself (that is, as small as possible), with right-angled Artin groups appearing as normal subgroups between these two extremes.  Objects with automorphism group equal to the mapping class group can be considered geometric models for the mapping class group. This work aims to further elucidate what such geometric models may be. The project also aims to advance the study of convex cocompact subgroups of the mapping class group, and their generalizations to other kinds of groups, including right-angled Artin groups, and more generally, groups acting on CAT(0) spaces.  The approaches to be employed rely on group actions on various interesting spaces, including CAT(0) cube complexes, curve complexes of surfaces, projection complexes, and ""rotating family"" machinery within groups acting on hyperbolic spaces. The latter two are axiomatic constructions, so that results about mapping class subgroups acting on these complexes readily translate to more general settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many plant species, including some agricultural crops, have arisen as a result of genome duplication. This natural event results in offspring having genomes that are doubled in content or more as compared to their parents and may have provided opportunities for innovation during plant evolution. However, the short- and long-term consequences of genome duplication in wild plants are not well understood. This research will investigate the natural rate of genome duplication in a wild moss species distributed in North America and Europe. Researchers will create experimental, genome-duplicated offspring in the laboratory to measure how their morphology and reproduction differs from that of their parents. They will then determine if and how duplicated genomes may change over time by comparing the experimental, genome-duplicated offspring  to those that occur naturally. Researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, and support the professional development of early-career researchers. They will also host regional outreach lectures for K-12 teachers about best-practices in evolutionary biology education. Researchers will engage the public online using the citizen-science iNaturalist platform and will create bilingual (Spanish/English) blog posts about moss biology and polyploid evolution. <br/><br/>This project will expand our understanding of the consequences of autopolyploid evolution in plants. Researchers will use as an experimental model organism the moss species Physcomitrium pyriforme (Funariaceae, the Funaria moss family), which harbors a morphologically-diverse complex of seven karyotypes worldwide. The species is annual, bisexual, selfing, and is easily grown in the laboratory. Unlike most other plant model organisms, its genome content can be doubled with precision in vitro to create autopolyploid offspring. Researchers will compare reproductive barriers among naturally-occurring and artificially-induced autopolyploids as well as their homoploid progenitors. Project outcomes will include a phylogeny of the Physcomitrium pyriforme species-complex based on genome sequence data, an estimate of ploidy changes within the complex over evolutionary time and among populations today, and the description of new species. Researchers will further develop the HybPiper bioinformatics data analysis platform and train other US scientists in this method to enhance research capacity.

The initial application of this proposed project is an improved Lithium-ion battery separator comprising a nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film of 10-25-micron thickness with uniformly distributed interconnected 10-50 nm size cells. The nanoporous PEI separator, which has significantly higher heat resistance than current polyolefin-based separators, addresses a very urgent safety issue, i.e., batteries exploding and causing fire due to thermal instability of the separator. Moreover, compared to the current multi-step process for fabricating battery separators, this continuous process will have higher productivity thereby increasing the nation's global competitiveness in battery manufacturing. The total addressable global market for separators used in both primary (single-use) and secondary (rechargeable) lithium batteries is projected to be $1.65 billion by 2020 growing at 4.7%. This innovative research project will contribute to new knowledge in the areas of gas diffusion and cell nucleation in thermoplastic polymeric films and enable development, characterization and application of a whole new class of solid-state nanocellular polymer films.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project resides in the development of a manufacturing process that brings together interdisciplinary knowledge to synthesize and characterize nanostructures under various process conditions. This new knowledge will advance the field of nanomanufacturing and will be used to optimize processes towards commercialization targets. There are two technical challenges: (i) the dynamic seal concept, which has been proven in a 250-micron thick polymer film but not for a film 10-20 times lower in thickness; and (ii) maintaining enough gas concentration during the cell nucleation and growth to create nano-sized cells. The goals of this project are to: (a) establish the feasibility of a roll-to-roll process operating at a minimum speed of 1 meter/minute to produce nanocellular thermoplastic films and (b) develop a 100-mm wide, 10-25 micron thick nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film having the desired properties and nanostructure profile for a Li-ion battery separator application. These two goals will be achieved by implementing the dynamic seal technology to process a 100-mm wide film on a continuous basis and immediately heating the film to create nanocells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new hydrological regime is result of an increase in annual precipitation, a higher proportion of which is in the form of rain rather than snow, especially in the transition seasons of fall and spring. Under this collaborative project, the team will study annually laminated sediments in lakes of western Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic) to identify the sedimentary signal of recent changes in hydrology and use this to reconstruct the long-term history of rainfall-related sedimentary events to determine when similar conditions may have prevailed in the past. This project will involve a postdoctoral scientist, a graduate student, and undergraduate students at University of Massachusetts and Bates College, as well as teacher in the research.

For a long time, most of materials studied by Solid State Physics consisted either of periodic arrays of atoms or were amorphous (glasses). However, in the last decades a new class of solid state matter, called aperiodic crystals (or quasicrystals), has been found. An aperiodic crystal is a long range ordered structure, but without strict lattice periodicity. It is found in a wide range of materials: organic and inorganic compounds, minerals, metallic alloys and even some proteins. So far, quasicrystals found applications in the design of surgical instruments, LED lights, etc., and the list is growing. For the periodic and almost periodic materials, the goal of the project is to contribute to the fundamental problem in Solid State Physics of explaining the connections between micro (quantum mechanical) structures of solids and their macro properties. The third line of research in this project is aimed at a theoretical study of behavior of BEC (that was first predicted theoretically by Bose and Einstein in 1924, but was not produced experimentally until 1995). While quantum phenomena are exhibited on very small micro-scales, and on large macro-scales nature is well described by classical, Newtonian mechanics, for a BEC macroscopic quantum phenomena become apparent. There is a long list of potential applications of BEC, including quantum information and quantum computer. Several graduate students will be involved in this research.<br/><br/>In the area of rigorous study of topics in quasi-periodic Schroedinger operators in dimension 2 and higher, the goals of the project include proof of existence of extended quantum states at high energies, investigation of quantum transport associated with such operators, and also analysis of properties of solutions to the stationary Gross-Pitaevskii equation at high energies.

Professor Ingrid Fritsch of the University of Arkansas is developing a fast and versatile approach for screening components of crude synthetic mixtures of biologically-relevant chemicals in ultrasmall volumes. This new approach to chemical separations does not require high pressures nor high voltages. It also minimizes expense and improves portability. To meet these separation challenges, magnets and electricity are used to propel the fluid mixtures in the separation system. The system is essentially an indefinitely extended loop where analytes are separated. Each component is removed in a programmable fashion as it pulls away from the others so that separation conditions can be optimized for the rest. This approach advances opportunities for and has economic bearing on drug design, such as in peptide therapeutics, and other chemical products of interest for medical, pharmaceutical, and environmental uses. In an outreach partnership with High School teachers, a self-sustaining summer science workshop, developed by students, for students, focuses on concepts in the research project while highlighting the personalization and humanization of the science.<br/><br/>In this project, high-efficiency chemical separations at the small scale with the ability to program column length ""on-the-fly"" are being developed. Magnetoelectrochemical pumping in loop-based microfluidic channels, combined with ultrasensitive in situ detection of separations, determine conditions for the best separation efficiencies of mixtures focused on therapeutic peptides. Complementary fluorescence techniques are used, including total internal reflection, wide field imaging, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. An in-line sampling approach enables near real-time monitoring and tuning of separations. In addition, numerical simulations in three dimensions provide a better understanding of experimental results and suggest designs for improved efficiencies.

With shape morphing capabilities, robots can leverage varying shapes from the same structure for locomotion in different environments, which can drastically reduce the robot's costs while dramatically improving their performance. The approach can enable a structure to precisely morph into a three-dimensional shape without using bulky external sensors and actuators, making it suitable for various applications such as morphing wings, multimodal robots, programmable matter, foldable robots, etc. The project will also broadly impact STEM students of all ages through outreach to K-12 students, enhancement of existing curriculum with research-inspired projects, and promotion of undergraduate research.<br/><br/>The new shape morphing scheme is accomplished by embedding a novel twisted-and-coiled actuator (TCA) into soft materials, together with a thermoplastic material with temperature-dependent stiffness.  With the proposed scheme, this project aims to accomplish embedded and continuous shape morphing through closed-loop shape control enabled by the TCA's dual actuation and sensing capabilities. To do this, physics-based models will be first established to relate a desired shape of a structure to the embedded TCA's electrical resistance. Then, closed-loop shape control can be accomplished by controlling the TCA's resistance to a desired value. Finally, the proposed shape morphing scheme is applied to a miniature amphibious robot that can swim in water with straight legs and travel on ground by morphing the legs into a curved shape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In an amazing achievement, the genetic sequence of these enormous DNA molecules was decoded about twenty years ago.  Despite knowing the sequence, it remains unclear how these enormous molecules are packed into a cell nucleus (approximately a six micrometer diameter sphere) in a way that the genetic information can be useful. Understanding how the information in DNA is made available for use by the cell is fundamental for advances in modern medicine and to advancing health.  During one phase in the growth of cells, the molecules of the nucleus fill it in an uncondensed polymeric form that rapidly moves because of natural thermal agitation. The molecular motion is not fully understood, especially the coherent motions caused by the close packing in the nucleus where many parts of the  molecules move together. The goal of this research is to determine the mechanisms of this dynamic self-organization using a powerful combination of experiments, simulations and modeling.  By providing a microscopic description for the origin of coherent motions, the proposed research will transform our understanding of the mechanobiology of the nucleus.  This project also will provide novel educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, who will receive training in advanced imaging techniques and analysis, cellular biology, polymer dynamics, fluid mechanics, as well as mathematical and computational modeling.<br/> <br/>This collaborative project will combine high-resolution live cell imaging experiments with theoretical and computational models to probe and illuminate the microscopic origins of interphase chromatin dynamics and its effect on the spatiotemporal self-organization of DNA. To develop a close connection between experiments and models, we will perform experiments in several cell lines with different spatial distributions of chromatin. These experiments will provide exquisite measurements of correlated motions over a wide range of length and time scales, and will be used to decipher the contributions of internal active forces on chromatin organization. Moreover, these experiments will guide theoretical and computational models based on coarse-grained descriptions of the chromatin as a confined and hydrodynamically interacting flexible polymer chain driven internally by stochastic force dipoles representing active enzymes.

The discovery of proteorhodopsins in many diverse marine prokaryotic microbes has initiated extensive investigation into their distributions and functional roles.  Recently, a proton-pumping, rhodopsin-like gene was identified in diatoms, a group of marine phytoplankton that dominates the base of the food web in much of the Southern Ocean. Since this time, proteorhodopsins have been identified in many, but not all, diatom species.  The proteorhodopsin gene is more frequently found in diatoms residing in cold, iron-limited regions of the ocean, including the Southern Ocean, than in diatoms from other regions. It is thought that proteorhodopsin is especially suited for use energy production in the Southern Ocean since it uses no iron and its reaction rate is insensitive to temperature (unlike conventional photosynthesis). The overall objective of the project is to characterize Antarctic diatom-proteorhodopsin and determine its role in the adaptation of these diatoms to low iron concentrations and extremely low temperatures found in Antarctic waters. This research will provide new information on the genetic underpinnings that contribute to the success of diatoms in the Southern Ocean and how this unique molecule may play a pivotal role in providing energy to the base of the Antarctic food web.   Broader impact activities are aimed to promote the teaching and learning of polar marine-sciences related topics by translating research objectives into readily accessible educational materials for middle-school students.<br/><br/>This project will combine molecular, biochemical and physiological measurements to determine the role and importance of proteorhodopsin in diatom isolates from the Western Antarctic Peninsula region. Proton-pumping characteristics and pumping rates of proteorhodopsin as a function of light intensity and temperature, the resultant proteorhodopsin-linked intracellular ATP production rates, and the cellular localization of the protein will be determined. The project will examine the environmental conditions where Antarctic diatom-proteorhodopsin is most highly expressed and construct a cellular energy budget that includes diatom-proteorhodopsin when grown under these different environmental conditions.  Estimates of the energy flux generated by proteorhodopsin will be compared to total energy generation by the photosynthetic light reactions and metabolically coupled respiration rates. Finally, the characteristics and gene expression of diatom-proteorhodopsin in Antarctic diatoms and a proteorhodopsin-containing diatom isolates from temperate regions will be compared in order to determine if there is a preferential dependence on energy production through proteorhodopsin in diatoms residing in cold, iron-limited regions of the ocean. Educational activities will be performed in collaboration with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center who co-ordinates the SciVentures program, a popular summer camp for middle-school students from Chapel Hill and surrounding areas.  In collaboration with the Planetarium, the researchers will develop activities that focus on phytoplankton and the important role they play within polar marine food webs for the SciVentures participants. Additionally, a teaching module on Antarctic phytoplankton will be developed for classrooms and made available to educational networking websites and presented at workshops for science educators nationwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be achieved by developing a robust, efficient, small-scale power generator capable of converting on-site fuel to electricity. Beyond the entry opportunity in the oil & gas sector, this technology has other applications in large markets such as residential and commercial power generation and heating, transportation, and military. For example, our proposed generators would allow consumers in moderate/cold climates to efficiently match their time-dependent heating and electrical demands using natural gas (accessible to 70 million households). For a typical household in those regions, we estimate a 45% reduction in primary energy use and CO2 emissions by deploying our generators. The energy reduction translates to an annual savings of about $650 per household. Widespread deployment of our technology would grow the domestic natural gas economy, strengthen the US technological lead in semiconductor manufacturing, and facilitate renewables by providing a dispatchable supply.?<br/><br/>The proposed project will investigate the fundamental heat-to-electric conversion process and address key issues around the stability and robustness of the technology, through a synergistic effort to develop generators capable of high performance and a manufacturing process to reduce cost. The project will focus on device optimization and durability, and process repeatability. This involves the fabrication and integration of multiple frequency-selective components including a thermal emitter, optical filter, photovoltaic cell, and back surface reflector. Each component, as well as the integrated system, will undergo rigorous thermal testing to prove both resistance to elevated temperatures and temperature swings. Additionally, novel manufacturing techniques will be developed to enable cost-competitive devices relative to conventional generators.

New materials are expected to have a significant impact in a broad range of application domains, ranging from biomedical systems to infrastructure and energy systems, improving the efficiencies of these systems and creating new capabilities that have so far been technologically out of reach.  In current practice, however, the development of new materials is very costly and time-consuming because it relies mostly on physical testing and experimentation. Rather than focusing on the development of a specific new material, this award aims to develop modeling approaches and learning algorithms that allow for more efficient and effective exploration and discovery of new materials in general. The results of the investigation will help material scientists and engineers understand when to rely on mathematical analysis models or when to use physical experiments so that new information about so far unexplored materials can be gathered efficiently, and so that the materials design effort can be efficiently guided towards materials with desired and valuable properties. The research is expected to lead to a dramatic acceleration of the materials design process with significant competitive advantages to US industry. Through a university-industry consortium these innovations will be transferred into industrial practice.  All new models and algorithms will be shared open-source, and the research findings, methods and tools will be incorporated in on-campus and on-line courses, with the potential to reach a large number of students, researchers and practitioners.  <br/><br/>The main research objective of this project is to critically evaluate the relative merits of different modeling formalisms and approaches for capturing and utilizing materials domain knowledge in a way that is most valuable to the designer. In the design process, multiple information sources will be combined, including bulk material tests, low-cost experimental assays, and physics-based multiscale Process-Structure-Property models.  The hypothesis is that combining information from a portfolio of information sources with synergistic cost-accuracy trade-offs leads to a more efficient and effective design process. A second focus is on combining the information from these sources into integrative reduced-order Process-Structure-Property linkages.  These linkages support learning through Bayesian updating as new information is acquired, and they are computationally inexpensive and therefore well-suited for searching the design space.  The overall design framework will be applied and validated in the context of dual phase steels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cost of manufacturing is a serious issue for many of these drugs. One major cost is for the nutrients required by these microbes to grow and produce the drug. The goal of this project is to lower nutrient costs and overall production costs by growing two microbes together. One microbe is photosynthetic. It will utilize sunlight and carbon dioxide to generate nutrients that are then consumed by the other microbe. This removes the need to purchase expensive nutrients, decreasing the cost of drug manufacture. In this project, the target product will be endolysin, a novel treatment against chicken infections that can potentially avoid the widespread use of antibiotics in the poultry industry. The project will also educate students from the high school to the graduate level about co-cultures, preparing them for employment in the growing biomanufacturing industry.<br/><br/>Commercially, filamentous fungi like Aspergillus produce enzymes, antibiotics, and metabolites. Economic analysis reveals that the cost of organic carbon feedstocks is a major cost for these processes. In nature, filamentous fungi are found as part of lichens, which are a symbiosis between a photosynthetic autotroph (photobiont) and its partner, typically a fungus similar to Aspergillus.  The photobiont provides organic carbon, generated using carbon dioxide and sunlight, to partner fungal species. The fungi generate useful biochemicals.  The goal of this project is to implement synthetic lichen co-cultures as a transformative biomanufacturing platform for the production of a novel antimicrobial peptide. Cultivation conditions that allow Aspergillus and cyanobacteria to grow successfully together will be identified. Interactions between the two partners will be characterized using genome scale co-culture models that incorporate transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolic data. This model will be used to determine the media composition and cultivation regime that optimizes the growth and production capabilities of our synthetic lichen.  The synthetic lichen will then generate a novel anti-microbial peptide, endolysin, which could replace antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections in chickens. Overall, the project will develop a low-cost platform for the production of a wide variety of therapeutic molecules and proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project seeks to understand how small forces applied to the hand can be used to alter clinically-relevant human gait patterns.  The project is significant because it generates the experimental data and models of human gait and sensorimotor cognition needed to develop a robotic device that will interact physically and intuitively with individuals with mobility impairments to enhance their quality of life.  By developing a robotic test-bed system and the models of human sensorimotor behavior that will guide its actions, this project will serve the national interest and advance the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health.  <br/><br/>The project takes a three-stage approach to advancing the objectives of the NSF's Mind, Machine and Motor Nexus (M3X) program, which are to understand how the human mind controls body movements during the manipulation of machines, and how machine response can shape and influence both the mindset and movements of the human user. First, the project team will use novel instrumented devices and motion capture technology to measure interactive human-to-human hand forces and the resulting gait motions that occur during the proposed therapeutic intervention. In Stage 2 they will use machine learning techniques to develop a model of the motor and cognitive transformations that occurred during the human-to-human experiments of Stage 1. Finally, the team will embed the models within a novel robotic test-bed that will implement physical human-robot interactions at the hands. Human-robot experiments will evaluate the ability of the test-bed to promote desired changes in clinically-relevant gait characteristics such as gait speed, step length and step cadence.  Fundamental issues addressed by the project include: 1) identifying the relationships between hand forces, gait dynamics and perceived intents of the instructor (therapist) and student (patient) that arise during a simplified version of rehabilitative partner dance; 2) modeling those relationships so as to enable prediction of how small hand forces indirectly change human gait dynamics; and 3) developing a robotic gait coach capable of promoting desired changes in human gait dynamics.  In addition, the project supports education and promotes diversity through innovative outreach activities that will engage teams of students and older adults from underrepresented communities in the conception, design and prototyping of mobility-related assistive technologies. The project outcomes may have long-term impact on the quality of life of millions of Americans with deficits of gait by developing a robotic system that can assist therapists in their efforts to improve patient fitness, mobility, and independence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the five years of this project, Quincy University (QU) will award scholarships of up to $6,000 per year to 20 eligible students, renewable through their senior year. QU is in southwestern Illinois, in the largest town in a 100-mile radius.  Forty percent of its students are from surrounding rural communities. Thus, the grantee institution provides an important setting to study the pathways of rural low-income students pursuing STEM education. These students often do not pursue STEM majors because they lack exposure to and experience with diverse STEM career options. This program aims to improve degree attainment, and to equip students with transferable skills that employers seek. Such skills include critical thinking, oral and written communication, and leadership. By increasing access to high-quality STEM education and providing individualized, methodical, and intensive professional guidance, this project expects to increase opportunities for members of a large sector of society that has a prominent presence in the region. Moreover, the project will generate knowledge on how to recruit, retain, and successfully graduate rural, low-income, high-achieving students in STEM fields. <br/><br/>This project has three goals. First, it aims to increase opportunities and access to higher education for academically high-achieving, financially disadvantaged students pursuing non-clinical biology and chemistry degrees. Second, it aims to enhance the broad understanding of evidence-based academic and student support activities needed to increase the interest of these students in pursuing STEM degrees. Third, QU plans to increase the first-year retention rate and four-year graduation rate for the scholarship recipients. QU's recruitment plan builds on relationships already in place at surrounding rural high schools, and includes faculty outreach and an on-campus STEM Career Fair. Students receiving scholarships will be partnered with a success coach and faculty mentor, and placed into a learning community. Scholarship recipients will: be housed together in the residence hall; co-enroll in major and general education courses throughout their academic tenure; and participate in programming to support academic success and social integration, such as field trips to local industries or university research facilities, and service activities. A new, required sophomore-level ""Introduction to Research"" course will give the students the opportunity to participate in laboratory or field research with a faculty mentor.  The project will make use of quantitative and qualitative data, including student records, surveys, and student products such as guided reflections and coursework to determine the effect of project activities on retention, graduation, and learning outcomes for supported students.  Evaluation tools will include Articulated Learning Guided Reflections, the Inquiry and Analysis VALUE rubric from the American Association of Colleges & Universities, the Themed Learning Community Questionnaire, Social Cognitive Career Theory, and the National Survey of Student Engagement. A control cohort will be established by matching demographic and academic characteristics of students who were not scholarship recipients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This subject has seen major developments in the last few years. One of the most striking is the invention of modern invariants counting the number of curves with certain properties in spaces that are expected to be related to our current universe's space-time. A major breakthrough came from understanding that the computation of some of these invariants can be understood in terms of solutions of certain equations related to the geometry of so-called mirror spaces. While the initial description of these invariants was geometric in nature, work of Kontsevich and Costello suggests that an algebraic approach would lead to increased flexibility and more efficient computation. The goal of this project is to expand that work and define the invariants in such a way that existing results on the Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture will automatically imply that existing numerical predictions on curve-counts are correct.  <br/><br/><br/>Kevin Costello introduced in 2005 a categorical generalization of Gromov-Witten invariants, defined for all genera. Despite considerable interest, very little is known about these invariants. The first calculation of them, for the universal family of elliptic curves, was achieved by the PI in 2017, in joint work with Junwu Tu. In this project the PI expand the current understanding of these invariants. The PI will complete ideas originally proposed  by K. Costello, and then use the resulting theory to compute B-model Gromov-Witten invariants of positive genus for higher dimensional varieties, including the quintic threefold.  This will verify the validity of the mirror symmetry predictions in higher genus. The main approach will be to replace the geometric spaces with algebraic structures called categories of matrix factorizations. This is of independent interest in itself: the invariants of these categories should be closely related to the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariants, but such a relationship is not explicitly known.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the one hand, many biologists maintain that the flexibility to change appearance, behavior or physiology are of no relevance to evolution, because evolution requires genetic change. On the other hand, a growing number of researchers have suggested that such flexibility plays a critical role in evolution by jump-starting genetic change. This research will help resolve this controversy by investigating whether changes in appearance, behavior and/or physiology precede (and enable) the evolutionary origins of major, new, genetically-encoded features. The research will specifically evaluate whether pre-existing, diet-induced flexibility has contributed to the evolution of a novel, complex body form in spadefoot frogs. Thus, not only will this research provide important insights into the evolutionary process, it will also shed new light onto one of biology's enduring mysteries: how complex features originate. The research will also promote educational outreach by training school children and undergraduate students and by organizing public talks at museums.<br/><br/>This research will test the Plasticity-First hypothesis of adaptive evolution. To do so, the proposed research will focus on spadefoot toads. Like most frogs, tadpoles in the genus Scaphiopus develop only into a typical 'omnivore' morph. By contrast, tadpoles in the genus Spea exhibit striking plasticity: depending on their diet, they develop into either omnivores or a novel 'carnivore' morph. Interestingly, certain components of this distinctive carnivore morph can be diet-induced in Scaphiopus. Moreover, some Spea populations have secondarily lost the omnivore-carnivore plasticity and become monomorphic. Indeed, in some populations, selection has favored the near fixation of the carnivore morph. Thus, as a group, spadefoots appear to represent different stages in the evolution of the novel carnivore morph: from its possible initial induction (in Scaphiopus), to its refinement as part of a novel developmental 'switch' (in many Spea populations), to its ultimate fixation (in some Spea populations). The planned research will evaluate whether this novel carnivore phenotype arose through plasticity-first evolution by contrasting development, genetic variation, and performance in different species/populations that serve as different evolutionary stages in the origins of this distinctive form. In doing so, the research will evaluate the critical predictions of the plasticity-first hypothesis. This research will thereby help to clarify plasticity's role in evolutionary innovation and provide a roadmap for others to test the plasticity-first hypothesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many questions remain about how organic matter is removed from freshwaters.  A key challenge is that not all organic matter is the same.  Organic matter dissolved in freshwaters is made up of many different compounds. These compounds range in age, source, and chemical composition, all of which can influence how fast they are processed.  To overcome this challenge, researchers will collect real-time sensor data and design field-scale experiments to measure how fast organic matter is removed by streams. The project aims to test hypotheses about what processes control the removal of different types of organic matter from streams and rivers.  This is important because organic matter provides energy that supports food webs, and can pollute downstream ecosystems. Organic matter processing can also determine rates of greenhouse emissions from streams and rivers to the atmosphere. This research will also provide valuable opportunities for high school teachers to engage in investigations that will enhance their ability to meet Next-Generation Science standards.<br/><br/>What processes drive organic carbon removal in streams, and how does organic carbon removal regulate the degree to which running waters are biological reactors versus exporters of organic carbon?  These are key unresolved questions in carbon cycle research.  This project will develop a proof-of-concept approach to test the hypothesis that non-additive effects of mixed organic matter sources (i.e. priming) control organic carbon removal in streams.  Data products will include estimates of organic carbon turnover distance derived from ecosystem metabolism and stream chemistry, as well as empirical measures of organic carbon removal from ecosystem-level experiments that use single-source and mixed organic carbon additions.  Project data and computer source codes will be shared openly via HydroShare and GitHub, respectively.  The research will be conducted at Flathead Lake Biological Station and the researchers will partner with the Station?s recently funded SensorSpace, a community facility for construction and testing of novel environmental sensors, as well as a test bed for integrating sensor-based data into Next-Generation Science curricula.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The shortages are most severe in high-poverty urban districts and many of these districts are forced to employ teachers who are less qualified to teach STEM classes.  In response to the STEM teacher shortage in Dallas-Fort Worth (urban) school districts, this Track 1 Noyce project at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) seeks to address this need for high quality teachers by recruiting, preparing, inducting, and retaining teachers for secondary science, mathematics, and computer science to teach in high need schools.   Specific project objectives are to: 1) recruit mathematics, science, and computer science  teacher candidates from students at community colleges and baccalaureate programs, and career changers from local industry; 2) provide a quality teacher certification program for candidates with significant faculty mentoring, support, and professional development experiences integrated throughout the program; and 3) support and promote teacher induction and retention in the teaching profession, implementing various levels of guidance from professional educators, school-based Mentor Teachers, and Near-Peer Mentors. <br/><br/>This Noyce project builds upon previous successful UTA Noyce projects in partnership with the Dallas, Arlington, and Ft. Worth Independent School Districts.  The Tarrant County College is a community college partner that can assist in expanding the pipeline of new secondary science, mathematics, and computer science teachers.   One new aspect of this effort is the recruitment of computer science majors to the teaching profession.  This Noyce project seeks to provide scholarships to 50 STEM majors to prepare and certify them as highly qualified teachers in the shortage areas of science, mathematics, and computer science.   The project intends to provide summer internships to 40 STEM first year and sophomore students as a strategy for recruiting teacher candidates.   The project aims to give at least 33% of the scholarships to community college transfer students.  Eligible first- and second-year transfer students will have priority for summer internships.  Undergraduate and post-baccalaureate students will be given scholarships and pathways to earn teacher certification through UTA's nationally accredited UTeach Arlington program.  Additional project features and supports for Noyce Scholars include UTA faculty mentors; school-based Mentor Teachers throughout early field experiences, student teaching, and induction into the profession; a Near-Peer mentoring program; and Scholar Learning Seminars and conference participation as continuous professional development.  The UTA program's Noyce Scholar Leader (an experienced retired teacher) will provide sustained guidance through visits and support induction of new Noyce teachers into the profession.  This Noyce project includes an ongoing research component that aims to measure Noyce Scholars' learning and transition into teaching, including shifts in self-efficacy toward teaching, primary teaching practices, and views of the nature of mathematics and science disciplines.  The project also intends collect information on best practices in the recruitment, preparation, induction, and retention of new STEM teachers.  Results of this research will be presented at professional conferences and published in scholarly journals.  The primary benefit of this Noyce project will be the new science, mathematics, and computer science teachers produced who will serve in schools where they are most needed.  Other institutions of higher educations may also benefit from the results from the project's research effort and project evaluation, which may provide valuable information on best practices for preparing teachers for high need schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are developing a theory and computational methods to enable calculating the rate of energy transfer processes. Energy transfer processes play a very significant role in telecommunications, in solar energy utilization, in photosynthesis, and in electronic devices where energy is transmitted from one molecule to another through the emission and then absorption of light.    The theory that Schatz and coworkers are developing is important for engineering applications in the design of new devices.  It provides a framework for organizing components so that energy transfer between emitters and absorbers is selectively optimized.  In addition, the project enables an understanding of energy transfer involving quantum light (i.e., light with intrinsically quantum properties).  The research activities are used in the training of graduates, undergraduates and postdocs.  They are also used in the development of software tools that are made publicly available.  In addition, there are several outreach activities that use material related to the research.<br/><br/><br/>This program of research describes the development of new theories and computational methods for determining the rates of donor-acceptor energy transfer and related radiative processes associated with emitters and absorbers that are in the presence of complex dispersive optical structures, including semiconductor, dielectric and metallic nanoparticles, surfaces, and other photonic or plasmonic structures. There are a growing number of experiments where the complex optical environment plays an important role in energy transfer, sometimes enhancing energy transfer rates by many orders of magnitude and extending the range of energy transfer beyond the point where electrostatic interactions are adequate.  In this situation, traditional F?rster theory and standard improvements thereto are inadequate.  Recently the Schatz group has developed a new approach to these problems, one that is fully quantum electrodynamic in nature but which only involves classical electrodynamics calculations for the optical response, making it possible to use existing computational electrodynamics methods with relatively simple modifications to calculate energy transfer rates.  In addition, the method can be evaluated in the time domain, which is important in the treatment of complex structures, and allowing for the study of nonstationary donor and acceptor states where coherences and entangled states are excited.  The proposal describes the development of theory that builds on this recent work, including (1) the proper incorporation of competing radiative and nonradiative processes in energy transfer, (2) the inclusion of donors and acceptors that are too large for point dipole approximations, (3) the treatment of dielectric response in the optical medium that goes beyond the standard Drude/Lorentz dielectric models, and (4) the description of energy transfer processes associated with coherent superpositions of quantum states, including entangled states.  The proposal describes a number of applications of the theory to recent and planned experiments, by collaborators and others, involving donor/acceptor energy transfer in the presence of particles and interfaces, including applications that test all the proposed new elements of the theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New data sets and new methodologies offer valuable insights, yet many of the fundamental processes in the Earth's interior are still poorly understood. Part of the impediment to progress is the disciplinary nature of research conducted so far. A more integrated approach that leverages the knowledge and latest achievements in each of the relevant disciplines is needed to generate new ideas and to identify new observations that distinguish between competing hypotheses. <br/><br/>This award will support a training program for the Cooperative Institute for Dynamic Earth Research (CIDER) on the theme of relating geochemical and geophysical heterogeneity in the Earth's interior. The six-week summer program will bring together a cohort of senior graduate students and postdocs from institutions across the country to tackle important and unsolved research problems in Earth Sciences research. The senior participants are experts from different disciplines relevant to the theme and serve as instructors and mentors for group research projects. CIDER addresses the barriers to more integrated research by promoting cross-disciplinary education for researchers at all career levels. The central aim of the program is to develop a workforce that can more effectively engage in interdisciplinary research and accelerate progress on unsolved problems of long-standing interest.<br/><br/>CIDER summer activities will address two issues of great societal relevance. One issue deals with natural hazards such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. A better understanding of these hazards will be linked to the broader context of the Earth's overall dynamics. The second issue deals with the Earth's budget and cycling of volatile elements, particularly water and carbon dioxide. The long-term stability of climate on our planet is regulated by these processes. CIDER contributes to the following broader impacts: (1) it facilitates the cross-disciplinary education of earth scientists at all career levels; (2) it aims to educate a new generation of Earth scientists with a breadth of competence across disciplines, which is crucial for solving many of the important and outstanding research questions. CIDER's web resources include posting and webcasting of lectures given during the summer programs, as well as planned web forums and open publications. The site is designed to reach the entire community of earth scientists.

Massive ice shelves buttress marine terminating glaciers, slowing the rate that land ice reaches the sea and, in turn, restraining the rate of sea level rise. To date, most work has focused on the destabilizing impacts of warmer air and water temperatures, resulting in melting that thins and weakens ice shelves. However, recent findings indicate that sea ice does not protect ice shelves from wave impacts as much as previously thought, which has raised the possibility that tsunamis and other ocean waves could affect shelf stability. This project will assess the potential for increased shelf fracturing from the impact of tsunamis and from heightened wave activity due to climate-driven changes in storm patterns and reduced sea-ice extent by developing models to investigate how wave impacts damage ice shelves. The modeling effort will allow for regional comparisons between large and small ice shelves, and provide an evaluation of the impacts of changing climate and storm patterns on ice shelves, ice sheets, glaciers, and, ultimately, sea level rise. This project will train graduate students in mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary approaches to Earth and ocean sciences.<br/><br/>This project takes a four-pronged approach to estimating the impact of vibrations on ice shelves at the grounding zone due to tsunamis, very long period, infragravity, and storm-driven waves. First, the team will use high-resolution tsunami modeling to investigate the response of ice shelves along the West Antarctic coast to waves originating in different regions of the Pacific Ocean. Second, it will compare the response to wave impacts on grounding zones of narrow and wide ice shelves. Third, it will assess the exposure risk due to storm forcing through a reanalysis of weather and wave model data; and, finally, the team will model the propagation of ocean-wave-induced vibrations in the ice from the shelf front to and across the grounding zone. In combination, this project aims to identify locations along the Antarctic coast that are subject to enhanced, bathymetrically-focused, long-period ocean-wave impacts. Linkages between wave impacts and climate arise from potential changes in sea-ice extent in front of shelves, and changes in the magnitude, frequency, and tracks of storms. Understanding the effects of ocean waves and climate on ice-shelf integrity is critical to anticipate their contribution to the amplitude and timing of sea-level rise. Wave-driven reductions in ice-shelf stability may enhance shelf fragmentation and iceberg calving, reducing ice shelf buttressing and eventually accelerating sea-level rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This enzyme speeds up the production of deoxyribonucleotides, which are building blocks of DNA, and thus plays a pivotal role in cell division. The deoxyribonucleotides are formed from ribonucleotides by a process that involves transfer of negatively-charged electrons over a long distance.  The transfer of the electrons is coordinated with the transfer of positively-charged protons.  Professor Barry studies how protein motions or dynamics facilitate and control these proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions in RNR.  The intellectual merit of this project lies in the generation of fundamental chemical insights into PCET reactions, which are ubiquitous in biology. Professor Barry participates in a joint teaching and research effort in collaboration with Professor Lisa Hibbard at Spelman College, an Historically Black College or University (HBCU) for women. In addition, Dr. Barry is initiating a collaboration with the Center for the Visually Impaired in Atlanta to begin STEM tutoring of high school and middle school students with vision impairments. This effort serves as the basis for innovation in the freshman chemistry curriculum at Georgia Tech. The goal is to further and more broadly enhance the participation of visually impaired individuals in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This research project compares different members of the Class 1a RNR enzymes isolated from bacteria and human cells, with the goal of defining conserved PCET mechanism(s).  Enzymes from this class are composed of two types of subunits, alpha and beta.  They employ a tyrosyl radical (YO.)-diferric cofactor situated in the beta subunit as a radical initiator for substrate reduction in the alpha subunit.  This process occurs through reversible PCET over a conserved pathway of tyrosine residues situated in the alpha and beta subunits.  Remarkably, the radical transfer pathway spans 35 angstroms.  Professor Barry tests the hypothesis that radical transfer across the alpha/beta interface changes the conformation of the YO. radical initiator, alters hydrogen bonding to YO. and the diferric cluster, and changes the conformation and hydrogen bonding of other tyrosines on the PCET pathway.  Two techniques, namely reaction-induced FT-IR (RIFT-IR) and UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy,, are employed. The UVRR and RIFT-IR spectra are assigned by isotopic labeling, solvent isotope exchange, site-directed mutagenesis, and site-specific mutagenesis using unnatural amino acids.  Spectral results are interpreted by comparison to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on tyrosine-containing peptides and on models of the tyrosyl radical-differic cluster.  Molecular dynamics simulations of the subunit in the tyrosyl radical and tyrosine singlet states are also used to simulate redox-linked conformational changes. This project advances the fundamental understanding of enzyme mechanism and aids in the development of biomimetic strategies for energy conversion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most state-of-the-art synthesis tools do not model nor analyze resource usage.

Such structured, high-dimensional data arise naturally in bioinformatics, signal processing, quantum mechanics and networks.  Handling this massive high-dimensional data is impossible unless the underlying parameter of interest has additional structure.  Examples of additional structure that arise in applications include sparsity or low-rankness and powerful estimation methods have been developed in the last decade to successfully recover the true parameter whenever such additional structure is present in the data. However, identifying whether such additional structure is present in the data is more challenging than the corresponding estimation problem. New phase transitions are seen and novel methods are needed. The goal of the current project is to develop statistical methodology aimed at identifying the existence of such additional structure, and to study the theoretical phase transitions of the problem.<br/><br/><br/>The high-dimensional setting considers the situation where the number of unknown parameters outnumber the number of samples. Estimation procedures have successfully solves this high-dimensional setting under additional structural assumption on the problem: Common structural assumptions include sparsity or low-rankness, where the unknown parameter possesses some low-dimensional property.  In the so called sparse or low-rank regime, consistent estimation of the unknown parameter becomes possible even in the high-dimensional ""large p small n"" settings.  The proposed research will focus on uncertainty quantification in such structured, high-dimensional settings. Methodologies will be developed to construct confidence sets and confidence bands tailored to structured high-dimensional problems. A major challenge that will be studied both theoretically and empirically is identifying whether the sparse or low-rank regime actually occurs, or equivalently the construction of adaptive confidence sets. An adaptive confidence set captures the true parameter with high probability, and its size shrinks optimally with respect to the unknown sparsity or low-rankness of the problem.  The optimality properties of adaptive confidence sets will be studied, as well as the corresponding phase transitions with respect to the problem parameters.  The proposed research is motivated by and will be directly applicable to scientific fields where high-dimensional data arise.  An adaptive confidence set has major applications in practice as it provides a certificate that the sparse or low-rank regime actually occurs, and such certificate asserts that the high-dimensional estimation and inferential methods used in practice are actually accurate. Identifying whether the sparse regime actually occurs has direct applications in bioinformatics and signal processing, while identifying whether the low-rank regime occurs has direct applications in quantum tomography and matrix completion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New materials are expected to have a significant impact in a broad range of application domains, ranging from biomedical systems to infrastructure and energy systems, improving the efficiencies of these systems and creating new capabilities that have so far been technologically out of reach.  In current practice, however, the development of new materials is very costly and time-consuming because it relies mostly on physical testing and experimentation. Rather than focusing on the development of a specific new material, this award aims to develop modeling approaches and learning algorithms that allow for more efficient and effective exploration and discovery of new materials in general. The results of the investigation will help material scientists and engineers understand when to rely on mathematical analysis models or when to use physical experiments so that new information about so far unexplored materials can be gathered efficiently, and so that the materials design effort can be efficiently guided towards materials with desired and valuable properties. The research is expected to lead to a dramatic acceleration of the materials design process with significant competitive advantages to US industry. Through a university-industry consortium these innovations will be transferred into industrial practice.  All new models and algorithms will be shared open-source, and the research findings, methods and tools will be incorporated in on-campus and on-line courses, with the potential to reach a large number of students, researchers and practitioners.  <br/><br/>The main research objective of this project is to critically evaluate the relative merits of different modeling formalisms and approaches for capturing and utilizing materials domain knowledge in a way that is most valuable to the designer. In the design process, multiple information sources will be combined, including bulk material tests, low-cost experimental assays, and physics-based multiscale Process-Structure-Property models.  The hypothesis is that combining information from a portfolio of information sources with synergistic cost-accuracy trade-offs leads to a more efficient and effective design process. A second focus is on combining the information from these sources into integrative reduced-order Process-Structure-Property linkages.  These linkages support learning through Bayesian updating as new information is acquired, and they are computationally inexpensive and therefore well-suited for searching the design space.

More accurate projections of future climate scenarios will require a more detailed understanding of how fast natural processes can remove from Earth's atmosphere the pulse of carbon dioxide that is being produced by society in the industrial era. Models of these processes predict a long tail of the pulse of human-produced carbon dioxide, suggesting that this carbon will have a long-term impact on our climate and society.  As these processes play out over relatively long timescales, such predictions can be verified by looking to the geological record of past events. This project will provide a high-resolution reconstruction of how an ancient natural pulse of carbon dioxide injected into the atmosphere was neutralized by the Earth system in the geological past. As such, this study will provide important perspective from the past on the present rate at which atmospheric carbon can be taken up by natural processes, and hence help Earth scientists make more accurate projections of future climate change.  The researchers will also work with a Geoscience summer residence camp for high school students and non-science major undergraduate students will participate in experiential learning in the field on the impact of climate change. Both activities will contribute to bringing students with diverse backgrounds into STEM and geoscience career paths.<br/>This research will evaluate the evolution of atmospheric CO2 on decadal timescales following a rapid pulse of large amounts of carbon dioxide injected into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions that was part of the Columbia River Basalt Group in the US Pacific Northwest.  At the same time as these eruptions and nearby in northern Idaho, an ancient lake (Miocene Lake Clarkia) was formed when basalt flows presumably dammed a local drainage system.  Sediments that began to accumulate in the newly formed Lake Clarkia preserve a history of these events in the geological record that can be used to evaluate, in high-resolution, the evolution of the spike of atmospheric CO2 concentrations that resulted from the volcanic eruptions.  The researchers will use micro-XRF scanning of elemental distributions to focus their study on the unoxidized, varve-like sediments.  They will reconstruct the evolution of this natural pulse of CO2 using the properties of stomatal pores in fossil leaves preserved in the sediments, combined with information from the stable isotopes of carbon preserved in the fossil organic matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are two main ways that ocean waves can generate microseism energy: 1) the interaction between waves traveling in different directions in the open ocean (secondary microseisms), and 2) the interaction of waves with the seafloor in shallow areas near the coast (primary microseisms). We presently have a good understanding of secondary microseisms, but the generation and propagation of primary microseisms is not well understood.  Recently, it has been discovered that several large lakes around the world also produce microseism energy, including Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone Lake provides a unique opportunity to study microseisms because, unlike the large oceans, it is relatively small and can be completely surrounded by seismic instruments, which gives us the opportunity to pinpoint the locations where microseisms are being generated and to study how they propagate into the surrounding regions. Our project will take advantage of the ongoing HD-YLAKE project, which deployed an array of seismometers on the floor of Yellowstone Lake, by supplementing those instruments with arrays of seismometers on the lake's perimeter and islands. In addition, we will also deploy instruments to simultaneously measure key atmospheric information (air temperature, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction) and the lake waves (amplitude, period, and direction) while the seismometers are recording. This combination of atmospheric, wave, and seismic data has never been collected in one place before, and it will provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand the processes that generate microseisms. Our results will have broad implications for the study of microseisms, and ultimately, we want to develop the ability to use these naturally occurring seismic waves to image the Earth's structure. This is an exciting possibility in Yellowstone Lake, because it hosts active hydrothermal systems that are believed to create large gas pockets in the lake floor sediments, and the microseism propagation velocity should be very sensitive to the presence of gas. As a broader impact, the investigators will work with Yellowstone Park educators to make their results accessible to the wider public through their exhibits.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:  It has recently been found that many lakes generate observable microseisms at periods near 1 s.  Observations from land-based seismometers deployed near lakes show that the microseisms propagate as short-period Rayleigh waves (Rg), often with prograde particle motion because of the low velocity of lake sediments. However, it is unknown if the source process is linear, corresponding to primary ocean microseisms, or non-linear, corresponding to secondary ocean microseisms, or both. It is also unknown whether the source regions are predominantly in the open water or near the shoreline, and how the microseismic wavefield evolves as it crosses the shoreline. Yellowstone Lake is an excellent natural laboratory for understanding shallow water microseisms because (1) there are no potentially confounding swells from distant storms, as there are in the oceans, (2) the source region is geographically small and can essentially be surrounded with seismometers, and (3) the Yellowstone Lake microseisms are a regular, repeatable phenomenon associated with diurnal wind variation during the summer and fall. An understanding of the source mechanism of Yellowstone Lake microseisms will likely be applicable to other shallow water regions around the world and could lead to improved imaging of very shallow Earth structure. The proposed work involves a monthlong deployment of (1) 40 three-component, autonomous, 5-Hz geophones around the perimeter of Yellowstone Lake and on islands within the lake, (2) four weather stations collocated with selected geophones, and (3) two wave-height recorders in the northern portion of the Yellowstone Lake. The deployment is planned for the summer of 2018 so that it can overlap with the ongoing, NSF-funded, HDYLAKE experiment, which deployed an array of 10 lake-bottom seismometers around an active hydrothermal site. The PIs and a graduate student will analyze the interdisciplinary data set in an effort to determine the origin and generation mechanism of the short-period (~1 sec) microseisms that were recently observed to originate from Yellowstone Lake during periods of open water.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our ability to make accurate predictions of turbulent flows is important in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines, including atmospheric flows, aerospace, naval, automotive, wind and nuclear energy, etc. In all these fields, we rely on supercomputers to 'simulate' turbulence in order to predict tomorrow's weather, the lift and drag of a future airplane design, and so on. These types of turbulence simulations solve a set of mathematical equations on a grid of smaller cells. In the vast majority of applications, these cells are anisotropic, i.e., they have different lengths in different directions. In contrast, the vast majority of the underlying mathematical and physical theory upon which these turbulence simulations are based was developed for the assumption of isotropic (i.e., perfectly cubic) cells. This project is aimed at reconciling this gap, which is expected to lead to more accurate and trustworthy turbulence simulations across the wide range of disciplines in which they are used.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop models for turbulence-resolving simulations (mainly, large eddy simulations) that behave consistently and accurately on anisotropic grids. Consistency is defined here as having the right behavior in the limits of increasing anisotropies, while accuracy is defined as making effective and efficient use of the given grid resolution. Models of both eddy-viscosity and tensorial forms will be considered. A key component of the project is to perform a comprehensive and conclusive assessment of how different grid anisotropies affect the accuracy, and to communicate this to developers and practitioners in the field. This should raise awareness and hopefully stimulate further work throughout the field, beyond the planned model developments in the present project. The assessment will be performed on multiple canonical flows, including channel flow, a temporally developing mixing layer, and a transitional boundary layer. Crucially, the assessment will be performed using three different numerical codes, to ensure the robustness of the findings and avoid code-specific conclusions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most basic electron and proton transfer reactions relevant to energy storage in chemical bonds are those involved in the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen. Man-made catalysts are not very efficient at accelerating this process, despite its relative simplicity. In contrast, living systems have evolved a class of enzymes called the hydrogenases that catalyze the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen at extraordinary rates and with little energy loss. The hydrogenases serve as ideal models for understanding the basic principles of efficient catalysis of multi-electron, multi-proton chemistry, which is important for a wide range of applications including generation of solar fuels. While the structures of hydrogenases are well established, their mechanisms remain poorly understood; indeed, although the chemical structures of the active site of the enzymes have been exactly reproduced in synthetic mimics, these mimics fail as catalysts, highlighting the importance of the protein architecture that surrounds the active site. The Dyer group uses unique laser-based methods to elucidate the dynamics and mechanisms of the electron and proton transfer processes and the role of the protein in controlling them.  This research helps students at all levels develop highly interdisciplinary skills and a knowledge base focused on renewable energy science. Training students in renewable energy science is accomplished through the Emory Chemistry Intern Program (high school students) and the Emory SURE and SIRE programs (undergraduates) with an emphasis on underrepresented minority students recruited from the Historically Black Atlanta University Center.  Professor Dyer's laboratory has a strong record of dissemination of cutting edge chemical techniques such as the laser induced T-jump methods now widely used in protein folding.<br/><br/>Hydrogenases exemplify the challenges inherent to mechanistic studies of the highly efficient oxidoreductases. These challenges are both practical, due to the difficulty of resolving the molecular processes for enzymes with kcat > 1,000 s-1, and conceptual, due to the complexity of the structures and dynamics that orchestrate the electron and proton transfer reactions. Because of the extraordinarily fast catalytic rates of these enzymes, their mechanisms have been difficult to study directly. The Dyer lab recently developed an approach that enables the study of the elementary electron and proton transfer steps during fast enzyme turnover.  The approach combines a laser-induced redox potential jump with time-resolved infrared spectroscopy studies of the enzyme active site. Using this unique approach, they investigate critical mechanistic questions for the hydrogenases, including how these enzymes move electrons and protons together to avoid high barrier traps (testing the principle of electroneutrality), what are the proton pathways and how are proton transfer and electron transfer gated, and what are the mechanisms of the reaction of molecular oxygen with the active site, enzyme inactivation, and reductive reactivation. Professor Dyer creates unique research opportunities to broadly train high school, undergraduate and graduate students in this research, and to help them develop highly interdisciplinary skills and gain a knowledge base focused on renewable energy science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to experimentally investigate optical properties of topological semimetals. The realization of novel optical and optoelectronic phenomena in topological semimetals may lead to useful technological applications.

While the electronic band structure and transport have been systematically studied using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and electrical transport, optical properties of these materials remain largely unexplored despite predictions of many unconventional optical behaviors. The goal of this research program is to investigate the novel optical properties of chiral Weyl fermions in topological semimetals. In particular, it has been predicted that, in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields, Weyl fermions with different chiralities should intermix and give rise to a magnetic field dependent conductivity. It has been difficult to conclusively observe this phenomenon, known as the chiral anomaly, solely based on transport measurements. In this project, time-resolved photocurrent microscopy, transient grating spectroscopy and terahertz spectroscopy will be used to optically detect signatures of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals. Additionally, photocurrent response of a Weyl semimetal will be used to map out the quantum geometry of its electronic wavefunction. This will allow detection of the Berry curvature monopoles and dipoles that arise from a Weyl node.

Two principal concepts from the theory of quantum fields are those of locality and duality. Locality generalizes the idea that there should not be so-called action at a distance in a complete quantum theory of nature. Duality occurs in two seemingly different quantum theories being fundamentally the same. The present project develops mathematical formulations of locality and duality in terms of a new theory of factorization homology. Factorization homology provides a mathematical means of articulating a physical theory on all of space-time in terms of physics in very small subregions, within which physics can be simplified in terms of combinatorics and higher-dimensional graph theory.<br/><br/><br/>This project develops the theory of factorization homology for variants of higher categories, and applications thereof to mathematical physics and differential topology. This theory can be thought of as the study of sheaves on moduli spaces of stratifications. One goal is to use factorization homology with adjoints to prove the cobordism hypothesis of Baez--Dolan and Lurie, which asserts that topological quantum field theories in the sense of Atiyah's axioms are uniquely determined by their value on a point. This would show that such a topological quantum field theory on space-time X comes from a sheaf on the moduli space of stratifications of X, and thus that the notion of locality can be understood in terms of the topology of such moduli spaces. A second goal is to show that this moduli space of stratifications of a manifold X satisfies an infinite-dimensional form of Poincar? duality.  This would then give rise to a duality among topological physical theories on X, once expressed as sheaves on the aforementioned moduli space. This duality is a form of Koszul duality for topological physical theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

WPT systems use dedicated sources or transmitters for contactless electrical power transfer at different power levels ranging from milliwatts to kilowatts. Examples of the WPT applications include wireless powering of biomedical implants and wireless charging of mobile devices, robots, drones, and electric vehicles. Such technologies have attracted much interest as they simplify daily life by eliminating the need for power cords required for plug-in charging. Although some commercial products have adopted WPT technology, the technology remains underdeveloped because of the limitations in existing WPT system designs, mainly the position-dependent efficiency. The objective of this proposal is to design and implement position-independent WPT systems that are capable of functioning under variable transmission distances and misalignments between the transmitter and receiver while maintaining high power transfer efficiencies. Another important component of this proposal is the research-based education for both undergraduate and graduate students. The proposed research is of particular value for students due to its interdisciplinary nature, where students will study nonlinear devices for electrical implementation of nonlinear resonance circuits to design power inverters and efficient rectifiers used in systems. These skills are highly valuable in the nation's workforce, where the combination of expertise in materials, devices, and circuits are desirable for today's multi-disciplinary research and engineering in areas involving electronic devices.<br/><br/>The proposed research, for the first time, provides a solution for designing position-independent WPT systems in which the operating frequency remains fixed.

The proposed approach has a strong potential to solve the challenging problems in wireless power transfer systems, in particular the performance variations due to misalignment and change of distance between transmitter and receiver. Upon the successful implementation, the proposed circuits will provide a unique and low-cost solution to design position-independent WPT systems.

The ionosphere is generally broken out by layers, defined according to the wavelengths of the radiation most commonly absorbed. The E-region extends from 90-150 km and is ionized through X-ray and ultraviolet radiation. The F-region (150-600 km) is ionized by extreme ultraviolet radiation. Although waves and disturbances (""structuring"") occur throughout the ionospheric medium (""plasma""), studies often focus on; either the E or F layer owing in part to limitations of experimental and theoretical; techniques employed. As a result, development of a unified view of ionospheric plasma structuring processes remains incomplete. This proposal will fill this gap by (1) developing a unified plasma instability theory applicable in the broad range of altitudes including the previously unexplored transitional valley region between the E and F region peaks and (2) observing the valley region with a radar that routinely receives returns from a broad range of altitudes. The proposed research leverages NSF assets and knowledge synthesis to contribute fundamentally to the theory of plasma instability and structuring. This knowledge is relevant to the communication and navigation industries, and therefore to society. The integrated theory will be incorporated into UAF plasma physics classes, that currently rely primarily on original journal publications rather than teaching modules.

Development a unified theory of ionospheric plasma instabilities including thermal, inertial, and gradient effects for arbitrary altitude and propagation; 2. Determination of the critical gradient length required to destabilize plasma in the non-isothermal case for arbitrary altitude; 3. Analysis of SuperDARN and ISR data to investigate small-scale irregularity occurrence in the previously unexplored transitional ""valley"" region (~150 km).

SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Judy Gerber at Vanderbilt University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of parent strengths in predicting family reunification in juvenile dependency (i.e., child protection) cases. The burden on the U.S. child welfare and juvenile dependency system is heavy. There are 4 million reports of child maltreatment annually; the government spends billions of dollars on improving the system every year; and community providers spend countless hours delivering intensive services to families. Yet, even after these efforts are successful in reunifying children and parents, families continue to experience problems, with approximately 30% of children re-entering foster care within three years. These statistics highlight the critical need for research to determine what predicts successful, safe, and long-lasting family reunification.<br/><br/>The purpose of the study is to identify strengths (e.g., commitment, insight, social support) in a sample of parents who have recently become involved in the juvenile dependency system. The study also will examine the extent to which these strengths change over the course of parents' cases, why they change, and how they relate to parents,compliance, behaviors, and permanency outcomes (i.e., reunification and re-entry rates). Parents who have recently had children sheltered in the juvenile dependency system will be interviewed to identify these strengths. A 6-month follow-up assessment will examine changes in strengths, and will include a qualitative component to examine why families experienced changes in the strengths,notably, a component not included in current strengths-based models. Case file reviews conducted within 12 months of case opening, will determine parents' compliance with services, professionals perceptions of parents, behavior change, and reunification rates. Administrative data reviews, conducted 6 months later, will determine re-entry rates. Findings have the potential to illuminate our understanding of the mechanisms associated with family reunification. Additionally, findings will help to inform the policy contexts that shape family planning and engagement to ultimately improve the lives of children and parents, and keep families together.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cross-ecosystem food web connections will be studied at three different National Parks (Zion, Rocky Mountain, and Yellowstone National Parks), thereby providing replication at large spatial scales and leveraging the opportunities that National Parks provide to educate the public about food web ecology and the role of top predators in structuring our ecosystems.  This research will be the first of its kind to investigate reverberating effects of trophic cascades whereby indirect effects may cross ecosystem boundaries (terrestrial to aquatic) and then subsequently reverberate back to animals and plants in the original ecosystem (aquatic back to terrestrial).  This work will provide a more complete picture of how the loss of top predatory species worldwide may be indirectly influencing many distantly connected species.<br/><br/>Previous investigations have demonstrated the indirect role of top predators (e.g., wolves in Yellowstone Park and mountain lions in Zion National Park) in control of riparian vegetation along streams.  In addition, streams and riparian zones are connected by well-understood processes of material and organism exchange, making them ideal systems to identify and quantify trophic reverberations.  The study will be conducted in streams and adjacent riparian zones and will encompass (1) streamside ungulate browsing and riparian plant communities, (2) community composition and abundance of in-stream biota, quantification of terrestrial fluxes (organic matter and invertebrate) fluxes to streams, and diets of stream biota, and (3) emergent adult aquatic insects in the riparian zone and the response of spiders and bats. These riparian insectivores serve as a bellwether for changes in stream insect emergence and stream-riparian linkages. In each park, replicate study sites will be established along streams with and without controls on ungulate browsing of riparian woody vegetation.  By comparing within and across three national parks, this study will yield a greater understanding of how community and landscape context may mediate the strength, or even sign, of reverberating responses to terrestrial top-down control of ungulate browsing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current nanomedicine uses magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in bio-labels for cancer diagnosis and therapy and for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic thin films are promising in circulators that block reflections from re-entering radar sources, hence eliminating noise and enhancing performance. This project disrupts both of these diverse technologies using three dimensional (3D) nanomagnetic arrays. The arrays are essentially groupings of barcoded nanowires that can be visualized as the pelt of a porcupine - shrunk to fit on the tip of a pen. Individually, the 'quills' are so small that they are internalized by cells, leading to effective cellular barcoding. As an array, or 'pelt', the quill or nanowire assembly acts like a one-way mirror for radar signals. The manufacturing process developed here enables rolls of 3D nanomagnetic arrays to be produced with a yield of one billion nanowires per minute. Undergraduate and graduate student training by two female electrical engineers supports education and diversity and enables students to conduct research in medical diagnosis and radar for self-driving cars for the benefit of society.<br/><br/>Fundamental design principles are established for roll-imprint manufacturing of three dimensional (3D) nanomagnetic arrays, including nanostructure design, process design, and quality control design. Two underlying testbeds, radio-frequency identification (RFID) bio-labels and high frequency circulators for self-driving cars, are used to verify the designs. For nanostructure design, hierarchical nanostructures are composed of zero dimensional (0D) nanodisks stacked into one-dimensional (1D) nanowires that are inside two-dimensional (2D) arrays of columnar nanopores to make three-dimensional (3D) structures. The magnetic spin structures are simulated to facilitate design with experimental verification. The process design involves roll-imprinting of aluminum before anodization to produce aluminum oxide templates containing columnar nanopores with long range order. Electrodeposition is then used to fill these nanopores with single component ferromagnetic metals and multilayers according to the desired nanostructure designs.  Quality control design involves high frequency circuits, including coplanar waveguides to measure ferromagnetic resonance and custom designed circulators to measure composite properties. Importantly, the quality control design is directly applicable for testbed success. Previous work has successfully demonstrated 3D nanomagnetic arrays that were synthesized using planar components with areas of square-centimeter.

First, they develop a novel resource-aware refinement type system, which unifies the expressive type systems at the core of the two techniques. Next, based on this type system, the investigators build a new type-driven synthesis engine, capable of pruning and prioritizing the search for programs based on their resource consumption. Finally, they evaluate the synthesis engine in three relevant application domains: server-less computing, smart contracts, and prevention of side-channel attacks. The course materials and research products developed in this project will be made freely available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such eco-evolutionary processes may also lead to unpredictable changes in biological systems. The application of herbicides, for example, causes a range of responses in plants such as death, stunted growth, or the alteration of flowering times of survivors. Plant populations exposed to herbicide often evolve resistance. It is not known if these herbicide-induced changes can affect other key ecological components of a community such as plant-pollinator interactions. This research will examine the potential for cascading eco-evolutionary effects of herbicide application within crop associated weed communities. The researchers will take advantage of the impending widespread application of the novel herbicide dicamba. The work is specifically designed to capture the initial dynamics of dicamba's use in agriculture. This research will focus on the crop-associated weed community and its interaction with insect pollinators. Ultimately, this project has broad implications for the health and resilience of agricultural systems following human-mediated influences. The evolution of these wild species may have substantial effects on agricultural sustainability, the economics of food production, and human health.<br/><br/>The eco-evolutionary forces studied here are likely to create evolutionary responses that lead to significant ecological change. An understanding of these phenomena is incomplete, however, as few natural systems have so far been examined for direct links between evolving traits and ecological impacts. Moreover, the initial dynamics in such systems are rarely captured. The proposed research takes advantage of the upcoming widespread application of a new herbicide to study its cascading effects on ecological and evolutionary processes in crop-associated weed communities, including important natural pollinators. This work will test four hypotheses concerning the initial ecological and evolutionary processes. Ecological processes to be studied include the role of phenotypic plasticity in invasion dynamics and changes in pollinator abundances and diversity. Evolutionary processes include plant species losses and reductions in genetic diversity. The work will use a combination of field studies and genetic analyses to capture the initial processes in a dynamic that is expected to proceed very rapidly. This research will provide key insight into a critical stage of eco-evolutionary processes that occur at the agro-ecological interface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is also a time of increased vulnerability to mental health disorders and increased sensation seeking thought to underlie an elevated incidence of deaths and injuries from accidents. These behavioral changes are accompanied by complex interactions between hormones and the brain, and a major challenge is to parse out which neural and hormonal factors are responsible for adolescent behavioral changes and which merely coincide with them. Activation of pubertal hormones in adolescence is the primary candidate. In this research project, a new model is introduced that makes use of a seasonally-breeding hamster species, for which the timing of puberty can be controlled simply by manipulating day length -- hamsters born and raised in long, summer-like day lengths undergo puberty early, whereas those born in short, winter-like day lengths delay puberty by several months in order to prevent breeding during the harsh winter months. The proposed experiments use this model to test the role of pubertal hormones in adolescent social behavioral and neural development. This research will advance understanding of the neural and hormonal factors that both drive adolescent social development and underlie the increased vulnerability of this life stage. An additional part of this project is the principal investigator's oversight of a student-run outreach program with the Buffalo Zoo to create zoo camps designed to spark children's interest in the sciences. The inclusion of University student participation promotes and provides training in science outreach and early childhood science education. <br/><br/>This project tests the role of pubertal hormones in adolescent behavioral and neural development, focusing on play behavior, the predominant social behavior in adolescent animals, and the 'social' vasopressin (VP) pathway, a pathway recently implicated in adolescent social development. The goal of Aim 1 is to determine the role of pubertal hormones in the development of the 'social' VP pathway.  Its neuroanatomical development in the hamster model is being uncovered using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Aim 2 serves to determine the projections through which the 'social' VP pathway regulates play. The role of four key projection areas is being tested with site-specific infusions of a VP agonist and antagonist to determine how this pathway regulates social development. Aim 3 involves an initial test of the role of estradiol in early adolescent behavior. Estradiol levels are measured using enzyme immunoassay in the hamster model to determine whether day length impacts circulating estradiol levels in juvenile hamsters. This research program will begin to map puberty-dependent and puberty-independent neural circuits and specify how they interact to regulate adolescent social development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Andrew N. Meltzoff at the University of Washington's Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of social interaction and reciprocal play in fostering early altruism. Reciprocal play is a specific form of social play involving turn-taking. The Fellow's prior work showed that reciprocal play can trigger young children's altruism in the immediate context. This project will examine how reciprocal play may foster altruism across contexts and time. Promoting altruism in children is a desirable societal goal, and thus the research has potential to have a broad impact. This results can be disseminated to help early educators and children at risk. Such information would be especially useful for parents, teachers and other practitioners working with children who commonly seek to promote positive social development in children. <br/><br/>The research involves four interlocking studies that will: (a) examine how reciprocal play can encourage the spread of altruism across contexts, (b) examine how reciprocal play may maintain altruism over time, (c) assess whether other types of play show similar effects, and (d) examine how merely observing reciprocal play among others might potentially encourage altruism. Although developmental psychology has long held that positive interactions in early childhood are important in promoting a general prosocial interaction, this research will examine how specific everyday aspects of childrens' social experience that can shape altruism. The findings promise to have impact on developmental theory as well educational practice. The proposed work also sets the stage for the future design of intervention studies, which could provide information to educators and scientists on how to engender and promote social skills, including altruistic behavior, in young children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Membrane distillation can treat high-salinity and/or highly contaminated waters, for which conventional treatment processes are impractical. Membrane distillation uses low-grade energy, supplied from waste heat and/or solar thermal energy, to vaporize (rather than boil) non-potable water streams. The membrane allows water vapor to pass, while restricting permeation of liquid water and its dissolved solutes.  Design of membrane distillation processes involves a number of simplifying assumptions, in particular, that the membrane is impermeable to liquid water and its dissolved solutes. However, with time, dissolved solutes form a scaling layer on the membrane, compromising the ability of the membrane to exclude liquid water and solutes. This project will develop a new model to address the performance of membrane distillation processes that is consistent with long-term operation of practical, heterogeneous membranes.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new model for liquid entry pressure that incorporates operating conditions, membrane chemistry, asymmetric membrane properties, and the effect of a scaling layer. The model will incorporate experiments that probe internal and distillate-side membrane properties on pore wetting, simple and complex feed solution chemistries, and consider both single- and multi-component scaling conditions. Both commercial membranes and novel polymer membranes that vary hydrophobicity versus hydrophilicity will be considered. An extended Washburn method will quantify the internal hydrophobicity of the porous membranes. A techno-economic assessment will quantify the key impacts of high-performance membranes for high-salinity applications. The project will support graduate and postdoctoral training, while also expanding educational outreach to underrepresented and low-income high school students on energy-efficient water production.

Such building systems could enable immediate occupancy and minimum economic losses after an extreme event, contributing to continued national prosperity and welfare. Progress has been made towards addressing this challenge with the development of unbonded, post-tensioned, shear walls (UPSWs) in buildings; yet limiting issues for designing such shear walls remain. This research will explore an innovative concept for structural shear walls to resist lateral loads in buildings and perform damage free during an extreme event. The concept consists of coupled, unbonded, post-tensioned, reinforced concrete walls that interact with the foundation via a curved surface. Lateral deformations will be accommodated through a pendulum-type motion as the wall slides along the bottom curved surface. Lateral resistance will be provided by friction along the curved surface and the vertical unbonded post-tensioned cables. The post-tensioned cables also will help restore the wall to its initial configuration. Energy dissipation of these coupled pendulum walls will be provided by incorporating connecting devices that use elastic buckling and release accumulated elastic energy during the walls' deformations. The system response thus will leverage the resulting deformations rather than trying to constrain them, as in traditional systems. The result will be new technology related to the design of damage-free structural building systems, and a new way of thinking about leveraging system geometry and deformations for enhanced resilient and sustainable buildings. Parallel to the research effort will be complementary educational and outreach components, including the training of two Ph.D. students, research experiences for undergraduate students, a project website with tutorials and research findings for undergraduate and graduate students and practitioners, and outreach activities for middle and high school students.  The tutorials, as well as data from this project, also will be made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Data Depot (https://www.designsafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>The core idea of this research is that of a new design philosophy envisioned to be unrestricted by traditional material failure limit states. This philosophy will be verified through a new concept for coupled UPSWs. The material response limitations of rocking UPSWs will be addressed by harnessing the nonlinear kinematic behavior resulting from coupled system deformations. Thus, the project objective is to develop the enabling theory and technology for a new concept of UPSWs that can perform damage free and unrestricted by material failure limit states. This objective will be achieved through two unique and complementary features: (1) individual walls gliding along a circular path with no separation at the footing interface, and (2) continuous energy dissipation via devices with controllable elastic instabilities along vertical wall joints. This concept will be designated as a pendulum UPSW system, as it rotates about a fixed point on the wall. The approach to be followed will be to characterize the in-plane response of pendulum UPSWs as viable lateral load resisting elements, develop and characterize the use of elastic meta-materials and meta-structures for dissipating energy via elastic instabilities, and characterize the response of pendulum UPSWs coupled with elastic multi-stable structures as connectors. A combination of analytical, numerical (finite element), and experimental methods will be used. This research will lead to the fundamental integration of system geometry and deformations for the design of lateral load resisting structures that are resilient and sustainable. The study will promote new design concepts that harness deformations for optimal performance rather than performance objectives set to target material limit states. The research also will contribute to the use of nonlinear elastic instabilities in large-scale structural systems. Theory and methods related to damage-free structural systems, friction models, and elastic energy dissipation devices will also be advanced.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Field studies and groundwater models both indicate that groundwater with a range  of transit times contributes to streamflow at any given time. However, field studies suggest the relative contribution of young groundwater (i.e., groundwater with short transit times) to streams is substantially less than calculated in modeling studies. This discrepancy in the groundwater transit time distribution (TTD) leads to a very different understanding of streamflow sources, fundamentally different predictions of the future impact of groundwater discharge on stream water quality, and potentially different perspectives on the design and assessment of efforts to manage non-point-source contamination in aquifers. This project will conduct field measurements and groundwater modeling to investigate differences in groundwater TTDs, and to determine and understand the processes that drive TTD at a range of spatial scales. Results of the project will assist water resources managers, regulators, and consultants to better understand and manage both water quantity and quality. Information will be disseminated through Cooperative Extension programs.<br/><br/>The overall goals of this project are to (1) evaluate why there is a discrepancy between TTDs derived from groundwater measurements (field sampling of age-dating tracers) and groundwater models, (2) investigate how these processes may be better understood by using both field measurements and models in nested watersheds at a range of scales (14-3900 km2 in this project) and (3) determine the processes that control the shape of the groundwater TTDs,. This project will be conducted in a watershed overlying the High Plains aquifer in the Nebraska Sandhills, where groundwater accounts for approximately 90% of the annual stream discharge. The TTDs will be determined using age-dating tracers for both young and old groundwater (3H/3He, SF6, 14C, 4He). Groundwater age information will be coupled with discharge measurements in streams and groundwater discharge measurement from tube seepage meters in streambeds. The tracer-based TTDs will be compared to groundwater TTDs derived from particle tracking simulations in a numerical groundwater model (MODFLOW), at both the reach and watershed scale. The model will be used as a tool to investigate differences that arise between tracer- and model-based TTDs. For example, the project will investigate the variation in groundwater recharge relative to the stream channel, and if a higher resolution and more accurate representation of recharge in the model leads to better agreement between field- and model-based TTDs. The model will also be re-calibrated using groundwater age data to evaluate how TTDs compare to field-based estimates after refinement and recalibration.  Information will be disseminated through Cooperative Extension programs, including interactive online training materials at www.nebraskawatershedscience.org.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study uses a 20-year old, field experiment, called BioCON, that raises the carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere above prairie plant communities to levels that are expected to occur later in this century. The experiment is designed to study how higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere affects the growth of different kinds of plants. The experiment is also designed to understand how the availability of soil nitrogen, an important nutrient that plants need to grow, influences the ability of plants to take up higher levels of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Data from the study will be made publicly available through the Cedar Creek, Long Term Ecological Research website. BioCON is visited by over 2500 K-12 students and teachers annually, including teachers of Native American students. College students work and learn how to carry out their own research projects in BioCON each summer. New K-12 lesson plans as well as videos for the sustainability science themed YouTube Channel MinuteEarth will be developed that specifically feature new knowledge gained from BioCON. <br/><br/>Through continued measurements of functional group and functional group mixture responses to carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen treatments, this study will test two kinds of hypotheses. The first set uses a functional trait classification framework to develop predictions regarding direct functional group responses to eCO2 and N (i.e., responses expected in the absence of soil-mediated feedbacks, species interactions, or interactions with stochastic or directional changes in climate). The second set posits that long-term outcomes will diverge from predictions based on expected direct responses because of modifying processes, involving physiological acclimation, functional group effects on aboveground and belowground resource supply and soil pH, and interactions between treatments and variation in climate. The long-lived perennials in BioCON have not yet equilibrated in their response to CO2 and N, exhibiting interactions with year-to-year variation in climate and generating soil-mediated feedbacks. In BioCON, across 20 years, C4 species have become increasingly productive under high CO2 whereas the benefit of CO2 has gradually disappeared for C3 species, contradicting current theory. Understanding these divergent responses and whether they will continue is a major focus of the study, along with understanding the role of functional groups with respect to other long-term processes relevant to ecosystems under global environmental change, including productivity, decomposition, nutrient cycling, and water fluxes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The construction of defined structures within the meso-scale range is a problem of significant scientific and technological interest because it is key to the ultimate realization of ""bottom-up"" fabrication. This process employs structurally- and functionally-defined nano-scale building blocks for the creation of meso-scale objects of defined size, composition, pattern, and morphology, which in turn represent ideal platforms for the creation of functional devices including sensors, actuators, and tranducers. However, the physical principles for construction of synthetic materials on the meso-scale are not well developed in practice. In contrast, biological systems, e.g., cells, assemble multiple nano-scale components into exquisitely-defined, functionally-complex meso-scale machines. Researchers in the laboratory of Prof. Vincent Conticello at Emory University are developing principles derived from the study of biological systems to create structurally-homogeneous, meso-scale 2D assemblies from synthetic peptides.  These principles are generalizable to the field of soft materials. The structurally-defined 2D assemblies represent prototypes for the creation of functional devices. Concepts and principles from this project are being utilized in the development of a new course as part of the undergraduate curriculum reform in the Department of Chemistry at Emory University. The reform emphasizes the integration of traditional disciplines into themes using a blended pedagogical approach. The new introductory course focuses on macromolecular structure and function, which is a topic rarely covered at the undergraduate level.<br/><br/>Two-dimensional crystalline or quasi-crystalline protein assemblies present in living systems display a range of essential biochemical functions including as molecular sieves and barrier materials, photochemical energy transducers, selective transporters, and signal transduction and amplification agents. The native protein assemblies provide inspiration for the types of critical functions that could potentially be encoded within synthetic 2D protein arrays, if their structure could be controlled across length-scales. This proposal investigates methods to create structurally-defined and programmable meso-scale 2D assemblies from synthetic peptides. Peptides offer a number of advantages for the controlled fabrication of 2D assemblies; most importantly, the sequence-specificity of peptides makes possible molecular-level programming of hierarchical order and enhances the capacity for rational control of the assembly . However, thus far meso-scale structural control has been fortuitous and, this far extensive structural polymorphism was observed for assemblies of synthetic peptide. Researchers in the Conticello laboratory are defining methods to control the mechanism of assembly and identify conditions that promote meso-scale structural order. Three complementary approaches are being investigated: (1) controlled nucleation of ""living"" supramolecular assemblies, (2) selective formation of heteromeric assemblies, and (3) implementation of principles based on geometrical frustration. Each of these practices has the potential to generate structurally-homogeneous meso-scale 2D peptide assemblies, which in turn serve as structural prototypes for the types of functional 2D materials employed in devices.  Hence this work addresses the opportunity implicit in the ""meso-scale challenge"".<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The intricate morphology of the abundant nanostructured silicon dioxide exoskeletons (also known as frustules) have led to numerous studies. To date, diatom frustules have been used in fluorescence immunoassays because their nanopores provide large surface areas for the bonding of bio-molecules. They have also been used as anode materials in dye sensitized solar cells because of their excellent light scattering property. The numerous nanostructures on diatom frustules are markedly uniform, however, they are seldom used in the scalable manufacturing of nanopatterns. This award advances the knowledge of how to utilize diatom frustule nanostructures on a large scale, by developing a better understanding of the interaction between diatom frustules and their surrounding gas/liquid/solid environments. This understanding is harnessed to produce large-area, uniform diatom frustule assemblies, followed by the replication of their nanostructures in two- and three-dimensions. Specifically, the photonic properties of these assemblies and their replicas are investigated and tailored towards specific photonic applications. The project provides a series of outreach modules tailored towards educating young researchers, including women and underrepresented minorities, and for fostering their passion in nanoscience and nanomanufacturing technologies.<br/><br/>Diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic microalgae which are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and remarkably diverse, with the estimated number of living species on the order of tens of thousands. As a potentially low-cost biomaterial, diatom frustules contain dense arrays of highly uniform nanopores, the diameters of which are as small as 40-60 nm. To fully utilize these remarkable nanostructures, diatom-enabled scalable nanomanufacturing approaches are explored in this work. Typical diatom frustule morphologies (e.g. Coscinodiscus sp. and Pinnularia sp.) are used to investigate different strategies in developing large-area frustule monolayers. This project addresses the fundamental and technological issues of the interactions between frustule and liquid-air and liquid-solid interfaces, and harnessing these interactions to achieve uniformly oriented compact frustule monolayers for subsequent nanopatterning. By analyzing computational and experimental results of such interactions, this research seeks to optimize diatom monolayer assembly formation through optimizing the frustule surface treatment and fluid flow conditions. Following the frustule assemblies, nanopattern transfer techniques are studied towards the 2D and 3D replication of frustule nanostructures through surface micromachining and micro-molding techniques. In addition, the light scattering properties of the frustule assemblies and their replicas are investigated. The replicated nanopatterns mirroring the hierarchical nanopores of the frustules are specifically tailored towards photonic applications, such as IR absorbers and photonic crystal filters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When individuals prefer different outcomes, how do societies agree on one choice for everyone? Human groups have developed a variety of methods, from despotism to democratic voting. Collective decision-making in animal groups is less well understood, although examples are ubiquitous: a honeybee colony picks a new location for the hive; a monkey troop invades a neighboring territory; a flock of birds changes its roost site. Theoretical models have been developed to predict the conditions under which such decisions should be shared, and how the structure and stability of the social group might influence the speed and accuracy of these decisions. However, experimental studies on wild animals are rare, leaving gaps between theoretical predictions and empirical evidence. This project explores these gaps in a tropical bird, the greater ani. Anis nest in social groups composed of several pairs, which build a single nest in which all of the females lay their eggs. The choice of where to build the nest is a crucial decision, since its location determines its exposure to predators. The project combines field experiments, behavioral observations, and tracking techniques to test how groups arrive at shared decisions - and, crucially, which opinions prevail when group members disagree. This project will provide research experiences to students and a postdoctoral researcher, training to Panamanian researchers through a series of public workshops, and outreach to the public through a partnership with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. <br/><br/>This project explores three major questions about collective decision-making that have arisen from recent theoretical work. First, do shared decisions become less democratic as delays in decision-making grow more costly? Second, can a well-informed minority exert disproportionate influence over group decisions? Third, how does social network structure affect the equality, speed, and accuracy of collective decisions? The research plan leverages a long-term (>10-year) data set on greater anis in Panama, which live in groups containing multiple unrelated breeding pairs. Some groups are remarkably stable, consisting of the same members for over a decade; whereas others consist of a mix of experienced individuals and newcomers. Anis show close affiliative relationships with other group members who are not their mates, and prior research has found that the duration of these relationships affects coordinated behaviors. In this project, conflicts of preference between group members will be created by manipulating nest-site quality and the information available to different individuals. This will enable hypothesis testing of how group members arrive at collective decisions when their opinions conflict, how individuals communicate preferences, and whether the presence of well-informed individuals changes the outcome of collective decisions.  Knowledge of individual life histories and natural variation in group stability, combined with RFID tracking data on interactions between group members, will reveal how social network structure affects the process and outcome of collective decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will examine how characteristics of precarious employment contribute to multiple dimensions of health, including alcohol consumption, prescription drug use, and depressive symptoms in midlife adults. The project will study whether these associations vary by gender and household socioeconomic status, and whether they vary by state-level social policies.  For example, the project hypothesizes that state-level social policies related to financial assistance (e.g., state Earned Income Tax Credit) and health (e.g., expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act) shape how precarious employment affects health outcomes. The project will provide input to social polices suggesting actions for states to take to improve the health of citizens, as well as intervention points for organizations and agencies addressing problematic health patterns in the population.<br/><br/><br/>This project studies both the short- and long-term health consequences of precarious employment among midlife workers.

The analytical sample will include respondents who are currently employed at each wave (approximately age 50 to 65) across four birth cohorts. The project will pay particular attention to the youngest cohort (age 50-55 in 2010), given recent attention to the morbidity and mortality of these midlife adults. Longitudinal models using fixed effects regression and growth mixture modeling will allow assessments of the relationship between precarious work and mental and physical health outcomes by state-level and household-level characteristics.

The seemingly fragile Monarch exhibits the longest flight range among insects. Individual Monarch butterflies may travel up to four thousand kilometers during the annual migration between North America and Central America. This project will examine the distinguishing characteristics of Monarch butterfly flight, including the slow tempo of the flapping wings, the effects of wing flexibility, and the mechanical coupling of wing and body movements. Furthermore, the Monarch flies at relatively high altitudes. Glider pilots have observed Monarch butterflies soaring on thermal currents at altitudes up to 1,250 km, and their overwintering grounds are at altitudes of up to 3,300 km. This project will examine whether the unmatched range of the Monarch among similarly sized animals lies in the combination of large, flexible wings, slow flapping speeds, and high-altitude flight. A multidisciplinary team will integrate expertise in computational mechanics, biological experiments, fluid dynamics, and nonlinear controls to uncover the physical mechanism underlying the highly efficient Monarch flight. This knowledge will be applied to the creation of transformative, bio-inspired micro-air vehicles with enhanced flight efficiency and superior flight range. Micro-air vehicles with extended flight range will improve the national quality of life by enabling long-term monitoring of environmental hazards. These vehicles will enhance national security by allowing long-term surveillance of large areas, and by providing long-range reconnoitering capacity for search and rescue. Engineering models of Monarch flight will also contribute to the understanding of their migration patterns, and thereby support the conservation of this endangered species.<br/><br/>The primary scientific objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that high-altitude flight is a critical component to the long-range flight characteristics of the Monarch butterfly. This will be achieved with a series of experimental, computational, and theoretical research efforts. The flight maneuvers of live Monarch will be measured by a motion capture system in a low-pressure chamber simulating the ambient environment at various altitudes. The measurements will be validated with computational fluid dynamics simulations for the unsteady viscous flows around flexible flapping wings integrated with a multibody dynamics model representing the thorax and the abdomen deformation. The resulting aerodynamic model will be approximated by an artificial neural network for real-time dynamic simulation, from which a nonlinear feedback control system will be constructed via Floquet-Lypuanov theory. The fidelity of the computational dynamic model and the feedback control system will be verified against experiments with Monarch butterfly inspired micro-air vehicle and live butterfly flight measurements. These will provide a comprehensive analysis of the low-frequency flapping dynamics of an articulated, flexible multibody system representing the remarkable flight characteristics of Monarch butterflies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These characteristics, also known as functional traits, include features such as length, height, shape, weight, growth rate, sex, and reproductive state. Studying these traits provides insights into how communities of different types of animals come together and how species and communities respond to changes in their environment over time, which is critical for conservation efforts. However, very little information about functional traits is available, and what is available is difficult to combine with other data. How these traits are influenced by environmental changes - such as climate change, pollution, urbanization and human predation - and how they shift over longer timescales are poorly understood, and the need for this information is outstripping the speed with which scientists can collect these data. Digitized collections of animals representing life from the past two million years contain a treasure trove of information about these individuals' functional traits, but these data are stored in multiple places and in different formats. Researchers may have recorded dates differently, for example, or used a variety of terms to describe a single physical feature. Making these data widely available in standardized formats could help scientists study changes in functional traits through time, linking their observations of traits of modern animals to those from fossil and archaeological records. The Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies (FuTRES) project will gather trait data from digitized records; to engage communities of researchers to make these data available, standardized, and useable; and to develop a more complete workflow for using these data in research. <br/><br/>Functional trait data have revolutionized ecology and are transforming paleontology, but acquiring them requires extensive labor, not only in measuring traits but in managing and communicating the resulting data. When trait data are lacking, researchers substitute average values, or other characteristics like behavioral or dietary categories. These substitutes - assigned at the species level - obscure intraspecific changes in traits. FuTRES fills the clear need for informatics tools that give researchers access to existing trait data and a place to store new data as they are generated. FuTRES is assembling a varied collection of existing trait data, building a pipeline that converts data to an integrated, semantically enriched form, and developing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web platform to serve the data. One of the key innovations of FuTRES is the use of ontologies, an information science approach that creates computer-readable definitions of traits and describes the interrelationships of traits, organisms, collecting events, and other entities. In this way, FuTRES will make functional trait data searchable through reference to time, space, and vertebrate anatomy.  FuTRES will also provide access to trait data via popular data portals (e.g., VertNet) and software such as R, opening the data to scientists in biodiversity and other domains. The toolkit will be tested with mammalian use cases that leverage the massive scale of the unlocked data.  In sum, newly created access mechanisms and tools will provide novel approaches for analyses of trait variation across space and time, providing researchers in disparate fields discovery capabilities for relevant data that would otherwise have been invisible to them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how this process works inside the cell will provide insight into how cells sense and respond to changes in gene expression, and more broadly will define how gene expression changes in the course of evolution. This project will also train students in new genome-editing technology, which is a method to alter the DNA sequence of cells in a very specific and controlled manner. The technology is expected to have a major impact upon biological research in the coming years, and the students trained will be among the first to learn this technology in a classroom setting.<br/><br/>The specific goals for this project are to understand how expression of one gene changes when the function of a related gene is lost, a process termed paralogous compensation, and can contribute to genetic redundancy. This research will help to determine how the expression of duplicate genes changes during evolution, and will be informative in determining how cells detect and respond to changes in gene expression. To define what component of the first gene needs to be non-functional to trigger expression of the second gene (for example, accumulation of mRNA or of protein from the primary gene), different mutant versions of the primary gene will be created and expressed in a mutant background for the primary gene. The engineered lines will be analyzed to define the circumstances under which paralogous compensation is triggered in the cell. In parallel, the transcriptional regulation of the secondary gene will be analyzed, in order to define sequences and regulatory factors that control the different phases of the expression of the secondary gene. The studies will provide mechanistic insight into the common but relatively understudied process of paralogous compensation. In Broader Impacts, undergraduate and graduate students will learn new CRISPR-based genome editing technology, in a hands-on curriculum where students knock out Drosophila genes.

How the size and temperature of the AWP responds to climate change, however, is not well-understood, in large part because the instrumental record of ocean temperature is too short to enable accurate evaluation of variability on the decadal and multi-decadal timescales over which climate change occurs. Massive long-lived corals that grew on reefs in the AWP record this information in the geochemistry of their skeletons. This project will utilize a newly developed coral paleothermometer, Sr-U, to reconstruct continuous records of temperature in the AWP during and since the Little Ice Age (the last ~500 years). The project includes mentorship of a postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students from the Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and University of Puerto Rico (UPR) who will participate in fieldwork, laboratory analyses and manuscript preparation. A successful outcome will provide the data needed to characterize the influence of anthropogenic warming on the AWP and to evaluate the skill of model projections of future climate change in the Atlantic sector. <br/><br/>As the second largest body of warm water on the planet, the AWP exerts a significant influence on climate. Sea surface temperatures (SST) in the western tropical AWP are correlated to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), hurricane intensities and precipitation anomalies in the northeastern Pacific, Central America, and southeastern United States. Yet, the pre-20th century SST evolution of the AWP is poorly constrained, limiting our understanding of the sensitivity of AWP temperature, size, and variability to the natural and anthropogenic forcing of climate. This project will apply a novel new coral paleothermometer, Sr-U, to reconstruct continuous records of SST over the past 500 years using corals sampled at three locations ideally placed to study the expansion and contraction of the AWP on multidecadal time scales. The new data, from corals collected near the eastern Yucatan Peninsula, US Virgin Islands and Bahamas, will enable evaluation of the timing and nature of the anthropogenic imprint on the AWP, the persistence of multi-decadal variability in the AWP, the sensitivity of AWP SSTs to solar, volcanic and internal forcing, and the link between AWP and Atlantic hurricane variability. SST records from these three sites will also provide new evidence for the overall magnitude of LIA cooling in the WTA, a subject of great uncertainty, and be used to evaluate the skill of model projections of future climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In doing so, we will advance understanding of (i) how logjams affect water quality and stream communities in forested watersheds, (ii) the effects of historical and continuing human alteration of river corridors in forested regions, and (iii) how to design artificial logjams in rivers to manage stream temperature, nutrients, and aquatic communities. Our work will be shared with resource managers and practitioners to help with issues associated with river management and restoration. Student participation will include (i) K-12 students via course materials that will be developed in collaboration with elementary school teachers; (ii) undergraduate students involved in field data collection and analysis, including students from diverse backgrounds; and (iii) graduate students responsible for the primary data analysis and interpretation, who will have the opportunity to work with and mentor the undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>The benefits of large wood (LW) in river corridors are numerous, including the potential to enhance hyporheic exchange flow (HEF). Existing work has focused on HEF near single logs or single logjams. However, natural channels in forested regions with minimal human alteration commonly contain abundant dispersed LW pieces and multiple logjams spaced irregularly along the channel. We have little indication of whether multiple channel-spanning logjams produce an additive or nonlinear effect on HEF, but these alternatives have important implications for understanding river ecosystem function and for river management and restoration. Our primary objective is to quantify how HEF changes with increasing channel heterogeneity associated with channel-spanning logjams. We will use field measurements, physical experiments, and numerical models to evaluate the characteristics of HEF associated with different spatial densities of channel-spanning logjams. We expect nonlinear relations between logjams and HEF to result from increased bedforms such as pools that maximize flux rates, increased head gradients associated with decreased downstream spacing between logjam-induced backwaters, and thicker deposits of sand and gravel, which act together to create steep hydraulic head gradients within thick, permeable bed sequences. We also expect a nonlinear relation between logjams and HEF at the transition to anabranching as a result of the enhanced HEF between divided channels.  Implications of this work will be with respect to engineered logjams, which are currently being added to rivers, but with no systematic understanding of how the effects of LW addition scale with river size, the volume and spatial distribution of wood addition, or the characteristics of the wood and the channel, constraining our ability to design LW-based river restoration to achieve a desired level of HEF.

For most animals (insects, fish, plankton) in streams and lakes the carbon starts out as carbon dioxide and then is captured by algae and plants. This carbon then passes on to plankton, insects, and fish. Recent studies suggest there might be other sources of carbon in rivers such as methane that are supporting aquatic plants and algae. However, little is known about the sources of this methane and how it gets incorporated into the life in rivers, streams, and lakes. Methane may be released to groundwater and streams in areas with high geologic or geothermal activity. This EAGER award will conduct the first study to explore the role of geologic and fossil methane as an alternative carbon source in supporting life in river floodplains. The award will also support research training of students and doctoral scholars, engage fish hatchery managers in citizen science research, and provide knowledge of how river systems function to the public.<br/><br/> The underlying assumption for most ecosystems on Earth is that the fixation of modern carbon dioxide drives productivity and biodiversity, with little recognition or study of other potential carbon pathways (e.g., methane) as drivers of productivity and biodiversity. Despite the likely contribution of fossil and geologic methane to freshwater systems and the potential for methane to be transformed ecologically into less harmful forms, the freshwater biotic processes affecting this greenhouse gas source are poorly known. This EAGER award will investigate the role of abiotic, thermogenic, and fossil methanogenic methane subsidies in supporting freshwater floodplain ecosystems by providing a carbon source to the carbon-limited shallow aquifer food web (deep hyporheic zone). The objective of this award is to quantify contributions of carbon from various methane sources to the aquifer food web. Innovative stable isotope methods will be used to assess the carbon sources and trace them through the floodplain foodweb, then develop new approaches for discovering methane source contributions to freshwater ecosystems. This research could potentially shift the current carbon dioxide-based paradigm of driving productivity and biodiversity by demonstrating that shallow aquifer food webs below river floodplains are driven by geologic and fossil methane-derived carbon. Therefore, these floodplain aquifers would be the first to demonstrate a conceptually and ecologically analogous paradigm to oceanic hydrothermal vent ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Casey Lew-Williams at Princeton University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating how bilingual children learn from the different speakers around them. Not all children growing up in bilingual homes become equally proficient in both their languages, and there is currently no consensus about the most effective way to promote bilingualism. This project is designed to address a common question raised by bilingual parents: is it easier for children to learn two languages when different people speak each languages Bilingual children, particularly Latinx children in the United States, face a uniquely challenging linguistic environment, as they must learn two languages in the same amount of time that monolingual children learn only one. Therefore, this work will provide insights that are both crucial for the scientific understanding of bilingualism and of great interest to parents, educators, and clinicians seeking to improve language outcomes for bilingual children.<br/><br/>It has been suggested that dual-language learning may be easier when each language can be associated with a particular speaker (e.g., one parent speaks one language; the other parent speaks the second). However, despite its intuitive appeal, there have been no direct empirical tests of this proposal. This research will assess whether reliable associations between speaker and language facilitate learning for Spanish-English bilingual infants and toddlers in both real and simulated bilingual environments. Study 1 will provide the first empirical test of whether bilingual and/or monolingual infants keep track of the languages used by new speakers. Studies 2 and 3 will then ask whether consistent speaker cues facilitate bilingual language learning. Study 2 will use a lab-based manipulation to test whether or not bilingual toddlers are better able to learn new labels produced by speakers who consistently use one language. Study 3 will extend these questions to real home environments and ask whether or not caregivers who consistently use one language have toddlers who show enhanced vocabulary development. Results from these studies will shed light on how bilinguals successfully navigate complex linguistic environments and provide insight into mechanisms of early learning. In doing so, this work could inform future practices and interventions designed to promote dual-language learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Univariate extremes methods are well-developed, but there is a need for easily implementable statistical methods to describe and model extremal dependence in high dimensions, and in the time series and spatial contexts.  Linear statistical methods including traditional multivariate analysis, time series, and spatial statistics are ubiquitous in non-extreme statistics.  Recently, the PI and coauthor connected the seemingly disparate areas of linear statistical methods and extreme value analyses by utilizing transformed-linear operations. An extension of this approach will be used to develop methods for analyzing high-dimensional extremal dependence, modeling extremal dependence in time, and modeling spatial extremes. Because the proposed work is inspired by existing linear models and methods in the non-extreme setting, the models and methods will be relatively simple and familiar. <br/><br/>This project will produce statistical methods for describing and modeling extremal dependence via applying transformed-linear operations. In a recently submitted paper, the PI and coauthor link linear algebra to regular variation, a widely-used and theoretically-justified framework for extremal dependence, via transformed linear operations. The PI and coauthor obtain a sensible vector space for extremes yielding the notion of basis, propose an extremes analog to the covariance matrix, and perform an eigendecomposition of this matrix useful for understanding high-dimensional tail dependence.  This project aims to develop a simple linear model for extreme spatial data, analogous to the spatial autoregressive model in non-extreme spatial statistics, and transformed-linear time series models inspired by familiar ARMA models, but appropriate for extreme time series data. This project will also develop inference procedures for both the spatial and time series models.  Furthermore, this project will further develop linear methods for understanding extremal dependence in high dimensions and explore the idea of conditional dependence and independence for extremes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two principal concepts from the theory of quantum fields are those of locality and duality. Locality generalizes the idea that there should not be so-called action at a distance in a complete quantum theory of nature. Duality occurs in two seemingly different quantum theories being fundamentally the same. The present project develops mathematical formulations of locality and duality in terms of a new theory of factorization homology. Factorization homology provides a mathematical means of articulating a physical theory on all of space-time in terms of physics in very small subregions, within which physics can be simplified in terms of combinatorics and higher-dimensional graph theory.<br/><br/><br/>This project develops the theory of factorization homology for variants of higher categories, and applications thereof to mathematical physics and differential topology. This theory can be thought of as the study of sheaves on moduli spaces of stratifications. One goal is to use factorization homology with adjoints to prove the cobordism hypothesis of Baez--Dolan and Lurie, which asserts that topological quantum field theories in the sense of Atiyah's axioms are uniquely determined by their value on a point. This would show that such a topological quantum field theory on space-time X comes from a sheaf on the moduli space of stratifications of X, and thus that the notion of locality can be understood in terms of the topology of such moduli spaces. A second goal is to show that this moduli space of stratifications of a manifold X satisfies an infinite-dimensional form of Poincar? duality.  This would then give rise to a duality among topological physical theories on X, once expressed as sheaves on the aforementioned moduli space. This duality is a form of Koszul duality for topological physical theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At present, global climate models do a poor job of predicting recent observed declines in Arctic sea ice, and the causes of this discrepancy remain unclear. One interpretation is that models may not be sensitive enough to capture the response of sea ice to greenhouse warming. However, another possibility is that natural cycles have accelerated the recent Arctic sea ice loss. Solving this problem has important implications not only for the interpretation of recent Arctic climate change but also the future projection for the Arctic, including the question as to when we will see the first ice free summer in the Arctic. The study will conduct targeted simulations and place these simulations in the context of observations over the last 117 years. As a result, we expect to better understand how well models capture naturally occurring variations of the Arctic climate and sea ice, and how we can improve models to yield more confident predictions.

First, the investigators will use data assimilation techniques in a global earth system model and explore how tropical sea surface temperature contributes to the recent sea ice decline via teleconnections to the high latitudes. The investigators will then examine dynamical mechanisms that link Arctic circulation to remote drivers in the tropics and put circulation changes over the last 40 years into the context of longer centennial term changes. Finally, results will help evaluate model skill for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and determine whether the tropical drivers represent a main source of modeled internal variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In parallel, the complexity and volume of the data have been increasing proportionally.  The main goal of this three-year project is to tightly couple these multi-dimensional observations with theory, analysis tools, and modeling to obtain new knowledge and make fundamental scientific discoveries in solar physics, particularly about the nature of the physical drivers of the solar activity.   The solar activity depends critically on coronal magnetism, which, broadly speaking, includes magnetic field generation, control of morphology/topology, temporal evolution, and transformation into kinetic, thermal, and non-thermal energies in the Sun's corona, as well as coupling between the magnetic and thermal structures.  The ability to measure the coronal magnetic field and its changes on dynamic time scales is critically needed to uncover fundamental physics driving solar flares, eruptions, and activity.  While reliable direct measurement of coronal magnetic fields has been lacking, this project aims to radically change the situation by taking full advantage of the large wealth of high resolution data and modeling that is finally becoming available.  Specifically, a practical opportunity for routine use of radio observations of the Sun's corona for probing the magnetic structures involved in solar flares has recently become available for the first time from the new, fully functional microwave interferometer -- the NJIT's Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) -- which has started regular interferometric observations of the Sun.  To make sense of these highly demanding data, with progressively increasing volume and complexity, and to integrate these data into a full synthetic picture of the magnetic and thermal structure along with accelerated non-thermal electrons in solar flares, this project will utilize sophisticated models that combine the most advanced theories, computational codes, and simulation tools with the data.<br/><br/>This project includes broad dissemination of the new knowledge gathered in solar radio-astronomy to enhance scientific understanding not only in solar physics, but also throughout astrophysics.  The fundamental nature of EOVSA's observations ensures a broad impact on the field of solar physics, including future instrument development for the DIKIST, FASR, etc.  The work will result in user-friendly software tools that will be made widely available to the solar and space weather community through the Solarsoft IDL distribution library.  These modeling tools will be used during the summer internships at the NJIT's Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research (CSTR), where the project team recruits local junior high school students to participate in cutting-edge solar research.  In addition, being performed within highly diverse environment provided by the CSTR at NJIT, the various project activities will advance discovery and understanding, while promoting teaching, training and learning.  In particular, the easy-to-use tools to be developed during this project make great learning tools that will be widely used in graduate courses at the CSTR, such as ""Radio Astronomy,"" <br/>""Solar Physics,"" and ""Plasma Physics and MHD.""<br/><br/>The three-year project emphasizes the unique ability of EOVSA to quantify evolution of solar flares by dynamically measuring coronal magnetic fields along with the thermal and non-thermal electron distributions with high spatial and temporal resolution.  The project objectives include: (i) obtain evolving maps of coronal magnetic field and electron distributions in the flaring loops; (ii) build consistent evolving three-dimensional models of solar flares that, through forward fitting, simultaneously fit all available data, including the magnetic field, radio, X-ray, EUV and others; and, (iii) provide open access to these product to the scientists and the public.  The project team will adopt an integrated research approach that brings together new microwave imaging data available from the EOVSA, data from other ground-based instruments as opportunities allow, and data from the latest space missions, coupled with advanced modeling and forward-fitting, to obtain the three-dimensional magnetic field and particle distributions in flaring loops.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tremendous diversity in the animal kingdom has given scientists almost endless opportunities to address fundamental questions about brain and behavior. In addition, exploration of the many unique nervous system specializations of organisms will expand perspectives how the nervous system works and, in turn, inspire new designs in engineering. Lastly, an evolutionary framework is essential for interpreting the relationship of structure to function. By building a neuroscience community around research in non-model organisms, one that shares ideas and resources, this research coordination network is expected to advance research in non-model systems broadly, even in ways that reach beyond neuroscience. By leading discussions of key topics for the future of neuroscience, the network is expected to provide expert scientific perspectives to the neuroscience community, policy makers, and others. Communication beyond the scientific community is certain to enhance the public's excitement about neuroscience. Educational opportunities, including lab exchanges, will provide essential training for established scientists and trainees. The development of a network website and outreach programs ensure that network resources and efforts are widely accessible.<br/><br/>This research coordination network aims to advance neuroscience in diverse organisms with four main goals: 1. To establish a network that includes broad diversity in the participant scientists, in the taxonomic research systems studied and in institutional location and type. 2. To advance strategic thinking about critical directions for neuroscience performed outside of the five traditional genetic model organisms. Specific topics to be explored include connectomics and the development of reference species. 3. To support and encourage the development and adoption of breakthrough technologies and approaches, including computation, in diverse species and research contexts. 4. To communicate products from both goals 1 and 2 broadly. So as to accomplish these goals, a large, open network of scientists and a website for communicating information and for supporting discussion is being established. Network workshops will bring members together to discuss critical topics in comparative neuroscience. The included educational opportunities aim to facilitate adoption of new techniques outside of the traditional models and encourage collaboration among labs, through workshops and lab exchanges. Products from workshops and other activities are shared widely via the website, publications and other mechanisms. This Research Coordination Network is co-funded by the Modulation Program in the Neural Systems Cluster (NSC) of the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS), and the Division of Emerging Frontiers (EF).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AoI is clearly connected to many aspects of Information Theory, Signal Processing, and multiple applications. However, the fundamental nature of this concept has been elusive so far. This project will investigate all three aspects of the AoI, namely its significance as a performance metric, its usefulness as a tool, and, more importantly, its potential to explore profound aspects of, and fundamental interconnections among, the theories that underlie our understanding of information structure, causal information processing, and the context (or semanteme) of information. Especially in the latter, the context of the communication process is emerging as a well-defined and useful extension of the Shannon doctrine of communication. Namely, communication needs not be just reproducing at point B a message selected at point A. Rather, it is important to consider whether communication occurs for a purpose, such as for computation, prediction, or monitoring. Educational efforts will include course development at both undergraduate and graduate levels. The investigators will also strengthen the strong programs of their Institutions in recruiting women and under-represented minorities, as well as the involvement of undergraduate students in research.<br/><br/>The proposed work aims at using the new concept of Age of Information to discover the relationships between Information Theory and Signal Processing, which are two of the main pillars of Information Science. Its foundational core is the context of communication, namely on the purposes and goals of signal transmission. This research will be carried out around three thrust areas: (i) the project will explore how the transmission and the age of received updates relate to the information structure of a signal, and understand how information ages over time; (ii) the project will use an innovative approach to the traditional problems of signal processing by relating Nyquist's theory to causal signal reconstruction; (iii) the project will use AoI as a tool in handling the problem of caching and network control in volatile environments (e.g., internet of things and sensor networks).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

GERD is the most common gastrointestinal diagnosis in the US, afflicting ~26% of adult Americans (>60 million people), undermining their sleep, productivity, and quality of life, and leading to other gastrointestinal diseases. Approximately one third of GERD patients continue to suffer from symptoms despite currently available medications treatment. Moreover, long-term use of currently prescribed drugs has side effects and risks. Current surgical solutions are invasive, costly and carry significant risk. The proposed injection system is expected to enable a novel, less invasive and less costly treatment for GERD, leading to reduction of overall healthcare costs and preventing or reducing the incidence of other gastrointestinal diseases. Given the large market size for GERD and profound clinical need, this project directly addresses a critical barrier to developing such therapy for GERD patients. It has the potential to significantly improve treatment of such a common disorder, to become a standard of care and generate tax revenues and jobs. <br/><br/>The project seeks to develop an endoscopic injection system for consistent multiple injections of bulking agent into the submucosal tissue plane in the lower esophagus. At the heart of this technology will be a novel injection system that utilizes a suction port to grasp the esophageal wall and direct a needle tip to the desired submucosal depth of the affixed tissue. The design of the needle and needle guidance system will be optimized for injection of viscous solutions and will be used for injection of a bulking agent that creates submucosal tissue bulging at the lower esophagus, ultimately preventing gastroesophageal reflux. The proposed device will be unique in its ability to accurately guide submucosal injections to the desired tissue plane. This will be the first system to use vacuum assist for targeted injections into submucosal space. Rapid iterative 3D-printing prototyping will be employed to optimize needle guide geometry and design. Repeatability of the injections with the system will be tested into multiple samples of cadaveric porcine esophagus tissue and porcine cadavers. Impleo already owns an issued US method Patent to inject bulking agent in the esophagus and plans to generate additional IP in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) experimental facility is likely the world's most sophisticated experiment addressing atmospheric new-particle formation.  It was constructed to measure new particle formation under highly controlled, ultra-clean conditions.<br/><br/>CLOUD is an international member-funded consortium supporting the maintenance and operation of the experiment.  Members raise research funding from their national agencies to participate. Experiments are conducted at CERN during 1-2 carefully planned campaigns per year, each lasting 8-10 weeks. These campaigns are planned, and data are assessed, during two major week-long consortium meetings each year, while more focused, intensive data analysis is carried out at all times by individuals, but also in several focused team meetings scheduled and hosted on an ad-hoc basis during the course of each year as analysis and interpretation require. Virtual team meetings via skype and other media are ongoing and continuous.<br/><br/>In addition to providing the required consortium fee, this project will support shipping and travel to CLOUD experimental campaigns and associated consortium meetings and data workshops. The doctoral and postdoctoral students associated with the project will be integrated into an international collaborative network of students and senior researchers who are among the most highly regarded in aerosol science and atmospheric chemistry. They will receive invaluable training in the conduct of international collaborative research.<br/><br/>The subject of the CLOUD experiments is of high national and international interest. Aerosol-cloud interactions are among the largest sources of uncertainty in the understanding of climate forcing and climate sensitivity. CLOUD experiments confirm that ions can stabilize nucleating clusters, and that, for otherwise weakly bound clusters (such as ammonia sulfuric acid, organics with sulfuric acid, and pure organics), ions can enhance nucleation rates by factors of 3-100 depending on conditions.  During the period of this project, three campaigns, CLOUD-13, CLOUD-14, and CLOUD-15, are planned.   The campaigns will focus on the following broad topics: the role of organic oxidation chemistry in new-particle formation and growth; new-particle formation in urban areas; new-particle formation in the marine atmosphere; and the role, if any, of charge in cloud-droplet formation and ice-crystal nucleation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changing such external properties is a key way to control chemistry in a laboratory or industrial setting.  Thus, it is important to understand how these variables affect the timescales of the important motions involved in the chemistry. This knowledge also provides insight into the molecular-level motions that determine the timescale.  The methods developed in this project, for example, allow the direct calculation of the temperature dependence of any timescale (such as the time for a chemical reaction to take place) from simulations at a single temperature.  At the same time, they   give information about the molecular interactions that influence the temperature dependence.  Currently, no other method can provide such information.   In addition to the behavior with temperature, the effect of other properties such as pressure or system composition may be calculated.  While the approaches apply to any chemical system, the Thompson group is focusing on dynamics in liquids.  The award also supports an outreach program for elementary school students to increase their interest in and motivation for science.  It is designed to let the students see what scientists do and encourage them to view themselves as scientists through activities and interactions with graduate students and faculty. <br/><br/>The methods developed fall into three categories:  1) Those enabling the calculation of activation energies for reactions and other dynamical processes from simulations at a single temperature. These approaches provide otherwise unattainable information: the contributions of different interactions to the activation energy. 2) Those evaluating changes in dynamical timescales with physical conditions other than temperature, such as pressure or chemical potential. This makes quantities like the activation volume available from simulations at a single pressure.  3) Approaches for calculating derivatives of rate constants and other dynamical timescales with respect to components of the underlying Hamiltonian, such as masses or potential parameters, to gain insight into mechanisms, force fields, and kinetic isotope effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Laura Pulido at the University of Oregon, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of grassroots movements in urban sustainability transitions. Over the last two decades, the United State's homeless population has grown substantially. At the same time, environmental concerns have become more mainstream. As a result, public agencies are increasingly tasked with managing conflicts that result in and from homeless people living in urban green spaces. In response, grassroots groups are establishing homeless rest areas. Also called tent cities or encampments (and distinct from publicly funded highway rest areas), rest areas now exist in over 100 US cities. Rest areas typically involve a collection of tents and temporary shelters on public and private land. They are usually managed by and for homeless people, providing a safe place for daily life off the streets. Yet, little research has focused on these spaces and communities in the context of the green urbanism movement. This project addresses three questions: 1) What is the current geography of rest areas in US cities?, 2) What is the relationship between rest area communities and conservation organizations and public agencies?, and 3) What role do rest area communities play in grassroots movements for urban sustainability? This research contributes insights for policymakers and community organizations seeking to manage urban green spaces and address the needs of a growing homeless population.  <br/><br/>This study examines urban socio-ecological change in an era defined by growing mainstream environmental consciousness, green urban development, and housing precariousness. Integrating relational/comparative urbanism theory into an extended case method framework, this project entails an in-depth investigation of one particular grassroots organization based in Portland, Oregon that is known for its role in promulgating the homeless rest area model throughout the US. The project then extends from this central case to involve a broad survey of US rest areas (n~140) and a deeper investigation of rest areas in four municipalities selected for their status as green cities and their relationships to the central case, as well as for their variations in region, broader social/EJ movement foci, and rest area developmental stages. A national phone survey, in-person interviews, observation, and content analysis of municipal documents and media coverage will result in a new mapping of the role of rest area communities in urban sustainability transitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The infected plant or animal is called a ""host"" and the infecting organism is called a ""pathogen"".  The interaction between hosts and pathogens is important to understand because it often determines one's health. Scientists are now becoming aware that the host-pathogen interaction is more complicated because one host can be infected by many pathogens, all of whom interact with each other as well as with the host.  Likewise, one type of pathogen can infect several types of hosts, and how one host responds can influence whether another host becomes infected.  Figuring out how all this plays out in Nature requires carefully designed experiments and mathematical models and this project provides both.  Developing a deeper understanding of hosts and pathogens is critical because humans are dramatically altering the biological world, introducing new types of hosts and pathogens in some areas and removing them from others. Understanding how such gains and losses of organisms influences the spread of disease is important to the fields of conservation science and public health. This research program will train undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in the fields of disease ecology and mathematical biology, and will engage the public through a variety of outreach activities. <br/><br/>Humans are impacting biodiversity patterns globally and these changes can influence the risk and prevalence of infectious diseases. The goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic multi-host multi-pathogen epidemiological theory that explains how between-host and between-pathogen competition jointly shape disease dynamics.  To determine how competition alters the amplification or dilution of diseases, mathematical models will be developed and tested using planktonic species and their associated pathogens via laboratory based mesocosm and field experiments. This work will both extend current theory on multi-host and multi-pathogen communities as well as unify theory developed independently for diseases with different transmission modes.  The theory-data pairing approach of this study is likely to generate important advances in epidemiological theory and disease ecology. This work will also yield insight into how future alterations to diversity will affect disease outbreaks in humans and wildlife.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two of these ingredients, magma and magmatic volatiles, play not only a critical role in continent break up, but also the growth of continental crust and atmospheric evolution. Critically, rates of magmatism and related magmatic degassing are poorly constrained for continental rifts on Earth, and thus the primary focus of this study is to quantify the flux of magma and magmatic volatiles during the initial stages of continental rifting. In addition to constraining these fundamental parameters, outcomes of this project will include refining annual estimates of natural carbon dioxide emissions, quantifying rates of magma recharge into hazardous volcanoes, and advancing our understanding of subsurface fluid movement in areas of geothermal energy potential. The outcomes of this project can also inform earthquake models by better constraining processes of fluid movements along faults, potentially leading to advances in earthquake hazard forecasts. <br/><br/>To answer these questions, new measurements of field-based gas flux and carbon isotopes analyses of magmatic CO2 will be collected along and across the rift axis of the East African Rift. Target areas include the Manyara, Natron, and Magadi rift basins near the Kenya-Tanzania border, which range in age from 1 to 7 Ma. By comparing rift basins of different ages, we will illuminate along-axis changes in volatile degassing at different stages of rift development through time. An important goal is to place these findings in context with existing observations (e.g., geophysical, geochemical, geodetic) of key rifting processes to identify spatial links between volatile flux, tectonic deformation, magma intrusion, and volcanism. Field, geochemical, and geophysical observations will then be compared and contrasted with thermal-petrographic model simulations of tectonic extension and magmatic processes (e.g., intrusion, cooling, crystallization, and degassing). Numerical modeling scenarios will be constrained by, and tested against, the full range of observational datasets in the region, including: (1) newly acquired CO2 data, (2) sub-crustal magma bodies inferred from existing 2-D and 3-D geophysical models, (3) chemistry and phase equilibria of erupted products, (4) thermal state of the crust, and (5) crustal thinning. Comparisons between observations and modeling results will allow us to constrain, for the first time, the plausible range of magma fluxes at various locations and stages of rift development at this type locality for active magmatic rifting."

Of all the major animal groups, snails have the highest extinction rates, and most of these losses have occurred in the Pacific islands. Hawaii, a diversity hotspot, supports one of the world's most spectacular land snail radiations with more than 750 species and numerous species still unknown to science. However, the number of species is declining rapidly, and extinction estimates are already 50% or more. The Oahu Tree Snails (Achatinellidae) are the most diverse and iconic snails in the Hawaiian Islands. Research on these snails has contributed to development of evolutionary theory and island biology, yet basics about the biology and diversity of the group is still lacking. This project uses morphological, molecular, and biogeographic data from museum and recently collected specimens to clarify the taxonomy of this important land snail family, and provide insights into their evolution and conservation. Accurate and updated understanding of the identities and relationships of these snails is critical to the welfare of the ecosystem.  Training will be integrated throughout this project, ensuring the development of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The project will assess the systematics of the highly threatened and iconic Achatinellidae, providing a revised and updated classification that will be the foundation for a better understanding of their diversification and conservation. The project will provide training for one postdoctoral researcher, one Ph.D. student, and numerous university undergraduates and high schoolers while addressing the three primary research objectives: 1) produce revised and updated subfamily and generic monographs of the Hawaiian Achatinellidae, including descriptions of 13 new species; 2) develop the first comprehensive, Pacific-wide phylogenetic hypothesis for the Achatinellidae using a modern morphological and molecular approach; 3) assess the biogeographic history of the Hawaiian Achatinellidae and their conservation. High school, undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM will learn a range of techniques from molecular phylogenetics to anatomical analyses and museum curation and digitization, thereby linking science education with hands-on research, while growing and sustaining essential expertise in taxonomy.

This change permanently altered the future of life on Earth, yet little is known about the evolutionary processes leading to it. The Melainabacteria were first discovered in 2013 and are closely related non-photosynthetic relatives of the first group of organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis.  This project will utilize existing data on metagenomes from microbial mats in Lake Vanda, an ice-covered lake in Antarctica where many sequences of Melainabacteria have been previously identified.      From this genetic information, the project aims to assess the metabolic capabilities of these Melainabacteria and identify their potential ecological roles.  The project will additionally evaluate the evolutionary relationships among the Cyanobacteria and Melainabacteria and closely related organisms that will allow an advancement in understanding of the evolutionary path that lead to oxygenic photosynthesis on Earth.<br/> <br/> <br/>The project will focus on extracting evolutionary information from the genomic data of Melainabacteria and Sericytochromatia, recently-described groups closely related to but basal to the Cyanobacteria. The characterization of novel members of these groups in samples from Lake Vanda, Antarctica, will provide insights into the path and processes involved in the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. The research will focus on assessing the metabolic capabilities of Melainabacteri, deriving the evolutionary relationships among Melainabacteria and Cyanobacteria and reconstructing potential evolutionary pathways leading to oxygenic photosynthesis.  The project will focus on 12 metagenomes where the researchers expect to obtain genomes for at least the eight most abundant Melainabacteria in the dataset. Melainabacteria bins will be annotated and preliminary metabolic pathways will be constructed. The project will utilize full-length sequences of marker genes from across the bacterial domain with a particular focus on taxa that are oxygenic or anoxygenic phototrophs and use the marker genes, to build a rooted ""backbone"" tree. Incomplete or short sequences from the metagenomes will be added to the tree using the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm. The researchers will also build a corresponding phylogenetic tree using a Bayesian framework and compare their topologies.  By doing so, the project aims to improve the understanding of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, which caused the most significant change in Earth's surface chemistry. Specifically, they will document a significantly broader metabolic diversity within the Melainabacteria than has been previously identified, gain significant insights into their metabolic evolution, their evolutionary relationships with the Cyanobacteria, and the evolutionary steps leading to the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. This research will have the overall effect of constraining key evolutionary processes in the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. It will provide the foundation for future studies by indicating where a genomic record of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis may be preserved.

Documented field evidence revealed damage distribution patterns that have been recognized in published studies of previous earthquakes in the region, specifically that the complex regional and local geology, hydrology and geotechnical conditions play a decisive role in shaping the ground shaking characteristics of the clay sediments in Mexico City.  While ground motion recordings showed clear evidence of one-dimensional (1D) site amplification in the lake zone of the basin, the uneven damage distribution and ground motion variability in areas of reportedly similar deposit depths and structural characteristics in the transition zone suggest that three-dimensional (3D) site effects played a significant role in the observed damage.  The documented evidence of the role of site effects in Mexico City combined with the high density instrumentation and decades of site characterization research provide an excellent opportunity for engineers and earth scientists to study in real scale the coupling of 3D basin effects and 1D local (shallow) site response, and the interaction between hydrological conditions and seismic amplification.   Advances in our understanding of these phenomena can be used to develop better prediction models for seismically active regions, including U.S. metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.  The overarching goal of this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to combine instrumentation and monitoring, ata collection and analysis, and numerical modeling to better characterize regional basin and local site effects during earthquakes.  The rapid response framework maximizes the project resources by aligning its goal with ongoing and upcoming activities of Mexican researchers and engineers to refine the geological and geotechnical site characterization of the basin, and map the evolution of dynamic geotechnical properties with time to the rapidly changing hydrologic conditions in the area.  This award addresses the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. <br/><br/>On a technical level, this project focuses on conducting dynamic site characterization of strong motion stations and other key places in Mexico City using active source and ambient wavefield surface wave methods along with horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios.  The goal of conducting these measurements is to develop seismic shear wave velocity profiles and estimate site periods that can lead to improved microzonation maps for the city and regional hazard assessment.  Combining field measurements with the spatial variability of shallow deposits and geological information of the deeper sediments from Mexican research databases, a 3D shallow crust velocity model of Mexico City will be developed.  This model is essential for physics based ground motion simulations, given the known influence that small-scale lateral heterogeneities in very soft materials have on ground motions, especially in cases of complex resonance interaction between the deeper geologic formations, the shallow sediments, and the structural vibration characteristics of buildings.  A better understanding of these phenomena contributes by extension to improved seismic hazard estimates not only for Mexico City, but also for U.S. cities that lie on similar sedimentary basins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without fully understanding the mysterious dropout of electrons, a full understanding and prediction of radiation belt dynamics cannot be reached. This is of considerable practical importance due to the hazards to space-borne systems. Many communications satellites and national security assets reside in this radiation environment and their lifetime depends on its dynamics. Advancing the science supports improvement of the predictive models and fits directly into the goals of the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, which was released in 2015. The project supports a female faculty member and will train and educate graduate and undergraduate students in both research and outreach activities. The learning module will provide an unprecedented informal learning opportunity on space science to West Virginia K-12 schools. It is expected to increase the awareness and interest of middle school students in the STEM programs in the state, and inspire them to pursue STEM careers, especially the underrepresented female and lower socioeconomic status students. The opportunities to develop and deliver the learning module will also provide valuable educational and outreach experience for undergraduate and graduate students and enhance their science literacy and communication skills.<br/><br/>Since the launch of NASA Van Allen Probes in 2012, significant progress has been achieved in understanding the strong enhancement of relativistic electrons. However, the fast and dramatic dropout of radiation belt electrons (orders of magnitudes in a few hours) remains unsolved. The open question exists: Where do the electrons go during the dropout? This award is to develop a new and comprehensive dropout model, named Relativistic Electron Dropout (RED), with physical and event-specific inputs to simulate the electron dropout and understand the governing processes. RED will include not only the traditional loss processes (pitch angle diffusion, magnetopause shadowing, and outward radial diffusion), but also the new mechanism called Drift Orbit Bifurcation (DOB). Physical quantification of these processes will be achieved based on realistic field and particle conditions. With these inputs, RED will simulate both the electron dropout observed at high altitudes and the electron precipitation observed at low altitudes to resolve the governing mechanisms. The wealth of energetic electron and wave measurements from Van Allen Probes, THEMIS, and MMS spacecraft that cover the region from the outer belt to the magnetopause and the multiple POES satellites at low altitudes will provide an excellent test base for the RED model. This model will be the first to incorporate all the major loss mechanisms during the dropout, including the new DOB process. It is capable of simulating both electron dropout at high altitudes and precipitation at low altitudes, which will make a significant contribution in understanding the governing processes during the dropout and resolving their relative importance. The physical and event-specific quantification of the magnetopause shadowing, DOB, and radial diffusion processes is new and critical for understanding the fast electron dropout as well as the overall radiation belt dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These isotope ratios, however, are impacted by a variety of geologic processes, such as the degassing of magma during volcanic eruptions. This causes fractionation that changes the original ratio of the isotopes, making them difficult to interpret fully.  Without some means of recognizing these changes, it is not possible to fully understand the cycle of carbon on Earth and the story it tells. One way to overcome the carbon isotope fractionation problem and get a handle on the amount and composition of carbon in the deep Earth is to look at the isotopes of noble gases that are erupted along with carbon dioxide (CO2) that comes out of volcanoes. Although we know a lot about carbon in shallow Earth reservoirs, its concentration, isotopic composition, and behavior in the deep mantle is not well understood. This research uses the content and isotopic composition of two noble gases: Helium (He) and Argon (Ar) from volcanic rocks at two locations in the Pacific (Hawaii and the Lau Spreading Center in the western Pacific), to unravel the story of carbon in the deep mantle and improve our knowledge of the carbon cycle, carbon fluxes, and carbon sources emanating from the Earth. Broader impacts of the research include laboratory and research training of a graduate student whose gender is underrepresented in the sciences; the training of undergraduates at an institution in Oklahoma, an institution in an EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) state; support of an NSF-funded state-of-the-art noble gas analytical facility in the state of Oregon; and incorporation of research results into courses. <br/><br/>This research utilizes coupled measurements of He, Ar and CO2 abundances in both the vesicles and glasses of submarine basalts erupted at two different locations in the Pacific Ocean. One is Loihi seamount off the island of Hawaii and the other is the Lau Spreading Center, both of which have been influenced by the presence of mantle plumes that tap deep mantle regions. Measurements will include the concentration and isotopic positions of CO2, He, Ar, and H2O trapped in volcanic glasses and vessicles. Release of the gases takes place in a state-of-the-art noble gas laboratory at Oregon State University.  Gases in vesicles in the lavas will be released via crushing the lava in a vacuum. He and Ar concentrations and isotopic compositions in the glass will be released via step heating/fusion.  Dissolved CO2 and H2O in the glasses will be determined by FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy).  These data will be used to deconvolute changes in the carbon isotopic composition resulting from magma degassing so the primordial and recycled components of the carbon in the samples can be determined. Key research questions being addressed include: (1) What are the values of CO2/3He and the carbon isotopic ratio in the source region of mantle plumes; (2) is primordial carbon preserved in the deep source of mantle plumes; and (3) what is the CO2 flux at mantle plume localities. Results of the work will be integrated into geodynamic models addressing the cycling of carbon and noble gases between Earth's surface and deep reservoirs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Identifying important differences between original medical articles and news stories is a challenging, high risk-high reward venture. Broader impacts of this work include benefits to the research community by making novel contributions to understanding temporal changes in natural language information, as well as social benefits in the form of improved informational tools like question-answering. For the medical domain in particular, understanding temporal distortions and deviations from actual medical findings can reduce occurrences of harmful health choices, for instance, by embedding the research outcomes in news, social media, or search engines. <br/><br/>This project will develop a large dataset of medical scientific publications, and record their characteristics as they change over time across news by designing and developing discrete time-series representations of entities and their attributes and relations. This task will provide the basis for designing and implementing machine learning tasks that exploit stylometric features in natural language in conjunction with temporal distributions to identify and categorize such changes. This research will go beyond current approaches limited to true/false classification of individual articles, and hence be able to identify and analyze information change in narratives, including semantic changes and nuances, or selective emphasis of related information. The research entails an unsupervised and a semi-supervised machine learning approach with bootstrapping, and exploring a binary labeling task to distinguish distorted pieces of information from those that are faithful to the scientific finding, and a multi-label categorization to learn the type of semantic change occurring through time.

This project will exploit the visual nature of sign languages--where the body parts producing language are highly visible--to determine whether languages change so that they are easier to produce or so that they are easier to understand. In doing so, the project will address fundamental theoretical questions about language change that cannot be addressed by analyzing historical samples of spoken languages. To this end, the researchers will develop computational tools that allow 3D human body poses to be automatically extracted from 2D video. Such tools will be useful for the development of automated sign language recognition, promoting accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, and for developing automated systems for recognizing and classifying human gestures. The research will involve deaf and hard-of-hearing students, helping to increase diversity in the nation's scientific workforce.<br/><br/>It is well documented that sign languages change over time, and it is a commonly held belief that those changes have resulted from successive generations making language easier to perceive. However, most of this evidence has been anecdotal and descriptive and has not quantified changes in the ease of perception and production of ASL over time. The research team will take advantage of the fully visible articulators of sign languages to develop novel pose estimation algorithms that are able to automatically extract information contained in 2D video to create accurate 3D models of articulator movement during language production. The recent birth and rapid evolution of Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL) has allowed researchers to study language change, from the beginning, on a compressed time-scale. By leveraging an existing NSL database--comprised of 2D videos from four generations of Nicaraguan signers--and utilizing these novel pose estimation algorithms, the researchers will be able to empirically assess the extent to which linguistic changes are driven by perceptual constraints imposed by the human visual system and/or articulatory constraints imposed by the musculoskeletal system. The researchers will also query lexical databases of American Sign Language to test predictions about the perceptual form of modern day ASL, and conduct behavioral studies with deaf and hearing users of ASL to test hypotheses regarding the allocation of visual attention as a result of both deafness and acquisition of a sign language. In doing so, the research will provide valuable information about how the human brain changes the tools we use (in this case, language) and the way that those tools in turn shape the function of the human brain. This will provide a more complex understanding of language change that illuminates the complex interaction between languages and the human beings that use them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems of systems are designed to provide critical goods and services. Thus, their collective resilience to the range of disruptions from mild to catastrophic, of malicious, technological or natural cause, is crucial to the nation's economic competitiveness and, more generally, societal well-being. An underlying principle that has guided the solicitation and selection of awards is that to tackle such complex human-cyber-physical systems problems or create new opportunities through their inherent properties requires integration of cyber, engineering and societal perspectives. Consequently, an important objective of the CRISP solicitation has been to foster an interdisciplinary research community of engineers, computer and computational scientists and social and behavioral scientists. To this end, a grantee workshop will be held. This workshop will involve activities designed to: (1) enable the sharing of research developments and findings from funded CRISP/RIPS projects; (2) promote interactions among awardees, including students and postdoctoral fellows; (3) foster the creation of new interdisciplinary approaches; (4) enhance and strengthen the resilience and socio-technical systems community; and (5) enable new collaborations and the formulation of novel ideas. The meeting will contribute to the enhancement and improvement of scientific engineering and education activities through lectern presentations, a workshop-wide poster session, lectures on focus topics, activities, and organized discussions. Outcomes of the workshop, including newly generated ideas from the meeting, future research needs and more, will be documented in a final report.<br/><br/>The workshop will enhance and improve scientific knowledge in the areas of complex, interconnected and interdependent infrastructure systems of physical, cyber and human components. Participants will share their knowledge and research advancements in these difficult multi-temporal, multi-spatial, stochastic and dynamic socio-technical systems. The workshop will also stimulate new research paths in these areas and beyond. Designing, planning for, operating and controlling resilient infrastructure systems, as well as understanding how failures propagate across systems and over time when not prevented, are crucial for building and maintaining a vibrant, well-functioning, prosperous and secure civil society. Bringing together experts from across disciplines and technical specialties to share their knowledge in these areas will aid the nation in this purpose. It will also foster new ways of thinking and innovation. Ways to foster a lasting CRISP/RIPS community of persons with diverse backgrounds will be explicitly considered in the planning and execution of the meeting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although significant progress has been made during the past decade to better understand the seismic response of wood-frame building systems and identify sustainable seismic retrofit methods, most studies have focused only on the structural system and nonstructural component response. Building interactions with lifeline components (e.g., utility piping systems) and soil-structure interaction during seismic events have not been widely investigated either analytically or experimentally. This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will support a team of researchers from U.S. universities to collaborate with researchers from Japanese universities on experimental seismic studies of wood-frame building systems that will be conducted at the world's largest shake table (E-Defense) in Miki, Japan in early 2019.  The goal of this RAPID project is to collect time-sensitive data and plan payload tests for the experimental studies at the E-Defense shake table on two full-scale, three-story wood-frame buildings as a sub-project of the ""Tokyo Metropolitan Resilience Project"" supported in Japan by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED). The outcomes of this research will include a database, recorded using the advanced technologies of the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Natural Hazards Reconnaissance Facility equipment (https://rapid.designsafe-ci.org/), on the seismic performance of typical wood-frame building systems, the efficiency of sustainable seismic retrofit methods, and the complex soil-structural-nonstructural-lifeline interactions.  The data from these experimental tests can be used to advance computational models for the prediction of building performance, repair times, and post-event functionality rates. The results of this research will also enable decision-makers to better understand the nature of interdependency between the multiple attributes of a residential unit and the efficiency of the various seismic retrofit techniques and will assist in planning and investments to reduce seismic vulnerability. The collected data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported NHERI Data Depot (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/). This project will train a graduate student and promote international collaboration between Japanese and U.S. colleagues working together on enhancing the resilience of wood-frame building systems in urban environments through the established partnership of the NSF-supported NHERI with Japan's NIED. The findings of this project will be disseminated through a public webinar as well as podcasts on the NHERI web site (https://www.designsafe-ci.org).<br/><br/>In this RAPID project, the collaborative Japanese and U.S. research team will investigate the seismic resilience of wood-frame building systems tested at the E-Defense shake table as well as testing various seismic retrofit/repair solutions for enhancing urban community resilience.

The objectives of this project are twofold: (1) collect damage and repair/restoration data during the E-Defense tests for different levels of seismic intensity until complete structural collapse, accounting for the interaction of structural and nonstructural components, soil-structure interaction, and lifeline utility performance (both for conventional designs as well as for solutions with seismic retrofits), and (2) identify opportunities for payload projects such as retrofits, various utility systems, and nonstructural components. The collected data will be used to establish a holistic performance of housing recovery based on the assessment of the complex interaction among seismic hazard characteristics, human decision-making processes, building and retrofit attributes, and economic factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central hypothesis of this project is that the intrinsic dynamics of neural networks induce synaptic plasticity that results in increased sensitivity to frequently encountered stimuli. Synaptic plasticity is found throughout the brain, but it is generally challenging to study directly in a living animal. The researchers capitalize on the unique experimental advantages of electric fish, in which it is possible to manipulate precisely and monitor the electrical activity of sensory neurons in an awake, behaving animal. In the context of social communication behavior, the researchers study how plasticity alters responses to sensory input, whether natural patterns of sensory input can induce this plasticity, and how this plasticity impacts the behavioral detection of stimuli. This research has broad implications by elucidating how sensory systems adjust to changing external conditions. In addition, electric fish are excellent tools for public outreach in neuroscience and behavior. As exotic animals, they attract a wide audience. The project includes ongoing outreach and education activities to teach K-12 students in the St. Louis region about hypothesis-driven science and the importance of brain plasticity in sensory perception and behavior.<br/><br/>Temporal codes have been implicated in sensory processing, cognition, and motor control. Recent studies reveal several mechanisms by which central sensory pathways decode temporal patterns. However, the sensory environment can change. A fundamental problem in sensory neuroscience is understanding how central circuits can robustly detect behaviorally relevant stimuli while retaining the flexibility to adapt to changes in the sensory environment. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), in which synaptic strength is adjusted as a function of the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spiking, is found in several brain regions across a wide diversity of species. However, its role in the processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli remains controversial, largely because it is inherently difficult to link changes in synaptic strength at the cellular level to effects on behavior. The central hypothesis of this project is that STDP provides a mechanism for modifying network connectivity to adapt information processing to a changing sensory environment. The researchers address this hypothesis by using an integrative approach that capitalizes on the unique experimental advantages of electric fish, in which temporal patterns of spiking are themselves the behaviorally relevant stimulus. Using a combination of neurophysiology, imaging, and behavior, the researchers are determining how STDP alters responses to sensory input in awake and behaving animals, how natural patterns of sensory input can elicit STDP, and how these changes impact behavioral stimulus detection. The project includes outreach and education efforts that target K-12 students in the St. Louis region to teach them about brain plasticity and how the scientific method can be used to address questions about how brains control behavior. As part of the outreach, researchers lead hands-on activities that include experiments with freely behaving fish, psychophysical experiments on participants, and multimedia demonstrations to illustrate brain plasticity and its role in modifying behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Material extrusion bioprinting is a compression-based additive manufacturing process in which material is forced to flow through a nozzle to produce continuous filaments for layer-by-layer deposition. The addition of the nanoclay to hydrogels typically used in printing will increase the geometric complexity and mechanical integrity of the printed bioscaffold structures. Currently the extruded hydrogel should be rapidly gelled (solidified) to hold its shape immediately after printing, and to support the following printed layers. This limits the selection of printable biomaterials to those exhibiting suitable rapid gelation mechanisms, and limits the geometries feasible without the use of supporting materials that must be later removed. The nanoclay addition to the hydrogel functions as an internal scaffold material to hold the shape of the extruded material directly after printing. The printed construct is only gelled after the whole part is finished; this has the additional potential benefit of avoiding interlayer bonding issues and enhancing the structure's mechanical integrity. If successful, this research can advance U.S. bioprinting manufacturing capabilities and national welfare by enabling personalized, printed scaffolds for skeletal tissue engineering applications such as bone replacement and regeneration. The award will also facilitate training of the future workforce as students across all levels will gain exposure and experience in biomedical manufacturing. Additional educational outreach activities include engaging high school students in STEM immersion weeks organized by the Florida Center for Precollegiate Educational and Training.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to understand the characteristics and fundamental processing limitations of thixotropic nanoclay only and nanoclay-hydrogel mixed colloids. Thixotropic, self-supporting gels, in particular silicate-based nanoclay colloids made from high-concentration Laponite nanoclay, transition from being viscous under static conditions to less viscous when stressed. This thixotropic, self-supporting property is also observed in various nanoclay-hydrogel mixed colloids, enabling Laponite nanoclay as a promising internal scaffold material for nanoclay-hydrogel composite 3D direct printing in air. To this end it is hypothesized that nanoclay colloids prepared at certain aging times and concentrations form an attractive gel state and result in a fractal network with thixotropic, self-supporting property. To test the hypothesis, the microstructure of high-concentration nanoclay colloids will be characterized using scattering and microscopic technologies to reveal their unique gel state. The fluid dynamics during nanoclay-enabled extrusion will be modeled using a volume of fluid-based simulation approach, and the filament formability will be represented using a set of non-dimensional numbers and further compared with experimental observations. Based on the shear and tensile yield stresses of high-concentration nanoclay colloids, the effect of material properties on the printable geometry will be determined using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and experimentally validated. Printed nanoclay-hydrogel scaffolds will be evaluated in terms of their degradation, biological, and biomineralization properties for skeletal tissue engineering applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These die-off events have altered forest and woodland ecosystems. This includes changes in water and energy fluxes and losses in ecosystem services in many areas. The ability to predict how forests will respond to drought is key for applying rapid land management actions to mitigate undesired outcomes. One goal of this research is to improve mortality predictions for pi?on pine (Pinus edulis) in response to drought. This will be achieved through a watering experiment and a regional survey during an emerging snow drought in the US Southwest. Multiple predictions of pi?on mortality in response to drought have already been developed. Another goal of this research is to use near-term ecological forecasting to test these different predictions. Throughout the drought, forecasts of the likelihood of tree mortality based on these different predictions will be done at intervals of 1 week to 1 year. This project will engage the public, land managers, and scientists through a website that is updated weekly with tree mortality forecasts. This project will develop and implement a teaching module to enhance undergraduate curricula and provide education training for a postdoctoral researcher.  <br/><br/>An emerging frontier of ecosystem science in the face of environmental change is to predict not just ecological responses to trends but to predict extreme ecological events to extreme climate events. Among the most important and extensive of such events is tree die-off in response to drought, warming and associated pests and pathogens. Although much research has focused simply on what exceeds thresholds for tree mortality, yielding numerous potential predictive relationships, none of these relationships have been tested with near-term ecological forecasting. Further, field experiments that have attempted to impose drought largely have been ineffective at improving predictions or testing near-term forecasts due to the challenges of effectively mimicking a severe drought or simultaneous mortality of treated and controls plots. There is thus a critical need for an experiment that takes advantage of a developing extreme drought to test multiple alternate hypotheses in a near-term ecological forecasting context. This project will rapidly implement experimental and monitoring measurements concurrent with the severe snow drought emerging across the southwestern US to test multiple predictions of tree mortality for pi?on pine (Pinus edulis), the most intensively studied tree species for drought-induced mortality. Near-term ecological forecasting will be updated at intervals of 1 week to 1 year throughout the drought, based on the frequency of available input data. Through improved mortality predictions and advancements in near-term ecological forecasting that can encompass extreme ecological events, this research will be a critical step towards developing forecasts that provide the information needed for rapid land management actions and account for longer-term implications such as carbon management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Learning of starving children, encountering victims of natural disasters, or knowing of others' economic hardships brings out in people a strong emotional reaction most commonly described as compassion.  The experience of compassion typically leads to a desire to help.  Yet, people do not always act on those desires.  Instead, the experience of compassion sometimes causes anxiety and motivates people to protect their own interests and to avoid being helpful to others.  This project considers some fundamental properties of social cognition that may help to account for these divergent responses to compassion -- to help or not to help.  The main focus is on the concept of goal commitment.  The desire to help may not translate into actual helping unless one decides on a way to put that goal into action.  This project aims to identify simple but effective approaches to assist people in acting on their desire to help suffering others.  A series of experiments test whether thinking about helping goals as commitments rather than mere desires will lower the barriers to helping.  Close relationships, families, groups, and entire societies depend upon people's willingness to make sacrifices on behalf of others. By shedding light on the mechanisms for such behavior and the conditions under which it is likely to occur, this project may open up new possibilities for research and interventions that promote helping behavior in a variety of settings.<br/><br/><br/>Witnessing the undeserved suffering of others frequently elicits multiple conflicting goals. One such goal is the desire to help suffering others.  A competing goal is the desire to protect one's self and one's resources of time, money, or effort.  Based on theoretical models of goal pursuit, this project focuses on the role of goal commitment in resolving such multiple conflicting goals.  Five studies test the prediction that committing to a helping goal will lead people to reduce their concerns with self-protection goals, thereby reducing self-focused anxiety and increasing helping behavior in the form of charitable donations.  The studies examine the effects of exposure to suffering, goal commitment, and the cost of helping on charitable giving. The studies also feature assessments of physiological threat as a supplement to self-report measures of distress and anxiety.  In the absence of goal commitment, it is expected that exposure to suffering will increase anxiety and fail to elicit donations.  In the presence of goal commitment, it is expected that exposure to suffering will not increase anxiety and will promote donations. By examining the connections between compassion and anxiety reduction, the research could inform interventions that increase the health benefits of social engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the Northern Hemisphere, storm tracks span the North Pacific and North Atlantic, and the storms in them shape the regional weather, for example, in the Pacific Northwest, the eastern United States, and Europe. Because storm tracks are the principal conduit through which energy and moisture are transported in the climate system, they are also crucially important for controlling climatic features such as the global distributions of rainfall and surface temperature. Recent observations and simulations with numerical atmosphere models have revealed that climate changes modulate various aspects of storm tracks. For example, storm tracks generally shift poleward as the climate warms and equatorward as the climate cools. However, fundamental questions about the structure and variability of storm tracks and their response to climate changes remain unanswered. For example, it is unclear what controls where storm tracks terminate over the North Pacific and North Atlantic, what their observed low-frequency variations depend on, and how these and other aspects respond to climate changes. Answering such questions requires an improved understanding of how storm tracks interact with stationary weather patterns, such as the Aleutian Low, and how they interact with clouds which on one hand are products of storms and on the other hand modify, through their absorption/reflections/emission, the environments where storm tracks operate. <br/><br/>This project aims to answer such questions, using observational data and targeted experiments with idealized atmosphere models that serve as a computational laboratory. The project will examine the processes responsible for controlling storm tracks by analyzing observations and simulations with an atmosphere model that is simplified in some respects (e.g., it may simplify or eliminate continental effects altogether) but contains relatively sophisticated representations of clouds. The goal is study the fundamental processes controlling the structure and variability of storm tracks and their interactions clouds, culminating in theories and conceptual models of storm track dynamics.  <br/><br/>This research will bridge the gap between state-of-the-art comprehensive climate models and fundamental physical understanding. The conceptual models to be developed under this project will provide a framework for assessing weather forecasting and climate models and will suggest ways for improving them. The project will assess and potentially enhance predictability of major weather hazards in mid-latitudes, including extreme storms, droughts, and floods, on sub-seasonal and longer timescales. It will also train a new generation of scientists who are fluent in the use of the full breadth of state-of-the-art tools in atmosphere and climate dynamics, from theory to comprehensive numerical models. This will be achieved by directly funding a postdoctoral scholar, who, by the end of this project, will be ready to commence her independent career in climate and large-scale dynamics; by partially funding a graduate student at the start of his or her research career; and by disseminating results through publications, conference presentations, colloquia, and classroom teaching.

To date, however, there have been no economical ways to extract this clean 'blue' energy from natural salt gradients. This is largely due to the poor efficiencies and high cost of existing membrane technologies. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Research with Industry (GOALI) collaborative award supports fundamental research on a new approach to manufacturing membranes for efficient energy conversion from salinity gradients, using boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNT) as uniquely smooth, highly charged nanoscale pores. The new nanomanufacturing process enables fabrication of energy-harvesting BNNT membranes with power densities ten to 100 times greater than existing membranes, in an efficient and cost-effective manner that can be scaled up to high production rates and large-scale membranes many meter-square in size.  The knowledge base and nanomanufacturing methods that are developed enable renewable energy generation from an under-utilized and non-intermittent power source, and are also generally applicable to the design and manufacture of the specialized membranes that are critical to many industrial processes.  This GOALI collaborative research, between an industrial partner, Chasm Technologies, and Chemical and Mechanical Engineers at two universities, helps students develop multidisciplinary skills and gain industry-relevant experience.  Concerted outreach efforts to spark interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics among women and under-represented minority students enhances diversity and help fill US workforce needs. <br/><br/>The GOALI collaborative research project devises the first scalable, roll-to-roll-compatible method for producing vertically aligned boron-nitride nanotube (BNNT) membranes. This is achieved with a solution-based approach that deposits and aligns oligomer-dispersed BNNTs under the influence of an external electric field, and locks the nanostructure in position by in situ polymerization. The project develops a fundamental understanding and methods for solution-based fabrication at lab scales, targeting 1-10 cm2 membranes with pore densities of 108 - 1010 BNNTs/cm2. The availability of such membranes provides answers to basic questions regarding ion and liquid transport in highly charged nanoscale pores, the implications for molecular separations and electrokinetic energy conversion. The academic collaborators are planning to work with industry partner Chasm Technologies to develop the subsystems and processing steps (e.g., coating, electrokinetic alignment, curing, and post processing) to enable roll-to-roll manufacturing of large-area BNNT membranes. Together, the team studies scalability of the manufacturing process, membrane yield and performance as the size is increased to 100 cm2 and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organisms can respond by either killing invading pathogens ('resistance') or by reducing the damage caused by pathogens ('tolerance'). Among animals, resistance has been well studied, but relatively little is known about the causes and consequences of tolerance. This project focuses on a bacterial disease that emerged in the mid-1990s in a common backyard songbird, the house finch, causing rapid population declines.  This infection causes severe tissue damage, in the form of conjunctivitis (pink-eye). 'Tolerance' is likely an important way to mitigate this harmful infection. Because the disease reached parts of the house finch range at distinct times, the proposed work uses comparisons among geographically separated finch populations to uncover 1) how quickly 'tolerance' evolves in response to a novel pathogen, 2) the gene expression mechanisms important for tolerance, and 3) the consequences of 'tolerance' for disease spread within flocks. This project also crafts innovative means to communicate its scientific findings with the public. The researchers have joined a global network of science enthusiasts by founding a program that hosts monthly public events where short presentations by scientists or other experts are separated by musical or artistic interludes. Multiple events will feature results from this project. In addition, through a graduate-level course at Virginia Tech this project will train young scientists and educators to design their own programs that enhance public engagement with science.<br/><br/>Infectious diseases are among the most powerful and pervasive selective forces on the planet. Because vigorous resistance mechanisms, such as inflammatory immune responses in vertebrates, can reduce host fitness by damaging an animal's own tissues, selection should favor some degree of tolerance of infection across diverse hosts. To date, however, work on animals has focused almost exclusively on resistance.  By combining molecular techniques and inter-population comparisons, this project directly advances our knowledge of three of the most critical, open issues in the study of animal tolerance: how selection shapes this host strategy following disease emergence, the immune mechanisms underlying tolerance, and the consequences of host tolerance for pathogen transmission. The work utilizes a number of techniques to assess immune responses rarely tested in non-model organisms (e.g., expression of songbird cytokine genes through qPCR and expression of myriad other host genes through RNA-seq). In addition, this project uses experimental epidemics to link differences in individual host responses with pathogen transmission dynamics. Through this combination of comparative, molecular, and experimental techniques, this project integrates the concept of tolerance across levels of biological organization, linking the causes and consequences of this defense strategy from molecules to populations, all in a naturally occurring host-pathogen system. Ultimately, this work will significantly advance knowledge of how tolerance of infection arises in animals and how this host response impacts the dynamics of pathogen epidemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are made of collagen that is susceptible to both mechanical and chemical damage.  Collagen damage can change the stiffness and strength of tendons or ligaments to cause pain and disability. It is difficult to study this type of tissue injury because we don't have good laboratory methods to see the damage as it occurs.  This research will use a new imaging technique that can see tissue changes during mechanical loading.  A novel video camera that sees properties of light that are invisible to the human eye will record how the linear structures of the tendons and ligaments are broken by loading that causes damage.  Visually following the degradation of the collagen during the process of mechanical degeneration will make it possible to test new methods to prevent damage or to treat the injuries. The research will train graduate students in advanced biomechanics methods.  The project includes writing a multimedia iBook on ligament and tendon function to improve interactive workshops for K-12 students and to make it easier to give biomechanics educational materials to the community.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to use polarization imaging to advance the microstructural analysis of connective tissues and link the dynamic organization of soft tissues to altered mechanical function in damage and degeneration. This project will establish a novel reflected-light quantitative polarization light imaging (rQPLI) technique using a tissue analog experimental system and computational simulations. This technique will then be used to track local, mechanically-induced damage in fatigue-loaded ligament and to quantify time-dependent biologically-induced degeneration in tendon. rQPLI will overcome limitations of previous approaches and greatly advance polarization imaging for use in musculoskeletal mechanics. This study will examine intact, large-scale, full-thickness tissues that were impossible to evaluate previously, enabling detection and quantification of region-specific, microscopic, structural changes that occur during loading in real-time. This novel imaging technique will enhance optical measurement of tissue microstructure and advance polarization imaging techniques for applications in musculoskeletal biomechanics. Results will lay the foundation for future projects that further advance study of multiscale mechanics and microstructural evaluation, and enhance fundamental understanding of structure-function relationships in normal, damaged, degenerate, and healing connective tissues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop will be organized by Kim Ruane (Tufts University) in collaboration with Michah Sageev (Technion) and Daniel Wise (McGill University).  Infinite groups arise in the study of topological spaces and in geometry.  The fundamental group of a topological space is an algebraic object associated to the space which essentially describes the number and structure of any ""holes"" that are there.  In geometry, we can study the symmetries or rigid motions of the space - these also form a group.  In Algebraic Topology and in Geometric Group Theory, there is an exchange of information whereby the algebra informs the topology or geometry and vice versa.  In mathematics, one often attempts to understand all objects of a particular type as follows: first understand some fundamental concrete examples and then try to show that a generic one of these objects is either the same as one of the fundamental examples or only differs from it in a way that can be easily described.  <br/><br/>In the setting of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the Haken manifolds are those that contain a 2-sided incompressible surface.  In the 1960's, Haken showed that if such a surface was there, then the original 3-manifold can be completely described by gluing together finitely many thickened up surfaces in a particular way.  One of the biggest problems left open in 3-manifold topology after the Geometrization Conjecture was proved by Perelman was the Virtual Haken Conjecture.  This basically asserts that any compact hyperbolic 3-manifold is either Haken or is closely related to one that is Haken. This was recently shown to be true by the award winning work of Ian Agol.  A key piece of the puzzle was to show that the fundamental group of any hyperbolic 3-manifold can almost be realized as a group of symmetries of a nonpositively curved cube complex.  This is a theorem in Geometric Group Theory which has significant consequences in geometry, topology and in group theory.  The role of nonpositive curvature cannot be overstated and so our workshop aims to explore this connection further.  The theme of the workshop is algebraic, geometric and analytical aspects of groups that act on CAT(0) spaces by isometries. CAT(0) spaces were introduced by Gromov in the 1980's as a generalization of Riemannian manifolds of nonpositive sectional curvature and encompass a rich class of metric spaces that are not manifolds.  Classical examples of these spaces include symmetric spaces of non-compact type, Euclidean and hyperbolic buildings, as well as finite Cartesian products of these. Many examples admit proper group actions, and these groups are often arithmetic in the classical case. Simplicial trees are the simplest examples of CAT(0) spaces and the Bass-Serre theory of groups acting on trees is an important early chapter of geometric group theory. CAT(0) cube complexes are a natural high dimensional generalization of simplicial trees.  These cube complexes are now famous for their central role in the recent solution of the Virtual Haken Conjecture for hyperbolic 3-manifolds mentioned above.  The workshop aims to bring together junior and senior people working in the area to discuss further open problem concerning these metric spaces as well as competing forms of non-metric combinatorial nonpositive curvature.<br/><br/>Workshop Website:  http://cms-math.net.technion.ac.il/nonpositively-curved-groups-on-the-mediterranean/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many theories propose that reading builds upon speech perception and that the quality of phonological representations -- that is, those related to how words sound -- plays a central role in how the brain responds to printed words. Skilled readers who are congenitally and profoundly deaf pose a challenge to these models because they do not have rich phonological representations of speech. This project investigates word reading processes in deaf and hearing adults who have similar reading abilities. Its main aim is to understand whether brain areas involved in reading are impacted by differences in phonological knowledge and auditory experience. Electroencephalography (EEG) and innovative statistical analyses will be used to determine how the timing of the brain's response to words is influenced by deafness and reading skill. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will also be used to characterize how brain regions previously linked to word-reading respond for deaf and hearing readers. In addition, this project aims to promote the participation of deaf people in research by providing an environment that is accessible to them (e.g., ""deaf friendly"" labs) and training that facilitates academic advancement. The principal investigators (Drs. Karen Emmorey and Phillip Holcomb) are committed to improving opportunities for deaf students.<br/><br/>This project contains six studies that use neural tuning paradigms to identify the stimulus-based and experience-based factors that shape the brain's response to orthographic stimuli. Two event-related potential (ERP) studies investigate the ""fine tuning"" of different neural responses (e.g., N/P170, N270) across several levels of representation (e.g., words, pseudowords, consonant strings, pseudo-letter strings). Using linear mixed effects (LME) analyses these experiments examine how individual variation in specific linguistic skills modulate these ERP components. Two fMRI studies parallel these ERP studies but capitalize on the strengths of fMRI paradigms to reveal functional and spatial organization within the reading circuit. A third ERP study tests the distinction proposed by the Bimodal Interactive Activation Model (BIAM) between the N400w and N400c ERP responses (exploiting differences between deaf and hearing participants with respect to implicit picture naming). The final study examines whether differences in visual peripheral attention between deaf and hearing individuals impact neural tuning to letters (using a visual crowding paradigm). By addressing basic science questions about the flexibility of the reading circuit, this project will provide foundational evidence for developing reading interventions and improving reading acquisition for both deaf and hearing people.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental goal in biology is understanding how the environment affects human and wildlife health. Stressful environments, for instance, can make animals more susceptible to infection. But it is difficult to predict or manage the effects of stress on disease outbreaks because there are many complex, interacting processes. In addition, individuals may not respond the same way to stress. This research project will test whether chronic stress weakens the immune system during key times in an animal's development termed 'critical windows' of susceptibility. It will test whether animals are more easily infected, better at spreading the infection, and more likely to die. These results will then be used to test whether environmental stressors make disease outbreaks more likely and severe for whole populations. This work will help prioritize actions to prevent or lessen disease outbreaks. It will also provide a more sophisticated framework for studying animal diseases. In addition, the researchers will develop new teaching modules and workshops to help inform state, federal, and academic scientists, land managers, teachers, and college students about the ways in which stress affects disease outcomes. <br/><br/>The projects will use a ranavirus, an often-lethal pathogen of amphibians, and their wood frog tadpole hosts as model system to test three specific hypotheses: environmental stressors 1) increase the average susceptibility of hosts, 2) change the timing and duration of critical windows of susceptibility, and 3) magnify initially small differences in susceptibility among hosts. A series of dose-response experiments will characterize the windows and distribution of susceptibility (both resistance to and tolerance of ranavirus infections) and determine how they are affected by high salinity and elevated temperature - two relevant and increasingly important environmental challenges. Second, laboratory experiments will characterize how these stressors affect ranavirus transmission. It is hypothesized that the most susceptible tadpoles will also be most infectious. Third, the specific physiological and immunological responses will be measured in the most and least susceptible individuals to better understand the mechanisms underlying these responses. Fourth, a sophisticated mathematical model will be used to translate these results to population-level outcomes. Lastly, experimental epidemics in semi-natural populations will be used to test the model's predictions of how stressors alter critical windows of susceptibility to affect the likelihood and severity of ranavirus epidemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project examines if immersive virtual environments (IVEs) integrated within a climate chamber, i.e., multi-sensory IVEs, are effective for observing thermally-driven occupant behavior and for improving models of human-building interactions. The findings could result in new and effective strategies for reducing energy consumption in buildings. <br/><br/>Building on pilot studies by the PIs, this project will: 1) determine if the virtual experience of participants significantly alters their thermal states and thermally-driven behaviors compared to in-situ experience; 2) determine if seasonal mismatch of immersive virtual environment and actual environment (i.e., simulating winter during summer data collection) significantly alters the thermal state and thermally-driven occupant behaviors compared to those in seasonally matched IVE conditions; and 3) create a mechanism of sharing IVE data and analytics on the virtual information fabric infrastructure (VIFI) platform to support the replication of science in a large multi-institutional research community. Currently, designers and engineers rely on predictive models based on data from existing buildings to make decisions about future building designs. When the impact of context on occupants is ignored, performance gaps emerge between the projected and actual energy performance of a building. Evidence from both academic research and practice strongly suggests that IVEs are capable of eliciting human responses to well-designed stimuli such as in lighting<br/>design, but conventional IVEs alone cannot simulate cooling or heating as in real buildings. Climate chambers have long been used as a reliable apparatus for studying occupant thermal states, but they cannot easily induce occupant behavior in response to design contexts. Multi-sensory IVEs combine the strength of IVEs and climate chambers, but the effectiveness of multi-sensory IVEs to produce comparable thermal state and thermally-driven occupant behavior as in-situ experiments is unknown. This new knowledge will enable the creation of context-sensitive, human-centered approaches using multi-sensory IVEs for building design and engineering, and occupant behavior data collection. Sustainable buildings are essential for sustaining the wellbeing of individuals, families and the society. Buildings consume more than 30% of the world's primary energy, largely for providing thermal comfort. A better understanding of occupant's thermally-driven occupant behavior during design is thus critical tosustainable buildings. Multi-sensory IVEs not only provide a new tool to support the design and engineering of sustainable buildings, but also present intellectual challenges to other scientific fields. To maximize the impact of this research, the PIs will create a novel approach for data sharing and research replication by collaborating with researchers in the VIFI team, a research coordination network called sustainable human-building ecosystems (SHBE), as well as with technical committees of ASHRAE.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project analyzes the discloser's reactions to the partner's messages by examining the ways in which the discloser expresses thoughts and feelings through language.  Videotapes and transcripts of these conversations allow detailed coding of every utterance of the partner's responses.  The coding system is capable of distinguishing among many different statements and expressions that commonly occur in such conversations.  Detailed analyses of these conversations will illuminate the turn-to-turn effects of supportive messages on a distressed person's thoughts and feelings.  The analyses will also clarify how dynamics within conversations influence the distressed person's thoughts and emotions.

These die-off events have altered forest and woodland ecosystems. This includes changes in water and energy fluxes and losses in ecosystem services in many areas. The ability to predict how forests will respond to drought is key for applying rapid land management actions to mitigate undesired outcomes. One goal of this research is to improve mortality predictions for pi?on pine (Pinus edulis) in response to drought. This will be achieved through a watering experiment and a regional survey during an emerging snow drought in the US Southwest. Multiple predictions of pi?on mortality in response to drought have already been developed. Another goal of this research is to use near-term ecological forecasting to test these different predictions. Throughout the drought, forecasts of the likelihood of tree mortality based on these different predictions will be done at intervals of 1 week to 1 year. This project will engage the public, land managers, and scientists through a website that is updated weekly with tree mortality forecasts. This project will develop and implement a teaching module to enhance undergraduate curricula and provide education training for a postdoctoral researcher.  <br/><br/>An emerging frontier of ecosystem science in the face of environmental change is to predict not just ecological responses to trends but to predict extreme ecological events to extreme climate events. Among the most important and extensive of such events is tree die-off in response to drought, warming and associated pests and pathogens. Although much research has focused simply on what exceeds thresholds for tree mortality, yielding numerous potential predictive relationships, none of these relationships have been tested with near-term ecological forecasting. Further, field experiments that have attempted to impose drought largely have been ineffective at improving predictions or testing near-term forecasts due to the challenges of effectively mimicking a severe drought or simultaneous mortality of treated and controls plots. There is thus a critical need for an experiment that takes advantage of a developing extreme drought to test multiple alternate hypotheses in a near-term ecological forecasting context. This project will rapidly implement experimental and monitoring measurements concurrent with the severe snow drought emerging across the southwestern US to test multiple predictions of tree mortality for pi?on pine (Pinus edulis), the most intensively studied tree species for drought-induced mortality. Near-term ecological forecasting will be updated at intervals of 1 week to 1 year throughout the drought, based on the frequency of available input data. Through improved mortality predictions and advancements in near-term ecological forecasting that can encompass extreme ecological events, this research will be a critical step towards developing forecasts that provide the information needed for rapid land management actions and account for longer-term implications such as carbon management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These isotope ratios, however, are impacted by a variety of geologic processes, such as the degassing of magma during volcanic eruptions. This causes fractionation that changes the original ratio of the isotopes, making them difficult to interpret fully.  Without some means of recognizing these changes, it is not possible to fully understand the cycle of carbon on Earth and the story it tells. One way to overcome the carbon isotope fractionation problem and get a handle on the amount and composition of carbon in the deep Earth is to look at the isotopes of noble gases that are erupted along with carbon dioxide (CO2) that comes out of volcanoes. Although we know a lot about carbon in shallow Earth reservoirs, its concentration, isotopic composition, and behavior in the deep mantle is not well understood. This research uses the content and isotopic composition of two noble gases: Helium (He) and Argon (Ar) from volcanic rocks at two locations in the Pacific (Hawaii and the Lau Spreading Center in the western Pacific), to unravel the story of carbon in the deep mantle and improve our knowledge of the carbon cycle, carbon fluxes, and carbon sources emanating from the Earth. Broader impacts of the research include laboratory and research training of a graduate student whose gender is underrepresented in the sciences; the training of undergraduates at an institution in Oklahoma, an institution in an EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) state; support of an NSF-funded state-of-the-art noble gas analytical facility in the state of Oregon; and incorporation of research results into courses. <br/><br/>This research utilizes coupled measurements of He, Ar and CO2 abundances in both the vesicles and glasses of submarine basalts erupted at two different locations in the Pacific Ocean. One is Loihi seamount off the island of Hawaii and the other is the Lau Spreading Center, both of which have been influenced by the presence of mantle plumes that tap deep mantle regions. Measurements will include the concentration and isotopic positions of CO2, He, Ar, and H2O trapped in volcanic glasses and vessicles. Release of the gases takes place in a state-of-the-art noble gas laboratory at Oregon State University.  Gases in vesicles in the lavas will be released via crushing the lava in a vacuum. He and Ar concentrations and isotopic compositions in the glass will be released via step heating/fusion.  Dissolved CO2 and H2O in the glasses will be determined by FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy).  These data will be used to deconvolute changes in the carbon isotopic composition resulting from magma degassing so the primordial and recycled components of the carbon in the samples can be determined. Key research questions being addressed include: (1) What are the values of CO2/3He and the carbon isotopic ratio in the source region of mantle plumes; (2) is primordial carbon preserved in the deep source of mantle plumes; and (3) what is the CO2 flux at mantle plume localities. Results of the work will be integrated into geodynamic models addressing the cycling of carbon and noble gases between Earth's surface and deep reservoirs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A first step for a cell in choosing a direction to move is to sense its environment by tugging at the fibers.  This starts what is called 'cell contractility.'  How contractility is achieved on fibers of varying diameters distributed randomly or in specific patterns, in normal or diseased tissues, is mostly unknown. Understanding the first sensory interactions between a cell and a contacted fiber is important to how cells invade a fibrous tissue, such as when cancer cells leave a tumor, or in directed migration of cells on fibers towards a wound site. Most of what we know about cell migration stems from classical studies conducted on 2D flat substrates or, more recently, using complex gels.  Neither approach allows the studying of cell-fiber interactions.  This research will address the need to quantify cell-fiber interactions to understand cell migration during wound healing and disease. In this collaborative research, by combining state-of-art technologies in nanofiber manufacturing, cell signaling biosensors, and cell mechanics, we will be able to see inside the cell and determine the decision mechanisms that help cells migrate along fibers.   The PI will work with faculty at a local community college to train them in the laboratory so that they can develop educational materials.  This will create research opportunities for community college students.<br/><br/>This project will define the mechanobiological state of a cell as it interacts with fibers. Specifically, we will reveal RhoGTPase signaling (RhoA, Rac1, and CdC42) as cells form protrusions and migrate on fibers. The interplay, localization, and summation of these molecules at specific regions of the cell define the mode of migration, which has been shown to be different in 2 and 3D. To determine the activity maps of these proteins in cells on fibers, we will design fiber networks of varying diameters (nanometers-microns) distributed in aligned and random configurations signifying pro- and anti-invasive conditions. In doing so, we will be able to pinpoint spatial and temporal activation maps of RhoGTPase's as cells tug and exert forces on fibers. The mechanobiological force quantitation-biosensor activation will develop new knowledge in the plasticity of cell migration to changing fibrous environments, as would be encountered in vivo. Linking adhesion receptor-based signaling spanning a wide range of spatial (nanometers-microns) and temporal (seconds-hours) scales with migration and force modulation will provide new knowledge in invasion-driven cell migration, thus opening new directions in drug discovery and development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental goal in biology is understanding how the environment affects human and wildlife health. Stressful environments, for instance, can make animals more susceptible to infection. But it is difficult to predict or manage the effects of stress on disease outbreaks because there are many complex, interacting processes. In addition, individuals may not respond the same way to stress. This research project will test whether chronic stress weakens the immune system during key times in an animal's development termed 'critical windows' of susceptibility. It will test whether animals are more easily infected, better at spreading the infection, and more likely to die. These results will then be used to test whether environmental stressors make disease outbreaks more likely and severe for whole populations. This work will help prioritize actions to prevent or lessen disease outbreaks. It will also provide a more sophisticated framework for studying animal diseases. In addition, the researchers will develop new teaching modules and workshops to help inform state, federal, and academic scientists, land managers, teachers, and college students about the ways in which stress affects disease outcomes. <br/><br/>The projects will use a ranavirus, an often-lethal pathogen of amphibians, and their wood frog tadpole hosts as model system to test three specific hypotheses: environmental stressors 1) increase the average susceptibility of hosts, 2) change the timing and duration of critical windows of susceptibility, and 3) magnify initially small differences in susceptibility among hosts. A series of dose-response experiments will characterize the windows and distribution of susceptibility (both resistance to and tolerance of ranavirus infections) and determine how they are affected by high salinity and elevated temperature - two relevant and increasingly important environmental challenges. Second, laboratory experiments will characterize how these stressors affect ranavirus transmission. It is hypothesized that the most susceptible tadpoles will also be most infectious. Third, the specific physiological and immunological responses will be measured in the most and least susceptible individuals to better understand the mechanisms underlying these responses. Fourth, a sophisticated mathematical model will be used to translate these results to population-level outcomes. Lastly, experimental epidemics in semi-natural populations will be used to test the model's predictions of how stressors alter critical windows of susceptibility to affect the likelihood and severity of ranavirus epidemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Videotapes and transcripts of these conversations allow detailed coding of every utterance of the partner's responses.  The coding system is capable of distinguishing among many different statements and expressions that commonly occur in such conversations.  Detailed analyses of these conversations will illuminate the turn-to-turn effects of supportive messages on a distressed person's thoughts and feelings.  The analyses will also clarify how dynamics within conversations influence the distressed person's thoughts and emotions.

This sorghum grows relatively tall (3-5 m) but commonly breaks and topples under wind, rain, hail or other mechanical stresses. A promising approach to reduce breakage is to develop new mechanically robust sorghum varieties.  To do this will require a fundamental understanding of the biomechanical properties of stalks and identifying the genetic and environmental influences that produce stronger plants. Experiments have shown that mechanically stimulating the plants during growth can significantly change the physical and biomechanical characteristics of sorghum stems.  This occurs because the mechanical load changes the growth of the cells in the plant stem. This mechanical stimulation causes adaptive growth that improves the mechanical properties of the stalk. This research will accelerate the development of new fuel-rich and mechanically robust varieties of sorghum, thereby leading to significant increases in food, feed, and biomass productivity. This project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary professional and technical training.  The team will also participate in a summer research experience for teacher (RET) program and summer camps to disseminate the study of biomechanics and genetics/epigenetics of sorghum to high school teachers and students.<br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, this study will integrate experimental and computational studies of structural morphologies, biomechanical properties, physiology, and genetics/epigenetics of bioenergy sorghum stalks, to provide a fundamental explanation of stalk lodging (breaking) and to guide development of new lodging-resistant sorghum.

These technologies utilize machine learning algorithms to detect important health events and to predict impending medical complications. Currently, however, machine learning algorithms for these systems are designed based on sensor data that are collected and labeled/annotated in controlled environments such as laboratory settings and clinics. This process of data collection, data annotation, and algorithm training has created great impediments to scalability of wearable systems because (1) collecting and labeling sufficiently large amounts of sensor data is a time consuming, labor-intensive, expensive, and often infeasible task; and (2) wearables are deployed in highly dynamic environments of the end-users whose physical, behavioral, social, and environmental context undergo consistent changes. Such changes result in drastic decline in the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms trained in controlled environments. Therefore, it is important to develop autonomously reconfigurable machine learning algorithms as wearable sensors, settings in which they are utilized, and their configuration changes. This project introduces computational autonomy as an overarching solution for training accurate machine learning algorithms, without human supervision, in highly dynamic, unpredictable, and uncontrolled settings. The successful conclusion of this work will enable future wearables to learn in-situ autonomously, operate in-the-wild reliably, and adapt to the changing context of their users automatically. <br/><br/>This project will develop foundations of computational autonomy for wearable-based health monitoring and interventions through the following research objectives: (1) investigating methods of automatic and autonomous labeling of sensor data in a new setting based on labeled sensor data collected in a different setting by designing combinational optimization methodologies for cross-subject, cross-context, cross-platform, and cross-modality sensor data mapping; (2) developing non-parametric label refinement algorithms to reliably infer labels in a new setting based on uncertain and sporadic knowledge obtained from another, potentially unreliable and heterogeneous, sensor; (3) exploring methodologies for training machine learning algorithms that are robust to unknown parameters of a source sensor and adaptive to dynamically changing signal attributes of the new setting; and (4) validating the developed algorithms and tools through both in-lab experiments and in-the-wild user studies.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project will not only address the technical challenges in developing highly performant wearable systems but will also enable actual monitoring of a variety of populations. The work has major broader impacts on conducting high-precision chronic disease management and on the availability of wearable-based consumer applications. This has the potential to lead to the development of products around the concept of computational autonomy and its use in automation of health management, as well as, applications yet to be envisioned. The interdisciplinary nature of this work will provide unique opportunities for integrated research and education. To  this end, the educational objectives will focus on developing a new ambassador program to increase interest of underrepresented minority community college students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) careers in general and in computer science and engineering careers in particular, developing a novel patron program to improve retention of transferred underrepresented minority students through student and parental exposure to wearable-based health monitoring research, engaging undergraduate students in research, and establishment of an interdisciplinary research-based curriculum on computational autonomy.

Documented field evidence revealed damage distribution patterns that have been recognized in published studies of previous earthquakes in the region, specifically that the complex regional and local geology, hydrology and geotechnical conditions play a decisive role in shaping the ground shaking characteristics of the clay sediments in Mexico City.  While ground motion recordings showed clear evidence of one-dimensional (1D) site amplification in the lake zone of the basin, the uneven damage distribution and ground motion variability in areas of reportedly similar deposit depths and structural characteristics in the transition zone suggest that three-dimensional (3D) site effects played a significant role in the observed damage.  The documented evidence of the role of site effects in Mexico City combined with the high density instrumentation and decades of site characterization research provide an excellent opportunity for engineers and earth scientists to study in real scale the coupling of 3D basin effects and 1D local (shallow) site response, and the interaction between hydrological conditions and seismic amplification.   Advances in our understanding of these phenomena can be used to develop better prediction models for seismically active regions, including U.S. metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.  The overarching goal of this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to combine instrumentation and monitoring, data collection and analysis, and numerical modeling to better characterize regional basin and local site effects during earthquakes.  The rapid response framework maximizes the project resources by aligning its goal with ongoing and upcoming activities of Mexican researchers and engineers to refine the geological and geotechnical site characterization of the basin, and map the evolution of dynamic geotechnical properties with time to the rapidly changing hydrologic conditions in the area.  This award addresses the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. <br/><br/>On a technical level, this project focuses on conducting dynamic site characterization of strong motion stations and other key places in Mexico City using active source and ambient wavefield surface wave methods along with horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios.  The goal of conducting these measurements is to develop seismic shear wave velocity profiles and estimate site periods that can lead to improved microzonation maps for the city and regional hazard assessment.  Combining field measurements with the spatial variability of shallow deposits and geological information of the deeper sediments from Mexican research databases, a 3D shallow crust velocity model of Mexico City will be developed.  This model is essential for physics based ground motion simulations, given the known influence that small-scale lateral heterogeneities in very soft materials have on ground motions, especially in cases of complex resonance interaction between the deeper geologic formations, the shallow sediments, and the structural vibration characteristics of buildings.  A better understanding of these phenomena contributes by extension to improved seismic hazard estimates not only for Mexico City, but also for U.S. cities that lie on similar sedimentary basins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A first step for a cell in choosing a direction to move is to sense its environment by tugging at the fibers.  This starts what is called 'cell contractility.'  How contractility is achieved on fibers of varying diameters distributed randomly or in specific patterns, in normal or diseased tissues, is mostly unknown. Understanding the first sensory interactions between a cell and a contacted fiber is important to how cells invade a fibrous tissue, such as when cancer cells leave a tumor, or in directed migration of cells on fibers towards a wound site. Most of what we know about cell migration stems from classical studies conducted on 2D flat substrates or, more recently, using complex gels.  Neither approach allows the studying of cell-fiber interactions.  This research will address the need to quantify cell-fiber interactions to understand cell migration during wound healing and disease. In this collaborative research, by combining state-of-art technologies in nanofiber manufacturing, cell signaling biosensors, and cell mechanics, we will be able to see inside the cell and determine the decision mechanisms that help cells migrate along fibers.   The PI will work with faculty at a local community college to train them in the laboratory so that they can develop educational materials.  This will create research opportunities for community college students.<br/><br/>This project will define the mechanobiological state of a cell as it interacts with fibers. Specifically, we will reveal RhoGTPase signaling (RhoA, Rac1, and CdC42) as cells form protrusions and migrate on fibers. The interplay, localization, and summation of these molecules at specific regions of the cell define the mode of migration, which has been shown to be different in 2 and 3D. To determine the activity maps of these proteins in cells on fibers, we will design fiber networks of varying diameters (nanometers-microns) distributed in aligned and random configurations signifying pro- and anti-invasive conditions. In doing so, we will be able to pinpoint spatial and temporal activation maps of RhoGTPase's as cells tug and exert forces on fibers. The mechanobiological force quantitation-biosensor activation will develop new knowledge in the plasticity of cell migration to changing fibrous environments, as would be encountered in vivo. Linking adhesion receptor-based signaling spanning a wide range of spatial (nanometers-microns) and temporal (seconds-hours) scales with migration and force modulation will provide new knowledge in invasion-driven cell migration, thus opening new directions in drug discovery and development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Insects use their brains to coordinate quick and accurate aerial maneuvers, but with coarse eyes that are immovably fixed in their heads, they cannot stabilize images the way humans do. The result is significant motion blur of objects they need to see in order to fly. How insect brains can so quickly gather information from a fast-moving image, then process it to generate appropriate flight responses, is an important, unresolved problem in visual science. These experiments study the steering efforts of tethered and freely flying fruit flies as they are presented with moving images under increasingly challenging circumstances, such as dim light and low contrast. The results will contribute to better understanding animal flight, human vision, and improve the performance of autonomous robots, such as flying drones. This project produces outreach and training opportunities to impact underrepresented groups through three activities. First, training undergraduates at Florida International University, most of whom identify from traditional minority groups, to carry out some of the laboratory work. Second, hosting in the lab at-risk local high school students from a non-profit organization that aims to inspire at-risk and delinquent youth. Third, demonstrating a portable version of these experiments to the Miami Science Museum's annual Brain Fair, a community outreach event with local neuroscientists directed at teaching brain and behavioral sciences to children in the broader Miami area.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to determine the consequences of photon noise that is coupled to self-motion, and reveal the neural and behavioral mechanisms flies use to counteract its effects. The discrete and random nature of light absorption dictates that when photons are scarce, images suffer from low signal to noise ratios. This occurs whenever light intake is limited, such as when the environment is dim, or when eyes are physically small, or when objects move quickly across the visual field, which is often an inevitable result of quick flight. This project aims to determine how the fruit fly nervous system contends with degraded images just when it needs accurate visual information to coordinate responsive aerial movements. Tethered flies will view quickly moving projected patterns, which will establish the relationship between flow-induced photon noise, regional acuity, and attention. In the next stage, freely flying flies moving through obstacles will help determine the trade-offs of flight-induced noise and steering decisions, in other words the behavioral strategies that address and possibly minimize flow induced signal noise. And finally, sharp electrode elecrophysiological recordings will characterize spatial and temporal responses in early visual neurons while they view fast-moving patterns, which will then form the basis of biological models for viewing fast optic flow. The results of this project will offer neurobiological insight to the study of visual performance in moving animals, and practical insight to the design of artificial visual systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this vision, the research goal of this project is to create a physics-based, nonlinear, multi-scale, topology optimization (PB-NMSTO) framework for designing optimal energy dissipating structural components, within a building, using advanced additive manufacturing methods. This project will benefit the academic research community and practicing design engineers by providing an integrated PB-NMSTO design framework. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students in adopting and using additive manufacturing technologies for addressing complex civil infrastructure performance during natural hazard events. The project also will provide a springboard to educate future U.S. engineers through outreach activities at predominantly Native American and Hispanic serving middle and high schools and will foster increased participation of underrepresented groups in STEM areas.  Data from this project will be made publicly available through the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Data Depot (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/).<br/> <br/>Dissipation of energy in building systems under extreme seismic events is a critical design concern. Steel building systems are designed such that plastic energy dissipation (PED) occurs in special components, called energy dissipating fuses (EDFs), while the remaining structural system stays elastic. In steel EDFs, energy is dissipated through multi-scale processes related to material plasticity and damage, and the PED capacity of an EDF depends on its topological design. At present, EDF designs are mostly experimental-based, and there is little insight on how/if these designs are optimal. More importantly, as the design space is constrained by manufacturability, this design methodology severely limits the performance levels that can be realized by full utilization of the material PED capacity. To focus the design efforts on functional optimality, multi-scale plastic-damage models, combined with topology optimization and additive manufacturing, will be introduced in the PB-NMSTO framework for the full exploration of the design space. This will be accomplished by: (a) developing a fundamental understanding of the multi-scale physics of PED in structural steel under cyclic loads, and then (b) using this understanding to solve the inverse problem of topology optimization with the goal of optimally controlling the physics of PED in optimized topologies. It is envisaged that the PB-NMSTO framework will provide the next generation state-of-the-art design paradigm for performance-based design optimization of EDFs that can be additively manufactured.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The inefficiency of data movement is rooted in the conventional memory system design, which is based on the assumption that applications have good locality and is guided by the primary goal to overcome the memory latency wall. This design principle leads to a memory hierarchy design that progressively increases access granularity from the top to the bottom level. An access at one level of the memory hierarchy moves a contiguous block of data to another level to benefit from spatial locality. As the number of processor cores increases, however, good memory locality is difficult to achieve by programmer efforts or compiler optimizations alone, due to increasing contentions at all levels of the memory hierarchy and the dynamic nature of execution environments. The average utilization of a memory block is less than twelve percent even for highly optimized code, which results in a waste of energy, bandwidth, and on-chip storage. To improve data movement efficiency, this project seeks to revamp the memory systems to proactively create and redefine locality in hardware.  This research holds the potential to fundamentally improve data movement efficiency through new memory system designs, which can motivate a complete rethinking of programming language, compiler, and run-time system designs as well. This project also seeks to train and mentor graduate and undergraduate students, promoting STEM among women and underrepresented groups, and developing outreach activities that raise awareness of the data movement efficiency problem among future programmers and computer engineers.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to re-architect the memory systems to improve data movement efficiency by exploiting fine-grain access correlations. The challenge is that tracking fine-grain correlations could require high meta data and control overheads. This work takes an end-to-end approach to share the meta data and control signals among different levels of the memory hierarchy. A new class of memory- and cache-architectures are developed in this research to redefine locality at each level of the memory hierarchy, which improves data movement, cache storage efficiency, and performance without introducing significant overheads.

Federal policy encourages and indeed requires in many cases that researchers make available for re-use research datasets created as a result of federally funded research projects.  A number of previous studies have found that although scholars widely affirm the value of research data sharing in principle they have often failed in practice to share their own data in formats that are accessible for re-use.   This project investigates the reasons for the divergence between the ideals of open science and actual practice to provide an evidence base for the development of more effective and efficient policies for data sharing and to facilitate development of university infrastructure to better support research data sharing.  The results of this research will contribute to the development and implementation of data sharing policies that are more effective in facilitating data re-use while reducing the cost to investigators and universities of compliance with these policies.  Enhanced data sharing will, in turn, contribute to more rapid scientific progress.<br/><br/>The project coincides with a new institutional initiative at Iowa State University to establish more robust institutional support for the ideals of data sharing and re-use, and a central question in the investigation is what institutional approaches are most effective in supporting increased data sharing.  An initial survey of faculty and research staff will be used to establish a baseline measure of existing formal and informal practices for data sharing and data re-use and their variations by discipline, career stage, and other investigator characteristics.   A follow up survey administered 18 to 24 months later will assess the impact on data sharing of new university policies and infrastructure to support data sharing. In addition, information on investigator follow through with data management plans for funded projects will be analyzed, and data on implicit and explicit costs of implementing data management plans will be collected and analyzed to illuminate the extent to which these costs affect compliance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those with richer social networks experience lower rates of disease, live longer lives, and enjoy better mental health.  Even though the benefits of supportive relationships are well established, less is known about how and why those outcomes occur.  This project focuses on common stressful events that people experience every day, and the conversations people have with others to cope with those events.  It is expected that conversations about everyday stressors help people think and feel differently about their problems, which may help account for the short- and long-term health benefits so commonly found.  This project develops a new method for the coding and analysis of conversations about personal problems.  Tools will be developed to train laypersons and professionals in how to be most helpful in supportive conversations, ultimately benefiting people's health and well-being.<br/><br/>This project uses data from four previously conducted studies in which 461 people disclosed a personal stressor to a stranger, friend, or dating partner.  The project analyzes the discloser's reactions to the partner's messages by examining the ways in which the discloser expresses thoughts and feelings through language.  Videotapes and transcripts of these conversations allow detailed coding of every utterance of the partner's responses.  The coding system is capable of distinguishing among many different statements and expressions that commonly occur in such conversations.  Detailed analyses of these conversations will illuminate the turn-to-turn effects of supportive messages on a distressed person's thoughts and feelings.  The analyses will also clarify how dynamics within conversations influence the distressed person's thoughts and emotions.  This project will contribute to future research aimed at developing machine-coding systems for categorizing and quantifying aspects of enacted social support, while also compiling data-analytical tools that will enable researchers to investigate the dynamics of dyadic interaction more generally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the same way that wind-chill, a combination of temperature and wind speed has become a commonly used composite of weather information used by many Americans, for Inuit visibility and sea-state are critical factors in whether to travel or stay put. For example, visibility is a product of cloud cover, wind, snow conditions, terrain, and more. The research team will seek to quantify factors and test them through camps for Elders and youth.

If successful, the team plans to share the factors with forecast agencies and others to increase the production of actionable knowledge. <br/><br/>Paragraph 2 <br/>This research will investigate human-relevant environmental variables in close collaboration with an Inuit community in the Eastern Arctic to co-produce knowledge on Arctic weather in order to inform decisions that enable safe, productive travel on land, open sea, and sea-ice required for acquiring food and other cultural purposes. In the research team's work with the community of Clyde River, Nunavut, they have found that synthetic environmental variables (e.g., visibility, blowing snow, wave height) are more important than individual meteorological variables (e.g., air temperature, wind speed). In addition, the work will be expanded and strengthened by working with additional communities in the US and Greenland. In short, Inuit synthesize complex variables representing the natural environment to inform decisions that facilitate their life-way in this environment. The research will be carried out in a setting familiar to Inuit and consistent with Inuit social values and interactions, organized as a series of Elder-youth science camps between Alaska Native and Eastern Arctic Inuit. This approach overlaps with strong community interests in fostering interactions and knowledge transfer among Elders and youth, as well as collaborating with visiting scientists. As Elders consider what to do, they will also be teaching the youth, making explicit many thoughts and considerations that otherwise typically remain implicit. The youth, in turn, will help document this knowledge transfer by keeping journals during the camps about their activities and what they are learning and doing. Participant observation by the research team will give insight into this process, so they can understand how awareness of weather and related factors emerge, and will allow them to create mathematical descriptions of those factors.

Substantial variation between rift zones worldwide indicates that continental breakup is dictated by a complex interplay of tectonic forces and geologic characteristics. Therefore, it is critical to understand the full context for a rifting system, from the highly extended rift center that houses volcanoes and earthquakes to the flanks of the rift, where extension is just beginning and pre-rift structures are still evident. The Main Ethiopian Rift segment of the East Africa rift is perhaps the world's most iconic continental rift. New imaging techniques will be applied to recently acquired seismic data spanning this rift to reveal the 3-D internal structure of this rift and shed light on key geologic processes in this and other rifts around the world. This project involves collaboration with scientists from Ethiopia and provides career opportunities for early career researchers under-represented in the Earth sciences. <br/><br/>Detailed imaging of the internal structure of an entire rift system, from flank to axis, can shed light on the mechanics, controls, and time-dependency of extensional processes in the Main Ethiopian Rift. Recently acquired data from a wide aperture broadband seismic array is critical in sampling pre-rifted structure that may control rift dynamics, as well as to image the geodynamically crucial transitional zone between rift axis and flank.  Our tomographic technique entails simultaneous inversion of P and S receiver functions with Rayleigh wave phase velocities within a Bayesian framework; this approach is ideally suited to capture lithologic/seismic discontinuities, the presence of melt, and complex 3-D rift structure. Anisotropic body wave inversions and splitting studies will help constrain the locus of melt as well as the time-integrated strain history of this rift. This project utilizes seismic data from a number of previous projects in the region, combining the strengths of multiple deployments to achieve a synoptic understanding.  Collaboration with Ethiopian scientists and supporting the early careers of under-represented researchers are among the broader impacts of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neurobehavioral function involves the integrated output and action of the nervous system (i.e., behavior). This project will promote training and learning by involving student researchers (e.g., first-generation, and non-traditional college students) in the project; doing so will help improve STEM education.<br/><br/>Epigenetics, or environment-driven changes in gene activity, is an important mechanism that underlies brain plasticity. However, little is known about how the environment contributes to plasticity of the spinal cord. This project examines developmental and environment-induced epigenetic changes in the spinal cord, as related to motor behavior. It identifies and describes an important mechanism of behavioral development and spinal cord plasticity, which is important for identification of people at-risk for neurobehavioral dysfunction. DNA methylation of the Bdnf (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) gene in the spinal cord will be investigated during postnatal development in rats. Following open-field behavioral testing, DNA methylation in the spinal cord will be measured using bisulfite DNA sequence analysis. The relationship between epigenetic activity in the spinal cord and motor behavior will be examined in developing rats during the postnatal period as well as in response to changes in maternal caregiving. It is expected that spinal cord Bdnf methylation levels will be directly associated with changes in motor behavior. This project will contribute to understanding of basic principles and processes underlying behavioral development and mechanisms of spinal cord plasticity, and determine the extent to which DNA methylation of the Bdnf gene is a mechanism of central nervous system plasticity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This demographic reconfiguration is expected to have widespread impacts. The research supported by this award will investigate one of these impacts:  how the increasing residential proximity of different ethnic groups living in the same neighborhoods affects their social interactions. Investigating this question is complicated by another well-established social trend: decreasing interactions within and between all social groups, not just across ethnic lines.  Therefore, the overarching research question is, ""What does the increase in racial and ethnic diversity in national residential patterns mean as residential social ties among all neighbors, not only across race or ethnicity, become weaker?"" The research is important because neighborhood social cohesion affects both community security and quality of life. Findings from this research will help social scientists, policy makers, and city planners to better understand what supports healthy neighborhoods during periods of widespread social change.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out in a suburban community near Chicago. The researcher chose this site because it is an established, mixed Latino and non-Latino,  middle-class neighborhood, where similarities of class and experience could be expected to facilitate inter-ethnic contacts, if other factors,  such as ethnic sorting and decreasing sociality, were not also at work. Data will be collected through a combination of social science methods, including household surveys of a stratified sample of 128 households, 64 structured interviews, archival research, and on-going participant observation. The surveys and interviews will be applied to an equal number of Latino and non-Latino households. Two adult respondents will be surveyed and interviewed in every household whenever possible with the aim to also detect gender-related variations.

Quantum control of these systems paves the way for new technologies such as quantum communication and quantum computing.  This project will pioneer the use of lanthanum ions as a quantum bit in order to overcome some challenges for quantum communication networks.  In particular, the project seeks to demonstrate an interface between ions and infrared photons. Since infrared light suffers minimal losses in an optical fiber, this approach can extend the size and efficiency of quantum communication networks. Students working on this project will benefit from atomic physics research training using lasers, optics, photonics, and fiber technology.  The project will also develop new curricula incorporating quantum information science and photonics technologies. These activities will help prepare the next generation of STEM researchers, educators, and innovators.<br/><br/>The research aim of this project is to establish doubly-ionized lanthanum as a quantum bit, or qubit, that can be controlled with telecom-compatible infrared light.  Trapped atomic ions are one of the leading platforms for quantum information processing applications due to their long trapping times, good coherence properties, and the availability of methods to precisely control their quantum states using radiation.  However, the established ion trapping experiments use ions from elements that mainly interact with visible and ultraviolet light.  This poses a challenge for quantum networking because these wavelengths get attenuated in optical fibers.  Doubly-ionized lanthanum is unique because telecom-compatible infrared light is all that should be needed for laser cooling and qubit operations. This project will use telecom-compatible infrared light first for Doppler cooling, and then for manipulation of qubits based on magnetic-field-insensitive hyperfine states. This is expected to be advantageous for long-distance quantum communication protocols that use atom-photon entanglement and for distributed quantum computation schemes. Directly interfacing ions with infrared wavelengths will also reduce the complexity of the system, and may thus enhance the potential for scaling up larger quantum networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In diseases like cancer where therapeutic drugs are designed to kill cells, systematic administration of drugs can severely damage healthy cells, leading to undesired side effects in patients undergoing treatment. Nanoliposomes are extremely small lipid capsules that can carry these toxic drugs only to diseased cells without harming healthy cells in the body, minimizing their side effects. These carriers should, however, be carefully tailored to address selected group of cells affected in different diseases while sparing other cells. The goal of this project is to generate a toolbox for design and development of highly tailored nanoliposomes for carrying drugs for a wide range of treatment applications. The impact of this study goes far beyond the fields of biomaterials and drug delivery as it tackles a major challenge in today's medicine, namely selective and efficient drug delivery, impacting the lives of millions of patients with devastating diseases like cancer or neurological disorders. Additionally, by supporting the growth and empowerment of female youth in the diverse Houstonian community, this project will raise the quality of life for this entire community.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/><br/>Among nano-delivery vehicles developed to date, nanoliposomes (NLs) have shown the greatest promise for efficient delivery of bioactive molecules to specific sites in the body and have hence, found applications beyond research laboratories. A particularly attractive aspect of liposomal membranes lies in their ability to mimic the fluid and dynamic nature of biological membranes. This unique feature can be effectively used for dynamic adjustment of membrane surface properties, presenting outstanding opportunities for delivery applications. NLs, however, suffer from the lack of mechanical stability and control over the cargo release. An appealing strategy developed to address these limitations is to add a solid nanoparticle that can provide mechanical stability and controlled release, as a core into NLs. Despite the fast growing interest in such hybrid vehicles for delivery applications, there remains a gap in fundamental understanding of structure-function relationship in these systems, hindering their full potential realization. Particularly, the key differences between these hybrid vehicles and their parental systems including (a) the presence of a stiff core within an otherwise highly deformable NL, and (b) the dynamic display of targeting moieties on a solid NP with an otherwise static surface, and their impact on the performance of these systems have remained unexplored. <br/><br/>This CAREER award by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research, to the University of Houston is to fill the above-mentioned gap and provide an in depth understanding of the unique physiochemical aspects of solid-core liposomes in relation to their functionality and cellular interactions. To this end, a versatile class of targeted liposomal membranes with mechanically tunable polymeric cores will be developed and systematically studied for cell recognition and internalization. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a stimuli-responsive membrane-mimicking vehicle that can simultaneously offer high specificity, high efficiency, mechanical stability, and controlled release for intracellular delivery of bio-active molecules. <br/>This work is potentially transformative as it aims to develop nanomaterials that offer mechanical stability and controlled release along with high selectivity and efficacy for intracellular delivery of theranostics -an unmet need in several medical and biomedical research areas including cancer research and regenerative medicine. In addition, this project is the first study on the structure-function relationship in solid core liposomal membranes -a rapidly growing class of delivery nanomaterials. Moreover, this project will shed light on fundamental yet unexplored aspects of nano-scale biomaterials: (i) the role of core mechanical stiffness in NLs, and (ii) the effect of surface mobility of ligands on targeted NPs, in their cellular interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

REU interns will conduct research in areas of mesoscale and synoptic weather, microclimates, biometeorology, mountain meteorology, modern climate, and paleoclimate to better understand their physical processes, their predictability, and impact on society. The primary objective of the NEPARS REU site is to provide learning opportunities to a promising and diverse group of undergraduates which will help them prepare for careers in STEM fields by conducting quality scientific research, building professional networks, improving leadership skills, and developing effective communication skills.  Each year a cohort of 12 undergraduate students will be offered paid summer research positions with the NEPARS REU to work with faculty mentors from Hobart & William Smith Colleges (HWS) and Plymouth State University (PSU). Six students and three mentors will work at each research location during a 9-week summer research program. Additionally, the NEPARS REU will partner with the Mt. Washington Observatory and the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at SUNY Albany to offer interactions beneficial to REU student professional development. The NEPARS REU site has a primary focus on participation of rising sophomores and rising juniors that have just completed their first and second year, respectively, at two-year or four-year colleges and universities across the U.S. offering degrees in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The REU site will be structured so that students work in pairs with a mentor.  This will allow the students to develop experience working as part of a research team, while they will also learn autonomy of research with their own individual project within the team.  Modern technology, such as video-conferencing, will be leveraged so that students can communicate across the two locations.  The REU site has 4 objectives for students: 1) interact with, learn from, and conduct research investigations with their peers and dedicated mentors through the use of REU pairings and a REU cohort across two research locations, 2) explore and discover the social, cultural, and geographic diversity of others with comparable academic interests from similar or vastly different colleges and universities, 3) cultivate a greater understanding of atmospheric and related sciences beyond the extent taught in the undergraduate classroom and lab, including the development  and enhancement of research skills while working with observational and modeling datasets, and 4) develop effective leadership and communication skills through a series of workshops and opportunities to interact with professionals within the scientific community.  Additionally the REU site has developed two objectives for the REU mentors: 1) increase interactions between two primarily undergraduate institutions to strengthen the respective programs and support new, as well as existing, faculty research collaborations, and 2) enhance faculty development as undergraduate mentors through training, faculty-to-faculty mentoring, and by working with a diverse student population from a variety of academic institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lynn of Emory University and Professor Yi Tang of the University of California at Los Angeles.  The conference, which is international in scope, brings together the most knowledgeable investigators in the field of systems chemistry for in depth discussions of state-of-the-art research and an examination of potential priorities for the future.  The conference is extremely timely, having the capacity to bring definition and direction to a rapidly expanding subject in chemistry.  Systems chemistry is a highly multidisciplinary undertaking that impinges on virtually all aspects of chemistry.<br/><br/>This first Systems Chemistry from Concepts to Conceptions GRC has two primary foci. The first builds on and extends themes that emerged from the NSF-supported workshop on Alternative Chemistries of Life. Specifically, the emergence of function in self-organized multi-component systems, self-replicating systems, design and analysis of functional chemical systems operating far from equilibrium, and chemical evolution of complex systems.  The theory/experiment continuum permeate all sessions and connect the chemistry of life on earth implicitly and explicitly with the emerging opportunities for analyzing the chemistry of supramolecular molecular assemblies. Further, the conference connects the divergent foci that have emerged somewhat independently across the US, UK, and EU by constructing and analyzing the diverse, non-equilibrium molecular networks by researchers in universities, government laboratories, and private research institutes to inform the research community on the limits of dynamic chemical systems. Second, the formal presentations, response questions, discussions at poster sessions, and the casual interactions constitute an opportunity for ideas on new topics and future directions to emerge. Young scholars selected from submitted abstracts and scholars form minority serving institutions are engaged in a with established scientists to achieve greater inclusive excellence. Timely new results from student talks extend the discussions and open possibilities for mentoring. New ideas span and unify the current diversity of involved disciplines.  Representative topics at the conference include: dynamic behaviors of chemical networks, non-equilibrium chemical networks, supramolecular chemistry, and alternative chemistries of life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The measures resulting from this study will facilitate examination of these processes and provide a powerful resource for the scientific research community.  They will be more broadly beneficial as well by allowing policymakers, practitioners, and the public to track neighborhood progress and target improvements.<br/><br/>The project takes advantage of Google Street View imagery?the largest publicly available longitudinal dataset of visual appearance of street blocks?and will use Amazon?s Mechanical Turk? a crowdsourcing platform?and existing field survey data to identify indicators of physical disorder and maintenance, such as trash and blighted buildings, on a sample of street segments across three distinct cities: Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles. These data will be used to train an algorithm that draws on recent advances in machine learning and computer vision. Reliability and validity of the method for identifying characteristics and measures will be tested throughout each step of the process. The resulting longitudinal measures of the physical conditions of neighborhoods will be linked to longitudinal health surveys conducted in each of the three cities to analyze the relationship between physical neighborhood conditions and health.

One particular challenge that has been noted focuses on career pathways.  Graduate students generally are not exposed to the breadth of career pathways that are open to Ph.D. recipients, thereby hampering students from making informed decisions about their educational paths and professional preparation.  Accurate and transparent program and career outcomes data are necessary to enable students to identify and direct their studies toward their desired career goals. This National Science Foundation award to the Association of American Universities (AAU) will support a workshop that will bring together representatives from a number of institutions currently engaged in efforts to document and make publicly available data on doctoral program admission, completion, and career outcome measures; scholars conducting research on doctoral career pathways; and university administrators charged with overseeing graduate education. The goal of the workshop is to survey the existing landscape for understanding doctoral education outcomes, foster synergies among participants, and determine next directions.<br/><br/>The one-and-a-half-day workshop will support discussions among participants regarding methodologies used in data collection, how collected data is intended or not intended to be used, and what efforts can be undertaken to increase communication across existing efforts, standardize approaches, and improve documentation and availability of data on doctoral education and career outcomes. Representatives from a number of major efforts to collect and analyze doctoral educational outcomes data, administrative leaders at doctoral-granting institutions, and leaders of efforts on broadening career pathways for students will be invited to participate. The workshop will include panel presentations and facilitated discussions. Access to reliable, accurate, and transparent data is an essential starting point for discussions that can lead to effective decision making. The immediate goal of this workshop is to determine direct steps that can make such data standardized and available to the community and stakeholders. Ultimately, the expectation is that this will lead to work that will identify and mitigate institutional, cultural, and disciplinary barriers that may prevent doctoral students from identifying, exploring, and preparing for a wide range of career pathways.<br/><br/>This proposal is co-funded by the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) Core Research (ECR) program and the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program.  The ECR program (NSF 15-509) focuses on fundamental research in STEM education by providing funds in critical research areas that are essential, broad and enduring.

Data can be transmitted or received through seawater, earth, or other challenging environments at the rate between 1000 and 10,000 events per second by stationary or rotatory methods. The antennae for such transmission ought to be portable so that they can be carried by first responders. Stationary antennae as simple as a loop of wire are not portable as they require kilometers of real estate. Rotatory antennae employing motor(s) driving permanent magnets suffer from reliability, noise, and service duration associated with moving parts. The proposed concept overcomes these shortcomings by avoiding bulk motion in the synthesis of a centimeter-sized antenna swirling a magnetic cloud. It relies on 'variable material' rather than the 'variable structure' on which mechanical rotation relies. Local first responders will be consulted, and their feedback will be used to identify design constraints. Electrical, civil, and ocean engineering students will learn electromagnetism, power electronics, and hardware validation. <br/><br/>The main objective of the work plan is to reduce the dimensions of an ultra-low-frequency antenna from kilometers to centimeters. The full proposal proves mathematically that such drastic size reduction requires the generation of a rotating magnetic field. The EAGER novelty is to create such rotating magnetic field without using moving parts. Two pieces of hardware will be designed, constructed, and tested: an ultra-low-frequency antenna and a sensitive magnetometer capable of detecting femto-Teslas. The antenna is constructed from two basic cells. Each basic cell comprises a Neodymium magnet serving as a source of magnetic flux, a ferrite yoke serving as a high-permeability conduit of magnetic flux, and a current-controlled saturable inductor serving as a 'shutter' for magnetic flux. The shutter's core is realized by non-oriented 80% nickel-iron alloy or square-loop ferrite that can be saturated with low control current. At zero control current, the shutter's permeability is high. Since the ferrite yoke's permeability is already high, the flux from the magnet is trapped (no emission) by the shutter and the yoke.  As the control current increases, the shutter's permeability decreases to let more flux emit from the magnet. A circular array of basic cells and the associated modulated control currents will generate a spinning magnetic cloud. Simulation of a preliminary design suggests that 100 femto-Teslas at 1000 Hertz would be detected under seawater at 100m away from a two-cell prototype with dimensions of 15 x 9.5 x 3 cubic centimeters. This preliminary design will be refined in the first quarter, and a flux shutter will be constructed. The shutter, ferrite yoke, and permanent magnet will be integrated to realize the antenna in the second quarter. A single-axis induction magnetometer will be designed and tested in the third quarter to measure the expected femto-Teslas at 100 m away. Three-axis magnetometer will be constructed in the fourth quarter to detect the field vector. The power electronics to drive the antenna will be designed and fabricated by the third quarter. The antenna and its driver will be integrated and field-tested in the fourth quarter. The project is deemed successful upon detection of 100 femto-Teslas at 1000 Hertz at 100m distance with an antenna volume less than 450 cubic centimeters, and without moving parts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to characterize the thermal IR emission of Sun's corona, including an investigation of numerous coronal IR emission lines, across a variety of solar structures (coronal holes, plumes, prominences, etc.) on an otherwise almost unexplored physical regime.  The project's primary personnel are two very early-career women (one scientist, one engineer), and additional REU students will be involved -- including for the flight preparations themselves.  The project team is committed to fostering diversity and inclusion while training the next generation of instrumentation scientists and engineers in the U.S.   <br/><br/>The first AIR-Spec flight succeeded in measuring all targeted five infrared (IR) coronal emission lines, including the first-of-its-kind measurement of the coronal Fe IX line at 2.845 microns.

This project will exploit the visual nature of sign languages--where the body parts producing language are highly visible--to determine whether languages change so that they are easier to produce or so that they are easier to understand. In doing so, the project will address fundamental theoretical questions about language change that cannot be addressed by analyzing historical samples of spoken languages. To this end, the researchers will develop computational tools that allow 3D human body poses to be automatically extracted from 2D video. Such tools will be useful for the development of automated sign language recognition, promoting accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, and for developing automated systems for recognizing and classifying human gestures. The research will involve deaf and hard-of-hearing students, helping to increase diversity in the nation's scientific workforce.<br/><br/>It is well documented that sign languages change over time, and it is a commonly held belief that those changes have resulted from successive generations making language easier to perceive. However, most of this evidence has been anecdotal and descriptive and has not quantified changes in the ease of perception and production of ASL over time. The research team will take advantage of the fully visible articulators of sign languages to develop novel pose estimation algorithms that are able to automatically extract information contained in 2D video to create accurate 3D models of articulator movement during language production. The recent birth and rapid evolution of Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL) has allowed researchers to study language change, from the beginning, on a compressed time-scale. By leveraging an existing NSL database - comprised of 2D videos from four generations of Nicaraguan signers - and utilizing these novel pose estimation algorithms, the researchers will be able to empirically assess the extent to which linguistic changes are driven by perceptual constraints imposed by the human visual system and/or articulatory constraints imposed by the musculoskeletal system. The researchers will also query lexical databases of American Sign Language to test predictions about the perceptual form of modern day ASL, and conduct behavioral studies with deaf and hearing users of ASL to test hypotheses regarding the allocation of visual attention as a result of both deafness and acquisition of a sign language. In doing so, the research will provide valuable information about how the human brain changes the tools we use (in this case, language) and the way that those tools in turn shape the function of the human brain. This will provide a more complex understanding of language change that illuminates the complex interaction between languages and the human beings that use them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Documented field evidence revealed damage distribution patterns that have been recognized in published studies of previous earthquakes in the region, specifically that the complex regional and local geology, hydrology and geotechnical conditions play a decisive role in shaping the ground shaking characteristics of the clay sediments in Mexico City.  While ground motion recordings showed clear evidence of one-dimensional (1D) site amplification in the lake zone of the basin, the uneven damage distribution and ground motion variability in areas of reportedly similar deposit depths and structural characteristics in the transition zone suggest that three-dimensional (3D) site effects played a significant role in the observed damage.  The documented evidence of the role of site effects in Mexico City combined with the high density instrumentation and decades of site characterization research provide an excellent opportunity for engineers and earth scientists to study in real scale the coupling of 3D basin effects and 1D local (shallow) site response, and the interaction between hydrological conditions and seismic amplification.   Advances in our understanding of these phenomena can be used to develop better prediction models for seismically active regions, including U.S. metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.  The overarching goal of this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to combine instrumentation and monitoring, ata collection and analysis, and numerical modeling to better characterize regional basin and local site effects during earthquakes.  The rapid response framework maximizes the project resources by aligning its goal with ongoing and upcoming activities of Mexican researchers and engineers to refine the geological and geotechnical site characterization of the basin, and map the evolution of dynamic geotechnical properties with time to the rapidly changing hydrologic conditions in the area.  This award addresses the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. <br/><br/>On a technical level, this project focuses on conducting dynamic site characterization of strong motion stations and other key places in Mexico City using active source and ambient wavefield surface wave methods along with horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios.  The goal of conducting these measurements is to develop seismic shear wave velocity profiles and estimate site periods that can lead to improved microzonation maps for the city and regional hazard assessment.  Combining field measurements with the spatial variability of shallow deposits and geological information of the deeper sediments from Mexican research databases, a 3D shallow crust velocity model of Mexico City will be developed.  This model is essential for physics based ground motion simulations, given the known influence that small-scale lateral heterogeneities in very soft materials have on ground motions, especially in cases of complex resonance interaction between the deeper geologic formations, the shallow sediments, and the structural vibration characteristics of buildings.  A better understanding of these phenomena contributes by extension to improved seismic hazard estimates not only for Mexico City, but also for U.S. cities that lie on similar sedimentary basins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet many important aspects of primate and human biology are linked to variation in soft tissues, such as the degree of fat storage required for development and growth, or the degree of muscle development required for locomotion or within-species competition. In this project, the researchers will investigate the relationships among skeletons, soft-tissues, and reproduction across the lifespan, in the rhesus monkey population of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. The project will advance knowledge about fundamental relationships among form, function, and behavior in non-human primates, which can inform our understanding of past primate and human biology. The project is an important part of research initiatives between New York University (NYU) and the Caribbean Primate Research Center, Puerto Rico, and builds on current initiatives to preserve and curate the Cayo Santiago skeletal collection as a valuable biological data resource. In addition, educational and public access programs will provide many opportunities for underrepresented minority students to participate in STEM research, both in the continental US and in Puerto Rico.<br/>		<br/>The usual absence of soft-tissues from the fossil record presents a big challenge for assessing reproductive life histories from skeletal data in order to estimate the phenotypic variation on which natural selection acted, and to reconstruct the evolution of our species.

Although significant progress has been made during the past decade to better understand the seismic response of wood-frame building systems and identify sustainable seismic retrofit methods, most studies have focused only on the structural system and nonstructural component response. Building interactions with lifeline components (e.g., utility piping systems) and soil-structure interaction during seismic events have not been widely investigated either analytically or experimentally. This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will support a team of researchers from U.S. universities to collaborate with researchers from Japanese universities on experimental seismic studies of wood-frame building systems that will be conducted at the world's largest shake table (E-Defense) in Miki, Japan in early 2019.  The goal of this RAPID project is to collect time-sensitive data and plan payload tests for the experimental studies at the E-Defense shake table on two full-scale, three-story wood-frame buildings as a sub-project of the ""Tokyo Metropolitan Resilience Project"" supported in Japan by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED). The outcomes of this research will include a database, recorded using the advanced technologies of the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Natural Hazards Reconnaissance Facility equipment (https://rapid.designsafe-ci.org/), on the seismic performance of typical wood-frame building systems, the efficiency of sustainable seismic retrofit methods, and the complex soil-structural-nonstructural-lifeline interactions.  The data from these experimental tests can be used to advance computational models for the prediction of building performance, repair times, and post-event functionality rates. The results of this research will also enable decision-makers to better understand the nature of interdependency between the multiple attributes of a residential unit and the efficiency of the various seismic retrofit techniques and will assist in planning and investments to reduce seismic vulnerability. The collected data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported NHERI Data Depot (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/). This project will train a graduate student and promote international collaboration between Japanese and U.S. colleagues working together on enhancing the resilience of wood-frame building systems in urban environments through the established partnership of the NSF-supported NHERI with Japan's NIED. The findings of this project will be disseminated through a public webinar as well as podcasts on the NHERI web site (https://www.designsafe-ci.org).<br/><br/>In this RAPID project, the collaborative Japanese and U.S. research team will investigate the seismic resilience of wood-frame building systems tested at the E-Defense shake table as well as testing various seismic retrofit/repair solutions for enhancing urban community resilience. The design of wood-frame residential construction in Japan is considerably comparable to U.S. residential design.  The objectives of this project are twofold: (1) collect damage and repair/restoration data during the E-Defense tests for different levels of seismic intensity until complete structural collapse, accounting for the interaction of structural and nonstructural components, soil-structure interaction, and lifeline utility performance (both for conventional designs as well as for solutions with seismic retrofits), and (2) identify opportunities for payload projects such as retrofits, various utility systems, and nonstructural components. The collected data will be used to establish a holistic performance of housing recovery based on the assessment of the complex interaction among seismic hazard characteristics, human decision-making processes, building and retrofit attributes, and economic factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The disproportionate rate at which unarmed Black citizens are shot is believed to reflect widespread racial bias on behalf of officers, which erodes public trust and reduces policing effectiveness. Calls to reduce bias with department-wide implicit bias training are common. There is evidence, however, that officers vary widely both in the rate of decision-making errors and in the degree of race bias in these decisions. Moreover, why race impacts decisions -- in terms of how it affects the underlying decision process -- varies across officers. Finally, the effectiveness of implicit bias training has been questioned recently, raising concerns that department-wide implicit bias training may not reduce unarmed shootings. These problems all reflect a larger theoretical problem: that the underlying cognitive and attentional components involved in an officer?s decision to shoot are not well understood. This project advances the basic science of decision making and does so in the context of a decision with great societal import. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to develop an Attention-integrated Model-based Shooting Simulator (AiMSS) to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the decision to shoot. The AiMSS combines computational models of decision making, visual psychophysics and eye-tracking methods, and an immersive decision simulator to map the processes police officers use to decide to shoot. The knowledge gained from AiMSS informs the development of training methods to minimize the impact of race on this decision and will serve as a generative tool to apply to other split-second decisions (e.g., medical decision making, security monitoring decisions). At the conceptual level, this research advances current computational modeling approaches by incorporating them with visual and social processing methods. This integration provides a more comprehensive understanding of this important decision that will ultimately aid in developing individualized interventions. Phase I will deploys a dynamic, immersive shooting simulator and mobile eye-tracking technology to collect behavioral and eye-gaze data during the decision to shoot. Using this rich data, the investigators develop computational models of decision making by integrating gaze behavior, pre-existing beliefs, and affective evaluations into an evidence accumulation process modulated by attention. An important strength of this approach is that both experts (sworn officers) and untrained participants will be tested. Phase II then uses results and methods from Phase I to compare different training interventions that seek to reduce the effect of race on the decision to shoot. The investigators develop the AiMSS to select individuals, identify the decision component responsible for biased responding, and deliver an intervention targeted to that specific component.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The process uses a laser to lift the nanostructure non-destructively and place it with sub-5 nanometer precision on a flexible substrate. The process is affordable because it can be done under ambient conditions. Such a capability is important for applications such as wearables, sensors, and other flexible electronics, the economic manufacture of which advances the prosperity and security of the nation. Additive manufacturing or three-dimensional printing is widely used by engineers and designers for rapid prototyping customizable products. Unfortunately, such a rapid prototyping technique is yet to be developed for the nanoscale and for flexible substrates. The importance of manufacturing at the nanoscale lies in the extraordinary properties that materials exhibit at such small scales. Therefore, the ability to manufacture three-dimensional nanometer-sized structures becomes critically important to explore new properties and applications of nanomaterials. Reliable and cost-effective manufacturing of nanostructures and devices on flexible substrates has become increasingly important for the production of wearable devices with a worldwide market expected to reach USD 50 Billion by 2022. This award supports research on nanoscale three-dimensional printing that can enable rapid prototyping of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional nanostructures on flexible substrates. This award also enables broad participation of women and underrepresented minority students in research and education and STEM training of the next-generation workforce.<br/><br/>The additive nanomanufacturing method in this research overcomes many limitations that commonly exist in conventional nanomanufacturing methods, which are high-cost, time-consuming, incompatibility with flexible substrates, and lack of customization. This research utilizes localized heating from a low-cost continuous-wave laser to lift-off nanostructures of virtually any shape and size. Through precise electrical manipulation, the lifted nanostructures are transfered and additively placed on flexible, conformal or rigid substrates, non-destructively, to form 3D and 3D nanoscale patterns with sub-5nm resolution. The whole manufacturing process happens under ambient conditions without the need of high-voltage or vacuum, which makes it cost-effective. The project involves precise position and temperature measurements to study the fundamental mechanisms for this manufacturing process. The initial speed and angular distribution of the lifted nanostructures are measured quantitatively by using optical forward scattered detection. The localized temperature in the manufacturing process is measured with temperature sensitive luminescent probes. Selective and compatible nanomanufacturing of complementary, 2D and 3D nanostructures, with high precision nano-scale gaps on flexible substrates are demonstrated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to bacteria, which have a simple one-to-one relationship between gene and product, in complex organisms, gene expression requires large-scale rearrangements that add, remove and combine information.  Such ""RNA splicing"" is ubiquitous and remarkably diverse across all complex life, yet it remains almost completely mysterious outside of very few model organisms.  The project will develop bioinformatic software to leverage available biological sequence data from hundreds of diverse species to: discover millions of cases of splicing; identify the general form and function of splicing in each species; and illuminate the molecular processes by which splicing occurs.   By advancing understanding of the outputs and processes of gene expression, this project will elucidate how organisms function, from ourselves to countless crops, parasites, pests, and commensal organisms.  In addition, the project will advance training of a diverse and skilled workforce by training graduate, undergraduate and community college students in biological and computational sciences at one of our nation's most diverse comprehensive universities.  Finally, the proposed work will support curricular innovation by integrating cutting-edge bioinformatics research into classroom teaching in multiple undergraduate courses.<br/><br/>Arguably the most striking feature of eukaryotic nuclear gene expression is the ubiquity of RNA processing by the spliceosome, with most protein-coding transcripts undergoing splicing in the vast majority of characterized eukaryotic lineages.  Spliceosomes remove ubiquitous gene-interrupting sequences called introns, can facilitate the production of multiple products from the same gene by alternative splicing, and can produce novel products by splicing together of transcripts from different regions of the genome.  Despite the importance of splicing, almost nothing is known about splicing outside of a small number of model organisms.  This project will develop bioinformatic pipelines to leverage available genomic and transcriptomic data from 300 diverse eukaryotic species to advance knowledge of splicing across the eukaryotic domain.  Specifically, this project will advance understanding of form, function, mechanism and evolution of splicing by accomplishing three objectives: (i) the first domain-wide genome-wide characterization of eukaryotic cis- and trans- splicing events; (ii) the first domain-wide multi-level study of alternative splicing and trans-splicing; and (iii) the first domain-wide characterization and comparison of cis- and trans- factors involved in the mechanism of splicing.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences , the Division of Evolutionary Biology, and the Rules of Life Venture fund.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2000, the U.S. Census began allowing individuals to indicate more than one race. From 2000 to 2010 alone, such responses increased by 32%, to 9 million. Yet, research suggests that the American multiracial population has grown much faster than the public's ability to perceive individuals as multiracial. For example, a person identifying as both African American and Caucasian will tend to be seen by others as African American only. One explanation is that people have not yet added a concept of multiracialism to the monoracial categories that are woven into the American social fabric. This disconnect between the real and assumed racial identity of a large and rapidly growing segment of the American population carries adverse impacts that have been well-documented by researchers. This project investigates how human minds process and racially categorize the faces of multiracial individuals. It also examines how experiences shape the capacity to view people as multiracial. A better understanding of the cognitive and social influences on the perception of multiracial individuals can be used to help reduce stereotyping, contribute to a more positive identity formation, and foster more harmonious interpersonal relationships.<br/><br/>This project first seeks to establish a set of ""best practices"" for experimentation using multiracial faces. One set of experiments examines differences in how people judge real versus computer-generated multiracial faces. These studies also consider how the categorization of multiracial faces is affected by the range of presented race options. Statistical modeling techniques are used to determine the precise features of a face that lead others to perceive it as multiracial and to create a set of multiracial faces that can be used by other researchers. The second aim of the project is to determine whether multiracial faces constitute a unique category in the minds of perceivers, or if they are perceptually similar to members of a dominant monoracial category. The third aim is to test whether certain personal attributes or life experiences are associated with a higher likelihood of perceiving multiracialism in others.

There has been long-standing concern about disparity in these most consequential decisions, most prominently, disparity based on the race/ethnicity and gender of defendants and victims.  In addition, differences in case outcomes related to legal representation raise issues of adequate and fair representation for indigent defendants.  Variation between locales in punishment outcomes are also central to a major recent direction of social science research; how discretion in the criminal justice system is shaped by larger socio-political environments.  This proposed research presents a unique opportunity to delve deeper into these important theoretical and criminal justice policy concerns.  This study's findings would be of interest across several disciplines, especially criminology/criminal justice studies, sociology, and legal studies.  For cases charged with first, second, or third degree murder, this proposed project will examine:  1) patterns of disparity in charging, conviction, and punishment outcomes related to defendant and victim race/ethnicity, victim gender and age, and type of defense representation; 2) between-county differences in murder case outcomes and patterns of disparity in relation to court sociopolitical contexts; and 3) qualitative differences between counties in their formal and informal norms shaping murder case processing, focusing on charging and plea bargaining, prosecutorial decisions to seek the death penalty and to retract the death penalty if sought, and sentencing decisions.<br/><br/>The project will compile statistical data from court and prosecutor files on cases charged with first, second, and third-degree murder in 18 Pennsylvania counties that account for 79% of the criminal homicide charges from 2000-2010.  These data will be used to examine individual-level differences in murder case processing outcomes, and between-county differences in murder case outcomes relative to court sociopolitical contextual features.  Analyses will focus on the following dependent variables:  charging decisions, mode of conviction (conviction or not, and conviction by guilty plea or trial), and sentence.  For first degree murder charges, analyses will examine whether prosecutors seek the death penalty and whether they retract that filing, and whether defendants receive the death penalty.  Three classes of statistical models will be estimated:  1) propensity score weighting and/or matching models to examine individual-level differences between groupings of defendants; 2) inverse propensity score weighted regression (IPSWR) models to examine between-county differences in individual-level outcomes on the dependent variables above; and 3) hierarchical logistic and linear models to examine the effects of county contextual variables on the dependent variables.  In addition, open-ended, in-depth interview data will be collected to examine qualitative differences between counties in their formal and informal norms, policies, and practices shaping their murder charging, conviction processes (especially plea bargaining), prosecutorial decisions to seek the death penalty and to retract the death penalty if it is sought, and sentencing decisions.  Forty to fifty individuals will be interviewed in the five counties with the most criminal homicide cases; interviews will include judges, prosecutors, public defenders, and private defense attorneys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, however, there have been no economical ways to extract this clean 'blue' energy from natural salt gradients. This is largely due to the poor efficiencies and high cost of existing membrane technologies. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Research with Industry (GOALI) collaborative award supports fundamental research on a new approach to manufacturing membranes for efficient energy conversion from salinity gradients, using boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNT) as uniquely smooth, highly charged nanoscale pores. The new nanomanufacturing process enables fabrication of energy-harvesting BNNT membranes with power densities ten to 100 times greater than existing membranes, in an efficient and cost-effective manner that can be scaled up to high production rates and large-scale membranes many meter-square in size.  The knowledge base and nanomanufacturing methods that are developed enable renewable energy generation from an under-utilized and non-intermittent power source, and are also generally applicable to the design and manufacture of the specialized membranes that are critical to many industrial processes.  This GOALI collaborative research, between an industrial partner, Chasm Technologies, and Chemical and Mechanical Engineers at two universities, helps students develop multidisciplinary skills and gain industry-relevant experience.  Concerted outreach efforts to spark interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics among women and under-represented minority students enhances diversity and help fill US workforce needs. <br/><br/>The GOALI collaborative research project devises the first scalable, roll-to-roll-compatible method for producing vertically aligned boron-nitride nanotube (BNNT) membranes. This is achieved with a solution-based approach that deposits and aligns oligomer-dispersed BNNTs under the influence of an external electric field, and locks the nanostructure in position by in situ polymerization. The project develops a fundamental understanding and methods for solution-based fabrication at lab scales, targeting 1-10 cm2 membranes with pore densities of 108 - 1010 BNNTs/cm2. The availability of such membranes provides answers to basic questions regarding ion and liquid transport in highly charged nanoscale pores, the implications for molecular separations and electrokinetic energy conversion. The academic collaborators are planning to work with industry partner Chasm Technologies to develop the subsystems and processing steps (e.g., coating, electrokinetic alignment, curing, and post processing) to enable roll-to-roll manufacturing of large-area BNNT membranes. Together, the team studies scalability of the manufacturing process, membrane yield and performance as the size is increased to 100 cm2 and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When software engineers build software they use variable names and comments to embed domain concepts and to communicate with other software engineers. Thus, the quality of those names and comments, i.e., the software lexicon, is of paramount importance for understanding what the software does and how it does it. Researchers have previously identified a set of practices that lead to poor quality lexicon. The speculation is that such practices will possibly impair software understanding and might cause misunderstandings and eventually software bugs. However, there is no objective evidence to support this apparent causal relationship. Thus, this project seeks to characterize the impact of the quality of the lexicon on software understanding by measuring the change of cognitive load when software developers are trying to understand software that contains poor lexicon. The proposed research is expected to contribute in-depth understanding of the so far speculated impact of software lexicon on cognitive workload during program comprehension. A better understanding of how poor lexicon can affect software understanding will, ultimately, positively impact developers' productivity, the cost of software development and maintenance, and the quality of the software. The outcomes of this research will also have a significant positive impact on STEM education as the project will allow us to provide guidelines for students how to write software lexicon that minimizes the cognitive load during program comprehension.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is to characterize the impact of the quality of the lexicon on program comprehension and on software maintenance. The central hypothesis is that a low-quality lexicon correlates both with high cognitive load of developers while understanding source code and with poor software maintenance. To this end we will:<br/>1. Identify direct and objective measures to quantify the impact of lexicon quality on developers' cognitive load. The working hypothesis here is that physiological measures, known to relate to cognitive load, will correlate with self-reported difficulty/inability to understand the software lexicon.<br/>2. Identify which of the practices that are documented in the literature to lead to low-quality lexicon are associated with high cognitive load. The working hypothesis is that certain types of poor lexicon, such as the inconsistency of the lexicon with the source code functionality, will have a significantly higher impact on program comprehension compared to other types of poor lexicon.<br/>3. Identify types of poor quality lexicon that hinder program comprehension during software maintenance tasks. The investigator hypothesizes that the presence of certain types of poor lexicon will significantly increase the time needed to understand a piece of code and in some cases, it will lead to failure while performing software maintenance tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advances in HPC are vital to national interests by providing infrastructure for scientific discovery that improves the national health, prosperity, welfare, and defense. To solve large-scale scientific problems, HPC relies on an increasing number of nodes and components, which makes it likelier for long-running computation to be interrupted with failures before completing. A critical technique to ensure computation completion is checkpointing. Checkpointing allows snapshots of the computation to be saved so that when a failure occurs, computation state can be restored from the last snapshot and continues execution, rather than restarting from the beginning. The research in this project seeks to advance the state-of-the-art checkpointing technique by making it significantly faster and lowering its cost. This project also plans to contribute to the training of future workforce by providing students with exposure to the mechanisms and inefficiencies of current checkpointing mechanisms on NVMM, and the new in-place checkpointing. The project seeks to increase participation of minority and under-represented groups and involves undergraduates in research.<br/><br/>Prior approaches to checkpointing rely on taking a snapshot of the system state (system-level checkpointing) or the application state (application-level checkpointing) and saving it to secondary non-volatile storage. With the advent of non-volatile main memory (NVMM), a new approach to checkpointing becomes possible.  In contrast to traditional approaches to checkpointing that rely on storing separate snapshots in a separate secondary storage, the project uses a new approach where checkpoints can be constructed in-place in the NVMM  utilizing the working data structures used by the applications. This allows only very minimal additional state beyond what the program already saves to memory, making checkpointing significantly faster and incurring lower cost, in turn providing further HPC scaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Long Island Mathematics and Teacher Education (MaTE) Scholarship Program is a Track 1 NSF Noyce Scholarships and Stipends project.  It involves a collaboration between Long Island University Post (LIU Post), the Glen Cove and South Huntington public school districts, and Suffolk County Community College. The MaTE program aims to prepare scholarship recipients to become highly-qualified secondary mathematics teachers in diverse suburban high-need school districts on Long Island. Although many programs focus on providing diverse teaching corps to urban schools, population shifts to the suburbs also require consideration of teacher diversity. Based on the 2010 census, minorities constituted 35 percent of all people living in suburbs, and the outward migration of minority populations from the inner city to suburbia keeps growing. The MaTE program seeks to respond to these issues by providing approximately 24 Noyce Scholars with mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge needed to work effectively in high-need secondary schools. The program emphasizes culturally responsive pedagogy.  The MaTE Program aims to guide three cohorts of Scholars, beginning in their initial years in community college and extending through their junior and senior years at LIU Post.  During their tenure at LIU, each Scholar will receive two years of scholarship support, as well as additional supports such as mentoring. <br/><br/>This educational experience includes an intensive clinical residency in secondary schools within the Glen Cove and South Huntington school districts, both of which are in suburban communities with large minority populations.  It will culminate in a B.A. Mathematics degree with a New York State initial teaching certification in secondary mathematics education (Grades 7-12). The program includes a summer Calculus Enrichment Program, organized and operated by Suffolk County Community College, intended to aid community college students in their mathematics courses and serve as a recruitment tool for the MaTE program.  Collected project data will inform participants, professors of mathematics and mathematics education, and community school districts of evidence-based results related to the following program goals: (1) Providing a replicable model for a successful collaboration between university mathematics faculty, university education faculty, community college faculty and staff, and teachers in local high-need school districts; (2) Connecting content knowledge and best practices to develop a better prepared and more effective new teachers; (3) Increasing and diversifying the corps of local STEM teachers by recruiting students from underrepresented populations in STEM who may, in turn, serve as role models to students from similar backgrounds; and 4) Improving the performance of minority students in secondary schools and reduce the gap between majority and minority students by providing highly trained teachers from similar backgrounds.  It is anticipated that evidence-based findings and the addition of 24 mathematics teachers to regional high-need school districts will make important contributions to ongoing national efforts to produce teachers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organisms can respond by either killing invading pathogens ('resistance') or by reducing the damage caused by pathogens ('tolerance'). Among animals, resistance has been well studied, but relatively little is known about the causes and consequences of tolerance. This project focuses on a bacterial disease that emerged in the mid-1990s in a common backyard songbird, the house finch, causing rapid population declines.  This infection causes severe tissue damage, in the form of conjunctivitis (pink-eye). 'Tolerance' is likely an important way to mitigate this harmful infection. Because the disease reached parts of the house finch range at distinct times, the proposed work uses comparisons among geographically separated finch populations to uncover 1) how quickly 'tolerance' evolves in response to a novel pathogen, 2) the gene expression mechanisms important for tolerance, and 3) the consequences of 'tolerance' for disease spread within flocks. This project also crafts innovative means to communicate its scientific findings with the public. The researchers have joined a global network of science enthusiasts by founding a program that hosts monthly public events where short presentations by scientists or other experts are separated by musical or artistic interludes. Multiple events will feature results from this project. In addition, through a graduate-level course at Virginia Tech this project will train young scientists and educators to design their own programs that enhance public engagement with science.<br/><br/>Infectious diseases are among the most powerful and pervasive selective forces on the planet. Because vigorous resistance mechanisms, such as inflammatory immune responses in vertebrates, can reduce host fitness by damaging an animal's own tissues, selection should favor some degree of tolerance of infection across diverse hosts. To date, however, work on animals has focused almost exclusively on resistance.  By combining molecular techniques and inter-population comparisons, this project directly advances our knowledge of three of the most critical, open issues in the study of animal tolerance: how selection shapes this host strategy following disease emergence, the immune mechanisms underlying tolerance, and the consequences of host tolerance for pathogen transmission. The work utilizes a number of techniques to assess immune responses rarely tested in non-model organisms (e.g., expression of songbird cytokine genes through qPCR and expression of myriad other host genes through RNA-seq). In addition, this project uses experimental epidemics to link differences in individual host responses with pathogen transmission dynamics. Through this combination of comparative, molecular, and experimental techniques, this project integrates the concept of tolerance across levels of biological organization, linking the causes and consequences of this defense strategy from molecules to populations, all in a naturally occurring host-pathogen system. Ultimately, this work will significantly advance knowledge of how tolerance of infection arises in animals and how this host response impacts the dynamics of pathogen epidemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will exploit the visual nature of sign languages--where the body parts producing language are highly visible--to determine whether languages change so that they are easier to produce or so that they are easier to understand. In doing so, the project will address fundamental theoretical questions about language change that cannot be addressed by analyzing historical samples of spoken languages. To this end, the researchers will develop computational tools that allow 3D human body poses to be automatically extracted from 2D video. Such tools will be useful for the development of automated sign language recognition, promoting accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, and for developing automated systems for recognizing and classifying human gestures. The research will involve deaf and hard-of-hearing students, helping to increase diversity in the nation's scientific workforce.<br/><br/>It is well documented that sign languages change over time, and it is a commonly held belief that those changes have resulted from successive generations making language easier to perceive. However, most of this evidence has been anecdotal and descriptive and has not quantified changes in the ease of perception and production of ASL over time. The research team will take advantage of the fully visible articulators of sign languages to develop novel pose estimation algorithms that are able to automatically extract information contained in 2D video to create accurate 3D models of articulator movement during language production. The recent birth and rapid evolution of Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL) has allowed researchers to study language change, from the beginning, on a compressed time-scale. By leveraging an existing NSL database - comprised of 2D videos from four generations of Nicaraguan signers - and utilizing these novel pose estimation algorithms, the researchers will be able to empirically assess the extent to which linguistic changes are driven by perceptual constraints imposed by the human visual system and/or articulatory constraints imposed by the musculoskeletal system. The researchers will also query lexical databases of American Sign Language to test predictions about the perceptual form of modern day ASL, and conduct behavioral studies with deaf and hearing users of ASL to test hypotheses regarding the allocation of visual attention as a result of both deafness and acquisition of a sign language. In doing so, the research will provide valuable information about how the human brain changes the tools we use (in this case, language) and the way that those tools in turn shape the function of the human brain. This will provide a more complex understanding of language change that illuminates the complex interaction between languages and the human beings that use them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They will be more broadly beneficial as well by allowing policymakers, practitioners, and the public to track neighborhood progress and target improvements.<br/><br/>The project takes advantage of Google Street View imagery--the largest publicly available longitudinal dataset of visual appearance of street blocks--and will use Amazon's Mechanical Turk--a crowdsourcing platform--and existing field survey data to identify indicators of physical disorder and maintenance, such as trash and blighted buildings, on a sample of street segments across three distinct cities: Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles. These data will be used to train an algorithm that draws on recent advances in machine learning and computer vision. Reliability and validity of the method for identifying characteristics and measures will be tested throughout each step of the process. The resulting longitudinal measures of the physical conditions of neighborhoods will be linked to longitudinal health surveys conducted in each of the three cities to analyze the relationship between physical neighborhood conditions and health. In addition, the new measures will be released as a publicly available database of longitudinal measures of physical neighborhood conditions across multiple cities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some plant species, transformation is a routine procedure; however, several key crop plants, including corn (maize), are very difficult to transform, and success is limited to only a few varieties, severely limiting the study of gene function and use of the most cutting-edge, genome editing technologies. New, accessible, inexpensive methods to transform plants are needed to advance research and accelerate crop improvement. This project utilizes simple magnets and DNA-carrying particles to introduce engineered DNA into maize pollen, which is easily collected, and then uses the transformed pollen to transmit introduced DNA to the next generation progeny, the seed. Success of this method would revolutionize maize research, allowing rapid and inexpensive modification of any genetic stock by most labs, opening the door to one-step, precise genome editing. Expanding this method to other species would speed up progress in understanding plant genome functions in general and translation of that understanding into improved commercial breeding lines. The project will also help train graduate and undergraduate students in maize genetics, genomics and cell biology.<br/> <br/>The goal of this EAGER project is to develop magnetofection of maize pollen as a simple and rapid method for transformation.  Magnetofection, which uses magnetic force to propel DNA-carrying nanoparticles into a cell, is a relatively new (and inexpensive) technology that has recently been proved effective in the pollen of several plant species, most notably cotton.  However, the structure, development and physiology of maize pollen appears likely to introduce significant hurdles for implementing magnetofection. The project will utilize the relevant expertise of two maize research groups to overcome these hurdles, and to characterize the outcome of transformation via pollen magnetofection on a genome-wide scale.  The experimental plan incorporates three objectives that are calibrated to address the specific barriers to success identified in maize pollen.  Aim 1 will, in parallel, optimize transient magnetofection of maize pollen in vitro, and determine the effects of such treatments on pollen fecundity (i.e., ability to produce seeds).  Aim 2 will use the results from Aim 1 to guide implementation of a stable transformation protocol.  Aim 3 will use standard genetic methods alongside next-gen sequencing to characterize transgene heritability and genome-wide structure in stable transformants.  Any successful transformation protocol would be validated in both labs, and thereafter rapidly released to the maize community via preprint server.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sediments laid down 100-125 million years ago in these areas produce many exceptionally well-preserved fossils that capture the biodiversity of Asia at the very beginning of the rise of flowering plants. Many seed-bearing plants during this time were close relatives of flowering plants yet later became extinct for reasons that are not well understood. Documenting these extinct seed-bearing plants will allow scientists to more fully understand the ecology of this ancient environment and the evolution of seed plants, including flowering plants that form the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems today. Researchers will unearth and describe seed plants preserved as compressed as well as three-dimensional fossils from multiple field sites. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of groups that are under-represented in science, and support the professional development of an early-career researcher. Researchers will educate the public about the Mongolian fossils by authoring a book of popular science non-fiction intended for wide audiences. Their outreach activities will build on popular interest in dinosaurs and will include materials and exhibits produced through the Chicago Botanic Garden. Project personnel will use next-generation science standards to engage middle-school students via an online, bilingual illustrated series about paleontology and earth science. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to a deeper understanding of a critical ecological transition period in the history of life. Research will add significantly to existing knowledge about seed plant diversity during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous in Asia and the global distributions of these species. Researchers will uncover numerous fossil fragments of species, which will allow unprecedented opportunity to reassemble whole plants and compare different developmental stages. Researchers will analyze the morphology and anatomy of these fossils using scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution X-ray microtomography. Newly excavated and existing fossil specimens are expected to yield species new to science and as well as new insights about previously described species. Outcomes of this project will include improved understanding of ancient ecosystems, the historical biogeography of extinct seed plants across continents, and the homology of pollen- and seed-bearing organs among living and extinct seed plants, including flowering plants.

One source of uncertainty is based on the fact that most of human communication is nonverbal.  As a result, people are faced with the task of understanding nonverbal signals that could be interpreted in a variety of ways.  As one example, a silent pause in conversation can communicate discomfort, anger, contentment, thoughtfulness, or empathy. Depending on the context (a job interview, a first date, meeting with a teacher, or a medical exam), one's ability to resolve such uncertainty can have profound consequences. Responses to uncertainty can also reveal important individual differences in emotion processing and coping strategies, and deficiencies in these skills can have widespread effects on mental and social functioning. The practical and financial costs to society, education, and employment are far-reaching.  Yet, very little is known about the processes that allow us to cope with and respond to uncertainty. This CAREER project considers the ways in which different people respond to these situations of extreme uncertainty.  In comparison to younger adults, older adults are more likely to be optimistic and to have more positive interpretations of uncertainty.  By integrating social psychology with developmental science, cognitive neuroscience and network sciences, this project seeks to better understand responses to uncertainty throughout development. It focuses on how these situations are interpreted and on how brain function and connectivity may promote a certain response. The negative thoughts and feelings some individuals experience in response to uncertainty can have deleterious outcomes on health, work performance, and relationships. This project lays the foundation for developing interventions to disrupt these maladaptive processes in favor of more productive responses.<br/><br/>In this CAREER project, brain function and brain connectivity are measured in younger adults to characterize the source of individual differences in valence bias, or the extent to which someone interprets uncertainty as having a positive or negative emotional meaning.  Network analytic tools are applied to establish a link between the basic functional organization of the brain and valence bias, and to provide information about variability in brain function as it relates to the bias. Because older adults have a natural bias to interpret ambiguous cues as positive, this research examines the same brain function and connectivity measures in older adults to determine the mechanisms underlying this enhanced positivity.  The long-term goal is to explore the brain mechanisms that can explain what makes one person experience a positive emotion when another person, in response to the same event, experiences a negative emotion.  The research considers how people can learn to ""do it better"" to increase well-being and resilience in response to potential threats.  The findings will shed light on how individuals with a more optimistic view learn, over time, to override a fundamental default negativity and instead resolve uncertainty in a positive light.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low-rise buildings, in particular, historically have been among the structures that are the most vulnerable to tornado damage. Failures of this type of structure are often responsible for the social and economic losses caused by tornadoes, including the loss of life and property, as well as the interruptions to many critical societal functions. The goal of this collaborative research at the University of Arkansas (UARK) and Texas Tech University (TTU) is to further advance the fundamental understanding of tornadic loading on low-rise buildings. The outcomes of this research can be used for the assessment of building performance in tornadoes, the design of new tornado-resistant buildings, and the development of retrofitting strategies to improve the performance of existing buildings in tornadoes. The research project will be integrated with educational and outreach activities at both UARK and TTU to raise public awareness of the impact of natural hazards, including tornadoes, on the built environment and society in general. At UARK, students will be involved in the research through the Freshman Engineering Program, and the George Washington Carver Research Program that provides research internships to students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. At TTU, the project will provide research training for students in the Wind Science and Engineering Ph.D. program.  The research will also be incorporated with programs such as the Severe Weather Awareness Day in Lubbock, TX, and through partnerships with local K-12 schools and national organizations, such as the 4-H Youth Development and Mentoring Program, to reach out to both local and national communities. These research, educational and outreach activities will help make U.S. communities more resilient to tornado hazards.<br/><br/>To achieve the research goal, this project will utilize a research approach that combines the complementary strengths of physical experiments in a tornado simulator at TTU and numerical modeling based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at UARK. Unlike previous experimental and numerical studies that were conducted independently, the experiments and computational modeling in this research will be systematically coordinated. Customized experiments in the tornado simulator will first serve as the basis to validate and improve the capability of the computational model in simulating near-ground tornado-like flows and in capturing the interaction between these flows and generic structural shapes. The validated computational model and additional experiments in the tornado simulator will then be used to evaluate tornado-induced forces and pressures on low-rise buildings of various envelope configurations. Tornadoes of various structures, in terms of the swirl ratios and the maximum mean tangential velocity to translation velocity ratio, will be considered. The primary outcomes of this study will be in the form of pressure and force coefficients acting on different building shapes. These coefficients, as well as the raw data and the metadata, will be archived at both UARK and TTU and made available to the natural hazards engineering community through the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Data Depot (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These die-off events have altered forest and woodland ecosystems. This includes changes in water and energy fluxes and losses in ecosystem services in many areas. The ability to predict how forests will respond to drought is key for applying rapid land management actions to mitigate undesired outcomes. One goal of this research is to improve mortality predictions for pi?on pine (Pinus edulis) in response to drought. This will be achieved through a watering experiment and a regional survey during an emerging snow drought in the US Southwest. Multiple predictions of pi?on mortality in response to drought have already been developed. Another goal of this research is to use near-term ecological forecasting to test these different predictions. Throughout the drought, forecasts of the likelihood of tree mortality based on these different predictions will be done at intervals of 1 week to 1 year. This project will engage the public, land managers, and scientists through a website that is updated weekly with tree mortality forecasts. This project will develop and implement a teaching module to enhance undergraduate curricula and provide education training for a postdoctoral researcher.  <br/><br/>An emerging frontier of ecosystem science in the face of environmental change is to predict not just ecological responses to trends but to predict extreme ecological events to extreme climate events. Among the most important and extensive of such events is tree die-off in response to drought, warming and associated pests and pathogens. Although much research has focused simply on what exceeds thresholds for tree mortality, yielding numerous potential predictive relationships, none of these relationships have been tested with near-term ecological forecasting. Further, field experiments that have attempted to impose drought largely have been ineffective at improving predictions or testing near-term forecasts due to the challenges of effectively mimicking a severe drought or simultaneous mortality of treated and controls plots. There is thus a critical need for an experiment that takes advantage of a developing extreme drought to test multiple alternate hypotheses in a near-term ecological forecasting context. This project will rapidly implement experimental and monitoring measurements concurrent with the severe snow drought emerging across the southwestern US to test multiple predictions of tree mortality for pi?on pine (Pinus edulis), the most intensively studied tree species for drought-induced mortality. Near-term ecological forecasting will be updated at intervals of 1 week to 1 year throughout the drought, based on the frequency of available input data. Through improved mortality predictions and advancements in near-term ecological forecasting that can encompass extreme ecological events, this research will be a critical step towards developing forecasts that provide the information needed for rapid land management actions and account for longer-term implications such as carbon management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Video streaming, for example, involves numerous systems that control everything from the resolution of the video to the network path and the video download speed based on dynamic network conditions. As networks and applications have become more complex, existing approaches have become inadequate and designing algorithms that deliver high performance in all conditions has become exceedingly difficult. The goal of this research is to address this challenge by developing network systems that learn to manage resources automatically through experience by applying new machine learning techniques. This new paradigm, if successful, will make networks simpler to design, more efficient and cost effective, and able to deliver better services to businesses and consumers. <br/><br/>This project's goal is to develop the algorithmic and systems foundations for designing resource management systems that use modern reinforcement learning and other predictive control techniques to achieve strong performance across heterogeneous networks and applications.

Otherwise, precautionary principles of risk management may limit the ability of society to exploit the potential benefits of engineered nanomaterials. The goal of project is to confirm whether the commercial copper nanoparticle-containing microbicide products used by vegetable and fruit growers influence the diversity and fertility of the soil microbial communities over short and long term.  The principal investigator anticipates that successful completion of this research will not only impact the sub-discipline known as nano-ecotoxicology, but also add to the pool of knowledge in the areas of environmental science, molecular biology, agricultural science, and microbiology.  Direct intellectual merit includes providing scientific answers to the basic question concerning the environmental fate and impact of commercial products containing nanoparticles.  This research will further scientific understanding of how soil properties affect the fate and impact of nanoparticles.  The research will also have a huge impact on the educational training provided to undergraduate students not only at West Chester University, but also throughout the country.  In collaboration with Illumina Inc. and Southern University of New Orleans, the principal investigator plans to develop an open-source seven laboratory teaching module to allow institutions around the world to incorporate state-of-the art hands-on teaching in the area of molecular biology.  In addition, four undergraduate students who are interested in learning environmental biology will be trained.  The research would also involve training six high school students by involving them in minor research activities.

The overall goal of the research is to understand the transformation of nanoparticles over time in soil and elucidate whether transformation has any impact on the microbial community.  Methodology includes obtaining five different agricultural soil types and setting up a total of 464 microcosms.  Experimental sets with periodic dosage of nanoparticles will be maintained in an environmental chamber and sampled at regular intervals over a 30-month incubation period.  Positive and negative controls will also be set up.  Microbial community changes will be monitored using Next Gen Sequencing. Nanoparticle transformation will be followed using X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy.  Changes in soil properties will be followed using standard protocols.  By analyzing the data and integrating the results, the PI will test the following three hypotheses.  Hypothesis 1:  Irrespective of soil properties and product type, a certain fraction of Cu nanoparticles will be retained on the soil surface even after 2 ? years of incubation, while transformation products and any ionic form of Cu present in the products will leach out of the soil.  Hypothesis 2:  While certain sensitive microbes will show changes with a single dose, the community as a whole will resist changes until a critical dose is reached.  Beyond the critical dose, the community will collapse and show large changes.  Also, the bacterial communities will be more susceptible then the fungal or archaea communities. Hypothesis 3: When exposed to nanoparticles, sensitive populations of bacteria will perish.  Other microorganisms will fill the vacant niche, making it harder for sensitive populations to rebound.  The proposed research will provide scientific answers to the basic question on the environmental fate and impact of commercial products containing nanoparticles under different soil properties and conditions.  This research will also further scientific understanding of how soil properties affect the fate and impact of nanoparticles.  In addition, evaluation of the data on how the microbial community responds to nanoparticles will provide valuable information on how the microbial community structure function relationship changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low-rise buildings, in particular, historically have been among the structures that are the most vulnerable to tornado damage. Failures of this type of structure are often responsible for the social and economic losses caused by tornadoes, including the loss of life and property, as well as the interruptions to many critical societal functions. The goal of this collaborative research at the University of Arkansas (UARK) and Texas Tech University (TTU) is to further advance the fundamental understanding of tornadic loading on low-rise buildings. The outcomes of this research can be used for the assessment of building performance in tornadoes, the design of new tornado-resistant buildings, and the development of retrofitting strategies to improve the performance of existing buildings in tornadoes. The research project will be integrated with educational and outreach activities at both UARK and TTU to raise public awareness of the impact of natural hazards, including tornadoes, on the built environment and society in general. At UARK, students will be involved in the research through the Freshman Engineering Program, and the George Washington Carver Research Program that provides research internships to students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. At TTU, the project will provide research training for students in the Wind Science and Engineering Ph.D. program.  The research will also be incorporated with programs such as the Severe Weather Awareness Day in Lubbock, TX, and through partnerships with local K-12 schools and national organizations, such as the 4-H Youth Development and Mentoring Program, to reach out to both local and national communities. These research, educational and outreach activities will help make U.S. communities more resilient to tornado hazards.<br/><br/>To achieve the research goal, this project will utilize a research approach that combines the complementary strengths of physical experiments in a tornado simulator at TTU and numerical modeling based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at UARK. Unlike previous experimental and numerical studies that were conducted independently, the experiments and computational modeling in this research will be systematically coordinated. Customized experiments in the tornado simulator will first serve as the basis to validate and improve the capability of the computational model in simulating near-ground tornado-like flows and in capturing the interaction between these flows and generic structural shapes. The validated computational model and additional experiments in the tornado simulator will then be used to evaluate tornado-induced forces and pressures on low-rise buildings of various envelope configurations. Tornadoes of various structures, in terms of the swirl ratios and the maximum mean tangential velocity to translation velocity ratio, will be considered. The primary outcomes of this study will be in the form of pressure and force coefficients acting on different building shapes. These coefficients, as well as the raw data and the metadata, will be archived at both UARK and TTU and made available to the natural hazards engineering community through the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Data Depot (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is an important challenge to develop statistical methods for extracting useful insights from datasets exhibiting heterogeneity, without making strong modeling assumptions that could restrict the applicability of these methods. One efficient way of doing this is to model the quantiles of an outcome variable conditional on covariates, a method referred to as quantile regression. The current project develops novel statistical methods and computational techniques for quantile regression models when some of the observations are only partially observed. The proposed research will enable the use of the rich class of quantile regression models for a large class of applications that were previously not amenable to these techniques.  The proposed framework will include the high-dimensional setting where the number of covariates could potentially exceed the number of observations, a common occurrence in many biological, medical, and economics applications. The research will be broadly disseminated in scientific journals, at conferences and seminars, and software packages in R will be developed.  As the proposed research is placed at the intersection of modern statistical methodology, computation, and theory with substantial applications, it will be suitable for training graduate students with a broad range of skills.<br/> <br/>The proposed research will develop novel and efficient statistical methods for quantile regression models when the responses are subject to arbitrary censoring, that is, multiple censoring types including single, double and interval censoring can occur within the same dataset, and the covariates can be high-dimensional.  Three fundamental problems in censored quantile modeling will be considered in this project: (i) develop efficient inferential methods under arbitrary censoring and study their theoretical properties, (ii) devise computationally scalable algorithms having statistically desirable properties that can handle high-dimensional covariates, and (iii) develop models that account for subgroups having heterogeneous quantile effects.  A fundamental challenge that will be tackled is how data augmentation and the Bayesian framework can be efficiently utilized when an explicit likelihood is unavailable. An important feature of the methods is their computational scalability while having desirable statistical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, they are sometimes inaccurate, which can lead to damaging consequences. Understanding how the human brain processes sensory information to form coherent and representative perceptions of the world is therefore scientifically important and has broad implications for national health (e.g., radiologists detecting a tumor), security and defense (e.g., accurately responding to a perceived threat), and general safety and well-being (e.g., correctly perceiving the color of a traffic light). With funding from the National Science Foundation, this research assesses how attention and associated changes in brain activity facilitate the successful combination of different types of sensory information into accurate perceptions. By focusing on errors in perceptual binding, such as misperceiving the color of one object as being the color of another nearby object, these studies will provide insights into the brain states that allow perception to proceed with precision and those that cause perception to fail. In addition to advancing scientific knowledge about the brain, this research will provide training opportunities to many students, including high school and undergraduate students as well as underrepresented students in the STEM fields. <br/><br/>The proposed experiments will examine the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved with visual feature binding and multisensory integration. The investigators will use converging methods to test whether modulations of attention and neural oscillations affect sensory integration. These methods include structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure neural activity during successful and unsuccessful visual feature binding and multisensory integration, electroencephalography (EEG) and fast signal optical imaging to measure changes in oscillatory neural activity prior to and after sensory integration, and rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to alter sensory integration by modulating and inducing phase-controlled neural oscillations. These studies will shed light on how sensory information that is processed in discrete regions of the human brain might be combined through neural oscillations to produce coherent representations of the external world. They will also provide a better understanding of failures in perception. By examining how different brain regions integrate information through synchronized neural activity, these studies may also provide important clues for generating strategies and rehabilitative tools for individuals with a variety of congenital, developmental, and acquired impairments that affect sensory processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Substantial variation between rift zones worldwide indicates that continental breakup is dictated by a complex interplay of tectonic forces and geologic characteristics. Therefore, it is critical to understand the full context for a rifting system, from the highly extended rift center that houses volcanoes and earthquakes to the flanks of the rift, where extension is just beginning and pre-rift structures are still evident. The Main Ethiopian Rift segment of the East Africa rift is perhaps the world's most iconic continental rift. New imaging techniques will be applied to recently acquired seismic data spanning this rift to reveal the 3-D internal structure of this rift and shed light on key geologic processes in this and other rifts around the world. This project involves collaboration with scientists from Ethiopia and provides career opportunities for early career researchers under-represented in the Earth sciences. <br/><br/>Detailed imaging of the internal structure of an entire rift system, from flank to axis, can shed light on the mechanics, controls, and time-dependency of extensional processes in the Main Ethiopian Rift. Recently acquired data from a wide aperture broadband seismic array is critical in sampling pre-rifted structure that may control rift dynamics, as well as to image the geodynamically crucial transitional zone between rift axis and flank.  Our tomographic technique entails simultaneous inversion of P and S receiver functions with Rayleigh wave phase velocities within a Bayesian framework; this approach is ideally suited to capture lithologic/seismic discontinuities, the presence of melt, and complex 3-D rift structure. Anisotropic body wave inversions and splitting studies will help constrain the locus of melt as well as the time-integrated strain history of this rift. This project utilizes seismic data from a number of previous projects in the region, combining the strengths of multiple deployments to achieve a synoptic understanding.  Collaboration with Ethiopian scientists and supporting the early careers of under-represented researchers are among the broader impacts of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to understand the role of foraging and aggressive behavior in determining hurricane survival in the honey bees of Puerto Rico. Africanized bees invaded Puerto Rico in the 1950's, initially creating highly aggressive populations as has occurred elsewhere. Since their introduction, the Africanized bees of Puerto Rico have uniquely become less aggressive over time, as evidenced by a wealth of pre-hurricane genetic and behavioral data. This project addresses the hypothesis that storms, such as Hurricane Maria that hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, select against more aggressive colonies and favor bees that invest more in foraging and food hoarding. The researchers will test this hypothesis by sampling the remaining post-hurricane populations and comparing them with the pre-hurricane data. RAPID funding will provide the opportunity to study both genetic and behavioral traits of survivors and their offspring within the months immediately following the storm. The study of a population's response subsequent to major environmental and anthropogenic disturbances is of importance to the understanding of processes that shape natural and agricultural ecosystems. This project will also support Puerto Rican students to maintain research productivity in a lab severely damaged by the hurricane. <br/><br/>The genomes of bees from post-Hurricane Maria wild populations and domestic populations will be sequenced and analyzed to determine signatures of selection or genetic bottleneck by comparing them with pre-hurricane genotypes. Polymorphic markers across the genome will be used to test a larger number (>1500) of specimens over a greater geographic area (i.e. Puerto Rico) to examine evolutionary trends and processes.  Comparisons of genetics, genomics and behavior of pre- and post-hurricane, feral and domesticated populations will test hypotheses on role of large disturbances such as hurricanes or anthropogenic influences on reducing aggressive behavior in Africanized honey bees.  Untangling the effects of chance and selective processes on honey bee genomes may identify a novel and general role of environmental disturbance in the evolution of aggressive behavior in colonial organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Snail larvae swim up with more effort or sink in response to cues from waves and turbulence, and it remains unclear whether larvae can use these physical cues for retention within or navigation among habitats.  Larvae that swim up under waves may be retained over the continental shelf by wave-induced shoreward drift in surface waters. However, ocean warming causes larvae to be released earlier in spring when waves are larger and coastal upwelling is weaker, potentially carrying larvae into shallower waters that exceed the adults' temperature tolerance. The investigators will use a physical model of the Middle Atlantic Bight and adjacent estuaries to test hypotheses about how waves and turbulence affect transport patterns, retention near adult habitats, and climate-induced shifts in adult distributions. The project will produce simulations of ocean circulation and larval tracking codes that include waves both as behavior cues and as a transport mechanism; these products will be made publicly available. A graduate student will do a related dissertation. Undergraduate students will be involved through an NSF-funded REU program, the Aresty Program, which engages Rutgers' diverse undergraduates in research to boost retention in STEM majors, the Rutgers Research in Science and Engineering program, which targets underrepresented minorities, and the Skidmore Summer Research program. Model outputs will be used to develop learning materials for undergraduates, packaged as a case study for distribution through the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science. Research results will also be presented to adult (55 and over) learners through the Skidmore Encore lecture series.<br/><br/>Waves are unique in providing planktonic larvae with a behavior cue directly tied to a horizontal transport mechanism, and newly discovered larval responses to waves could have counter-intuitive impacts on larval transport and species distributions.  Wave climates differ in the adjacent habitats of two congeneric snails: Tritia obsoleta occupies turbulent inlets and estuaries where waves are small, while Tritia trivittata occupies the continental shelf where waves are much larger. These two species' larvae sense waves and turbulence separately as acceleration and vorticity-induced body rotation, respectively.

Most efforts to predict ecological responses to environmental changes only try to predict the future geographical ranges of species, not the actual number of individuals across the range, even though numbers are likely to be a far more important measure of ecological functioning. Among the problems with forecasting either range shifts or changes in numbers is the variability in the environment from year to year, such that short-term responses of species may be very different than long-term trends, necessitating the long-term studies to be carried out in this project. In addition, populations of widespread species often show adaptation to the local environment, so that the range of climatic conditions tolerated by a species as a whole may not reflect the suitable conditions for individuals in any one population. Ignoring local adaptation may lead to inaccurate predictions of both geographical ranges and numbers of individuals. Finally, the scientists leading this project will develop training materials and teach workshops to high school teachers in order to improve students' understanding of the ecological responses to changes in climate and other environmental conditions.<br/><br/>This project is designed to address these and other problems in predicting ecological responses to future environmental conditions, using a long-term data set combined with new experiments. The study focuses on two wide-spread plants that occur in western North America from northernmost Alaska to central New Mexico. Seventeen years of data on the species at sites across this latitudinal range have shown how environmental change can influence survival, growth and reproduction of these plants. In the current project, plants will be transplanted between multiple sites to test for local adaptation to environmental change in the field (evidence from growth chamber experiments suggests the potential for such adaptation). Using these data and those from past and ongoing surveys of natural populations, new models will be developed to predict plant numbers in response to local environmental conditions for populations across the continent. These predictions will then be tested against current distributions and population sizes. After this validation, the local models will be tied to global models to improve predictions of ecological responses to future environmental conditions. The goals of the project are both to better predict how these particular species will respond to changes in their environment and to develop and test methods for making such predictions that can be used for many other species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than 100 of the world's brightest and most motivated high school students will gather for the Linguistics Olympiad. The American teams, each comprised of four students, were top finishers in the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO), held in January and March, 2018. <br/><br/>The International Linguistics Olympiad provides students with a hands-on experience of the scientific approach to linguistics and the documentation and analysis of language. Unlike math and science Olympiads, which focus on material that students have already mastered, linguistics Olympiads introduce new material through logic puzzles in languages unfamiliar to the students. In the course of solving a puzzle, the students can discover something about the grammar or sounds of a language, its conceptual system, its associated culture, or its historical relationship to other languages. In addition to fostering insight into human linguistic and cultural diversity, this competition fosters meta-linguistic reasoning that is essential for computer science, language technologies, and indeed any career involving analytical problem-solving skills and the ability to present a logical argument supported by data. Because it has been the tradition of linguistics Olympiads to base half of the score on the written explanation of the answer, the contests also encourage the ability to clearly present a hypothesis and explain how it is supported by the data.  After attending a training session at Carnegie Mellon University, the US team will travel to Prague to compete with teams from 30 other countries. The IOL serves as a capstone international experience for the winners of NACLO, allowing the team members to compete and interact with other students who share their talents and interests.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators will analyze regions of the genome showing evidence for adaptations unique to the human lineage, to better understand the advent, nature, and importance of neural differentiation between humans and non-human primates. The project will provide student-led educational experiences using a next-generation sequencing platform for hands-on training.

Using a curated bioinformatics catalog of putative enhancers, this project will test the hypothesis that there are functional links between adaptation in the genome and changes in neural phenotypes that occurred during human evolution. In order to understand the functional consequences of mutations particular to human regulatory regions, changes in gene expression associated with particular gene regulatory sequences will be measured. This will be done in neural progenitor cells and in mature neurons, in both human and chimpanzee cell lines. To functionally test these regions, cutting-edge high-throughput enhancer assays will be used to measure significant differences in how these ~10,000 implicated regulatory regions are driving differential gene expression in neural progenitor cells and mature neurons. Both of these cell types will be derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, which have the capacity to be driven to many different cell types.

Single molecule measurements provide information about each molecules that move at a fast rate or rare events that would otherwise be buried by bulk measurements.  To monitor the movement and structural changes of biomolecules at such a small scale, Professor Reinhard makes a molecular ruler based on optical interaction of gold nanoparticles (NPs). Fast and subtle changes in biomolecular structure and movements lead to changes in the spectral signature of these gold NPs, which can be captured at fast speed and be used to understand the behavior of biomolecules. The developed technique could elucidate the role of structural fluctuations of proteins and other biomolecules in complex biological systems, which could lead to new advances in biological, biomedical, and environmental research.  Professor Reinhard works with his graduate and undergraduate students on the project, providing them an opportunity to work at the interface between biophysical chemistry, bioplasmonics, and biomaterials. Professor Reinhard also organizes workshops, offers research internships, and develops web-modules to share with the general public of his research outcomes. A particular emphasis of his outreach activities is to attract members of groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering to the research of this project.<br/><br/>Professor Reinhard is developing a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) based correlation spectroscopy. He utilizes distance-dependent near-field coupling between plasmonic NPs that cause spectral fluctuations in the far-field to monitor interparticle separations which would allow him to obtain long-time signal correlation studies of individual biopolymer molecules entirely without blinking artefacts. In this project, Professor Reinhard uses plasmon coupling correlation spectroscopy (PCCS) to measure the effect of nanoconfinement on the mechanical properties of DNA and experimentally test the validity of conventional polymer models under nano-confinement. He also works on understanding the structural dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) by providing an accurate characterization of the structural fluctuations over a broad frequency range in order to develop predictive function models based on structural dynamics. The ability to elucidate the role of structural fluctuations for the function of disordered proteins and other biopolymers is important and necessary to develop a fundamental understanding of their working mechanism, which remains enigmatic. The project involves testing how spatial nanoconfinement, which is ubiquitous in biological systems, effects and potentially changes the structural dynamics of biopolymers. Besides the research goals, Professor Reinhard is working on a series of educational and outreach activities to actively mentoring students in interdisciplinary research and encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Snail larvae swim up with more effort or sink in response to cues from waves and turbulence, and it remains unclear whether larvae can use these physical cues for retention within or navigation among habitats.  Larvae that swim up under waves may be retained over the continental shelf by wave-induced shoreward drift in surface waters. However, ocean warming causes larvae to be released earlier in spring when waves are larger and coastal upwelling is weaker, potentially carrying larvae into shallower waters that exceed the adults' temperature tolerance. The investigators will use a physical model of the Middle Atlantic Bight and adjacent estuaries to test hypotheses about how waves and turbulence affect transport patterns, retention near adult habitats, and climate-induced shifts in adult distributions. The project will produce simulations of ocean circulation and larval tracking codes that include waves both as behavior cues and as a transport mechanism; these products will be made publicly available. A graduate student will do a related dissertation. Undergraduate students will be involved through an NSF-funded REU program, the Aresty Program, which engages Rutgers' diverse undergraduates in research to boost retention in STEM majors, the Rutgers Research in Science and Engineering program, which targets underrepresented minorities, and the Skidmore Summer Research program. Model outputs will be used to develop learning materials for undergraduates, packaged as a case study for distribution through the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science. Research results will also be presented to adult (55 and over) learners through the Skidmore Encore lecture series.<br/><br/>Waves are unique in providing planktonic larvae with a behavior cue directly tied to a horizontal transport mechanism, and newly discovered larval responses to waves could have counter-intuitive impacts on larval transport and species distributions.  Wave climates differ in the adjacent habitats of two congeneric snails: Tritia obsoleta occupies turbulent inlets and estuaries where waves are small, while Tritia trivittata occupies the continental shelf where waves are much larger. These two species' larvae sense waves and turbulence separately as acceleration and vorticity-induced body rotation, respectively. Late-stage estuarine larvae mainly exhibit turbulence-induced sinking that could reduce transport out of inlets and estuaries, whereas shelf larvae also exhibit wave-induced upward swimming that could aid retention over the shelf via Stokes drift.

In addition, the conference will attempt to bring together the Formal Verification community and the community of researchers working on the formal logic-based version of motivic integration. Both fields share similar techniques and the exchange of ideas between the two fields should be very fruitful. Formal verification of (broadly adopted) encryption standards is ultimately an issue pertaining to the foundation of society, and the involvement of the mathematical community in such efforts is absolutely crucial. The conference will feature a session on formal verification of encryption standards, including a public lecture on a recently verified NIST cryptographic standard.

However, the scope of that insurance is limited by information and contract enforcement problems. The result is a model that is more realistic than other general equilibrium macroeconomic models, and a model that is simple enough to study a wide variety of issues facing the macroeconomy. In particular, the project will give researchers a new framework for studying the interaction between macroeconomic performance, financial intermediation, and household inequality. Researchers and policymakers will be able to use the framework to understand how this link is shaped by economic policy and impacted by macroeconomic shocks. The team plans to include studies of specific government policies and the ways that these policies can improve economic competitiveness.<br/><br/>The project seeks to develop a new, analytically tractable general equilibrium macroeconomic model with idiosyncratic income risk and endogenous financial contracts. To do so, long-term contractual arrangements between risk-averse households and risk-neutral competitive financial intermediaries will be embedded into a stationary version of the neoclassical growth model. The project combines two strands of the literature. The first is the standard incomplete markets model with uninsurable idiosyncratic income shocks and neoclassical production. The second is the researcher team's previous work on dynamic insurance contracts offered by competitive financial intermediaries. The new model framework has a key feature: limits to mutual insurance are derived endogenously rather than being imposed by assumption. The resulting model will then be applied to transitions induced by economic policy and to the analysis of business cycles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A proof-of-concept attack hit the Ukraine in 2015, and cut off the power supply to hundreds of thousands of people for several hours. In many successful cyber attacks so far, security vulnerabilities in software have played an important role, exposing systems to attackers who aim to compromise and hence control the system. Vulnerabilities may exist in controllers, meters, circuit breakers, and control computers, and as such, electric utilities usually use vulnerability and patch management to monitor the security vulnerabilities of assets, analyze the remediation and mitigation action for each vulnerability (e.g., applying a patch), and deploy the action to secure the vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. This remains a heavily manual process in the energy sector, where electric utilities spend a tremendous amount of time on such analyses over a large number of vulnerabilities, and increases the time window in which vulnerabilities are known but not mitigated, putting the system into a high risk of being attacked. This problem has received insufficient attention and has defied commercial solutions. This project will address this problem through automating this analysis process. If successful, it will drastically reduce the human resources and time spent by electric utilities on vulnerability and patch management, and increase the security of the nation's energy infrastructure through mitigating vulnerabilities much more quickly. This project will also develop a training course for security operators in electric utilities and a graduate-level course on vulnerability and patch management. Industry workshops and tutorials on security conferences will be developed to disseminate research discoveries. Undergraduate students and underrepresented students will be involved in the research.<br/> <br/>This project aims to develop methodologies for automated vulnerability and patch management in electric utilities that can expedite decision making of how to remedy and mitigate security vulnerabilities. It has several research tasks. (i) Develop an automated solution that can predict whether a vulnerability should be patched immediately or mitigated in other ways. A prediction model will be built using machine learning methods to predict human operators' remediation actions for vulnerabilities, and easy-to-verify rationale will be provided so that security operators can validate the predictions if needed. (ii) Design a quantitative approach for automating mitigation action analysis. This task will devise a data flow model to capture the interactions between mitigation actions and system components and the interactions among system components, and formulate mitigation action selection as an optimization problem, where the goal is to minimize the negative impact of the selected mitigation actions for a given set of vulnerabilities to the power grid. (iii) Develop a prototype of the proposed tools and conduct field tests in electric utility partners. (iv) Develop recommendations for the vulnerability and patch management ecosystem, including vendors, third-party services, regulation authorities, and standardization organizations. The recommendations to the whole ecosystem developed in this project aims for a systematic, multi-party approach for mitigating vulnerabilities, offering the potential to transform vulnerability and patch management practices in the energy sector from manual to automated operations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This volcanic ash (also called tephra) is deposited on land or in water bodies, and may become preserved in the geological record. Studies of tephra are important for a wide range of purposes including learning about the eruptive history of a volcano to anticipate potential future behavior, and correlating and dating rock layers for paleoanthropology and paleoclimatology studies. Traditionally, much of this work has been carried out by separate groups of researchers from these various disciplines, and a significant amount of data is then published in specialized literature, and hard to discover. A centralized database of tephra occurrence in East Africa would help overcome this barrier and encourage the use of existing valuable datasets, but also answer fundamental questions about the evolution of volcanism in East Africa through time. This project will address this need by building the East African Rift Tephra Database (EARThD), a comprehensive database that will integrate, standardize, and investigate geochemical and age tephra datasets from the East African Rift focusing on the record from the past 5 million years. <br/><br/>The EARThD project will utilize the existing NSF-supported community-based data facility, Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA), to store, curate, and provide access to geochemical data and metadata through IEDA's EarthChem library. Tephra samples from published articles will be assigned an International Sample Geo Number (IGSN) and associated datasets and metadata will be entered and formatted using standardized IEDA templates. The development of EARThD will fulfill the currently non-existent but crucial data integration and standardization effort needed to support the growing East African Rift tephra record and the increasingly complex and interdisciplinary research questions being studied. It will benefit a broad scientific community by encouraging and facilitating the cross-disciplinary use of tephra geochemical data and involve undergraduate student researchers. Results of this project will provide a clearer understanding of the temporal variations of explosive volcanism along the East African Rift, including the frequency and magnitude of past eruptions and long-term geochemical variations in response to continental rifting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project includes collaborations with six high needs school districts: Gloucester and New Kent Counties (rural); York and Williamsburg-James City Counties (suburban); and Newport News and Hampton (urban).  A major project goal is developing a new model to: (1) interest outstanding mathematics majors in teaching; (2) help students sustain an enduring commitment to STEM teaching; and (3) develop students' ability to connect effectively with diverse communities.  The project will work with the WM Office of Community Engagement to engage first- and second-year mathematics and science students in teaching activities and reflection.  Working with WM community engagement staff, prospective teachers will explore issues of fair access to skills in mathematics and science for all students.  These activities will expand preliminary research on factors that enhance the motivation of prospective teachers for STEM teaching.  Once recruited into the Noyce Program, Noyce scholars will take two project-specific courses.  The ""How Students Learn"" course will focus on how to teach learning skills and self-management.  The other course, a Practicum in High Need Schools, will use early visits to high-need schools to help Noyce Scholars understand how skilled STEM teachers can effectively support student success.  The project will also offer opportunities for experiences and courses in special education and teaching English language learners.  The project will supplement cultural competency preparation in the curriculum with activities focused on equity-mindedness and working with diverse communities.  Following placement of new STEM teachers in schools, a mentoring program will engage teachers in skill-building and problem-solving in their first years of teaching.<br/><br/>This project intends to recruit and prepare 33 new teachers who are licensed in STEM disciplines.  STEM majors will be recruited from two pools: (1) Undergraduate STEM majors, including transfer students, who will gain licensure as undergraduates or through a fifth-year master's program; and (2) Post-baccalaureates in STEM fields who will complete a master's program in mathematics or science education.  Recruitment will focus on regional institutions, including those with high proportions of underrepresented minority students.  Prospective mathematics and science teachers will be supported in gaining certification in science teaching for grades 6-12, and in mathematics teaching for grades K-8 or 6-12.  Partners include six high-need school districts.  The project intends to continue to develop existing partnerships with high-need schools to prepare more cooperating teachers to supervise and mentor Noyce Scholars during student teaching. A key objective is to integrate the project's data in a published model that can inform other programs to improve recruitment and preparation of STEM teachers.  Through preparation of new STEM teachers and development of a model to initiate and sustain commitments to teaching in high-need schools, the project has the potential to support societal goals of effective preparation of teachers for diverse communities of learners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, differential pathogen exposure across ancient populations may have resulted in modern day population differences in immune function. This project will investigate how Yersinia pestis (plague) exposure in past populations may have affected modern day human immune system function and outcomes of illness. The investigators will compare the responses of macrophages (cells required by Y. pestis to establish an infection) from individuals descended from populations with putative severe historic plague exposure (European) and substantially lesser plague exposure (West African). The research findings will advance our understanding of the role of pathogens in human evolution, and may inform public health research on immune function. The project will provide laboratory training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, including groups underrepresented in science, and foster a diverse, international research network. Findings will be distributed not only through peer-reviewed publications, conferences and popular press, but directly to the public through university-organized adult education seminars and child science engagement events.<br/><br/>Human immune systems have functionally diverged, with geographic populations exhibiting differences in immune responses to particular pathogens, and in the manifestation of chronic inflammatory/autoimmune diseases and cancers. One possible contributing factor to the strong functional divergence in immunity seen in such a comparatively young species is differing degrees of natural selection on the immune system by ""local"" past infectious disease epidemics. Plague has been posited to be one of the strongest agents of disease-based natural selection in human history. Encountered by Eurasian and North and Central African populations until it disseminated worldwide during the late 19th century, Y. pestis is estimated to have killed 30-50% of the European population during the ""Black Death"" outbreak of the 14th century. Plague, therefore, has long been suspected of altering the immune function of European populations. There has been little examination of human immune responses to Y. pestis to assess assertions that it is a factor in the divergence of immunity and health of human populations. The objective of this study is to clarify how immune responses in modern populations with differing historical plague exposure have evolved and respond to Y. pestis. By infecting macrophages from historically severely- and lesser-exposed populations with Y. pestis in vitro and assessing whole genome expression, cell physiological responses and evidence of natural selection, this project aims to identify 1) population-level variation in genomic and cell physiological responses to plague, 2) immune responses that are more plague-specific, and 3) responding genes that are evolving. These data will be compared to responses to other bacterial infections, and assessed for association with acute and chronic diseases of differing prevalence in European and African American populations. In combination this work will better define how differing infectious disease histories are reflected in the immune function of modern human populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They arise in many forms such  as digital images for (1) medical diagnostics (MRI, CT scans, DTI of the brain), (2) scene recognition from satellite images, (3) identifying defects in manufactured products, (4) artificial intelligence (robotic identification of objects), etc. Proper geometric descriptions of these require tools from modern differential geometry. Classical statistical methods are inadequate for their analysis; parametric models, which assume the form of the distribution of the underlying data modulo a finite number of unknown parameters, are often misspecified. A model-independent methodology developed by the PI and others has been shown to be very effective in analyzing such data. The present project aims at vastly broadening the scope of this methodology for applications. <br/><br/>A basic component of the methodology proposed is the notion of the Fre'chet mean of a probability Q on a metric space, which minimizes the expected squared distance from a point. The metric space is generally a differential manifold, often provided with a natural Riemannian metric. But it may also be a so called geodesic space of non-positive curvature, including many graphical spaces as well as stratified spaces made up of manifolds of different dimensions glued together. For the methodology to work one must establish (a) the uniqueness of the Fre'chet minimizer and (b) the asymptotic distribution of the sample Fre'chet mean. It is one of the goals of the present project to significantly extend the earlier theory in this regard, opening the way to many new applications. Another important objective is to extend to such spaces the nonparametric Bayes theory of density estimation, classification and regression. One special aim here is to explore an intriguing phenomenon:  in simulation studies with moderate sample sizes, the nonparametric Bayes estimator of the density of Q far outperforms not only the kernel density estimator, but also the MLE when the data are simulated from a parametric model! An understanding of this is expected to lead to a wider and more effective use of the nonparametric Bayes methodology. Finally, the PI proposes to develop a graphical method for robotic vision of objects, with much less computational complexity than that of other methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary data suggest that Glacial Lake Roscommon (GLR) came into existence circa 24-23,000 years ago and persisted for over 7000 years, in an area previously thought to be ice-covered until nearly 16,000 years ago.  Research on this lake will refine the understanding of Midwestern glacial dynamics, thereby improving modeling of ice-sheet thickness for North America.  A better understanding of glacial retreat in this area, and of past glacial processes in general, will enhance the ability to locate important natural resources derived from glacial landforms such as aggregate, as well as sand and clay, and will help model aquifer continuity and hence, improve present-day groundwater management strategies.  Several remnant lakes from GLR still exist in the study area and may have existed continuously since deglaciation.  Sediment cores from these lakes will be dated and analyzed for fossil pollen, plant macrofossils, and snail shells, yielding important insights into the immediate postglacial climate of the region, and providing new insights into the earliest forms of plant colonization of cold, recently deglaciated landscapes.  The project provides many opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student training and mentoring, both in the field and in the laboratory.  Results from the research will be broadly disseminated in academic and non-academic outlets and the work will be the focus of a regional field conference.<br/><br/>The recent scientific documentation of Glacial Lake Roscommon (GLR), offers a rare opportunity to generate new knowledge and contribute to the rewriting the glacial history of the upper Midwest.  The lake is unique, having developed in the upper Great Lakes region at a time when other Midwestern glaciers were near their maximum extent.  This area was thought to have been ice-covered until about 16,000 years ago, implying that the sediments from the lake and its remnants may contain the longest record of pollen and other fossils in the upper Midwest.  Such a long record is exceedingly rare.  The potential of this record will be examined by coring several remnant lakes, dating the lowermost plant matter in each core using radiocarbon technology, and examining those data to determine the oldest core.  Data on pollen, macrofossils, and ostracodes from these cores will then be examined to provide an unprecedented view into the environment at a time when ice dominated the landscape, and postglacial plant colonization was just beginning.  A second focus of the research is the determination of the geological record of GLR and the retreating ice margin within it is.  This part of the project involves dating of beach and related sediments, using luminescence technologies.  Such data will help constrain the evolution of the lake and its bounding ice margins, and thus, add key data for ice-sheet models.  Because the lake had at least three different outlets, constraining the opening and abandonment of these outlets will help determine the ice retreat scenarios for bounding landscapes.  Early data suggest that ice on nearby landscapes had also retreated, or had begun retreating, far earlier than is currently thought.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Communication and computing capabilities are increasingly being integrated into even the most commonplace items, forming an interconnected network of devices capable of independent and cooperative action. These connected objects can coordinate their actions to improve the efficiency and performance of systems such as smart power grids and automated traffic control systems. However, the widespread sharing of data also risks divulging private information. For example, the exchange of very detailed consumer usage profiles between network operators and dispatch units enables optimized power forecast, generation, and distribution in a smart grid, but also allows others to infer knowledge about the presence, absence, or even the specific activities of a home's occupants. Classical encryption is too slow to be deployed in time-critical engineering applications such as self-driving cars, where carefully tuned controllers generate tens or hundreds of commands per second. The insight developed in this project is that exchanged information, and even control commands, can be obscured by the innovative application of existing control architectures. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and outline its major features. The results of this project will advance national prosperity by offering the economic advantages of communication and coordination, without violating confidentiality. The research results will be integrated into the graduate curriculum, and into undergraduate research projects supervised by the Principal Investigator.<br/><br/>This project will explore the stabilization of decentralized coordination algorithms under random time-varying coupling weights which will be used for obscuring information. With recent advances in wireless communications and networking, decentralized coordination algorithms have become widespread in networked robots, sensor networks, and intelligent transportation systems. Although their inherent flexibility and scalability make decentralized coordination algorithms appealing for large-scale systems, they also pose significant challenges to privacy protection design. This is because conventional privacy-preserving mechanisms rely on the assistance of a central data aggregator or a trusted third party -- mechanisms that are ruled out in a decentralized implementation. This project builds upon recent results by the Investigator, specifically a privacy-preserving mechanism which obscures information through uncertain time-varying controls. The approach does not need the assistance of any third party and is superior to existing approaches in terms of flexibility, scalability, accuracy, and computation overhead. However, this privacy-preserving approach leads to random time-varying coupling weights, whose influence on decentralized coordination is unclear. This project will address this problem through rigorous analysis of the convergence conditions and speed of decentralized coordination under random time-varying coupling weights. The main thrusts of the project are first to characterize the condition under which nonlinear consensus can be achieved when coupling weights are time-varying and randomly chosen from a certain interval, next to analyze the convergence speed of decentralized coordination under random time-varying coupling weights, and finally to systematically verify obtained results using a multi-robot test bed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most efforts to predict ecological responses to environmental changes only try to predict the future geographical ranges of species, not the actual number of individuals across the range, even though numbers are likely to be a far more important measure of ecological functioning. Among the problems with forecasting either range shifts or changes in numbers is the variability in the environment from year to year, such that short-term responses of species may be very different than long-term trends, necessitating the long-term studies to be carried out in this project. In addition, populations of widespread species often show adaptation to the local environment, so that the range of climatic conditions tolerated by a species as a whole may not reflect the suitable conditions for individuals in any one population. Ignoring local adaptation may lead to inaccurate predictions of both geographical ranges and numbers of individuals. Finally, the scientists leading this project will develop training materials and teach workshops to high school teachers in order to improve students' understanding of the ecological responses to changes in climate and other environmental conditions.<br/><br/>This project is designed to address these and other problems in predicting ecological responses to future environmental conditions, using a long-term data set combined with new experiments. The study focuses on two wide-spread plants that occur in western North America from northernmost Alaska to central New Mexico. Seventeen years of data on the species at sites across this latitudinal range have shown how environmental change can influence survival, growth and reproduction of these plants. In the current project, plants will be transplanted between multiple sites to test for local adaptation to environmental change in the field (evidence from growth chamber experiments suggests the potential for such adaptation). Using these data and those from past and ongoing surveys of natural populations, new models will be developed to predict plant numbers in response to local environmental conditions for populations across the continent. These predictions will then be tested against current distributions and population sizes. After this validation, the local models will be tied to global models to improve predictions of ecological responses to future environmental conditions. The goals of the project are both to better predict how these particular species will respond to changes in their environment and to develop and test methods for making such predictions that can be used for many other species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This volcanic ash (also called tephra) is deposited on land or in water bodies, and may become preserved in the geological record. Studies of tephra are important for a wide range of purposes including learning about the eruptive history of a volcano to anticipate potential future behavior, and correlating and dating rock layers for paleoanthropology and paleoclimatology studies. Traditionally, much of this work has been carried out by separate groups of researchers from these various disciplines, and a significant amount of data is then published in specialized literature, and hard to discover. A centralized database of tephra occurrence in East Africa would help overcome this barrier and encourage the use of existing valuable datasets, but also answer fundamental questions about the evolution of volcanism in East Africa through time. This project will address this need by building the East African Rift Tephra Database (EARThD), a comprehensive database that will integrate, standardize, and investigate geochemical and age tephra datasets from the East African Rift focusing on the record from the past 5 million years. <br/><br/>The EARThD project will utilize the existing NSF-supported community-based data facility, Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA), to store, curate, and provide access to geochemical data and metadata through IEDA's EarthChem library. Tephra samples from published articles will be assigned an International Sample Geo Number (IGSN) and associated datasets and metadata will be entered and formatted using standardized IEDA templates. The development of EARThD will fulfill the currently non-existent but crucial data integration and standardization effort needed to support the growing East African Rift tephra record and the increasingly complex and interdisciplinary research questions being studied. It will benefit a broad scientific community by encouraging and facilitating the cross-disciplinary use of tephra geochemical data and involve undergraduate student researchers. Results of this project will provide a clearer understanding of the temporal variations of explosive volcanism along the East African Rift, including the frequency and magnitude of past eruptions and long-term geochemical variations in response to continental rifting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second main object of this investigation are ""graphs"". In computer science they are used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices. An embedding of graphs, or more generally metric spaces, which may represent a large data set, into a Banach space, is necessary to be able to store this data set efficiently. Secondly it is necessary to provide the Banach space with the right coordinate system, it is therefore also necessary to be able to embed a Banach space, into a Banach space admitting the appropriate coordinate system. The problems that will be studied in this project revolve around the issue of embedding less structured mathematical objects like graphs or, more generally, metric spaces, into better structured objects like Banach spaces. On one hand the goal is to obtain information about the structure of the graph, from the property that it embeds in certain Banach spaces, and on the other hand deduce geometric properties of a Banach space, from the property that certain graphs embed or do not embed in it.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will investigate possible extensions of Ribe's Program on metric characterizations of local properties of Banach spaces to characterizing asymptotic properties. An important question for example is the question whether or not the property of a Banach space to be reflexive can be metrically characterized. Other important properties to be considered are uniform asymptotic convexity and uniform asymptotic smoothness. The principal investigator will also study the problem of isomorphically embedding Banach spaces, having a certain property, into Banach spaces with a coordinates system like a Schauder basis or an unconditional basis. Finally the principal investigator will continue the study of closed sub-ideals of the spaces of operators on specific Banach spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Opioids are addictive pain relievers that are profitable in illicit markets and pose challenges for healthcare providers who are responsible for treating pain and for enforcement agents who are tasked with ensuring proper drug provision. Several states have responded by adopting prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), surveillance technologies designed for healthcare and criminal justice use. However, researchers and policymakers have not fully considered how this technology will impact professional fields. This project will examine how current efforts to curb the opioid crisis affect healthcare and criminal justice workers. This project asks:  how does policing patients affect healthcare practice? And, how does targeting healthcare providers affect law enforcement? Addressing these questions is important because requiring workers to venture beyond their traditional scopes of practice could undermine their professional commitments and negatively impact professional community members. This research contributes to policy by including both health care and enforcement workers, aiming to develop policy solutions amenable to both fields. It advances education by enlisting the help of undergraduate research assistants. Findings will inform policymakers and clinicians about ways to address the opioid crisis while avoiding unintended consequences.<br/><br/><br/>This project examines the opioid epidemic as a case for understanding how social problems transform social fields. The primary goal is to extend sociological and socio-legal theory by developing a micro-level theory of field change. This project uses a mixed-methods, comparative design across three states, California, Florida, and Missouri, that will culminate in four original qualitative and quantitative data sets. These data will be analyzed with the assistance of an undergraduate research team using grounded theory techniques. This research contributes by addressing intersections between law and medicine and by using nested maximum variation samples to capture field-level heterogeneity and change. Although most research on opioid abuse is heavily siloed, focusing either on healthcare or law enforcement, this research brings together insights from both fields. Findings will inform policy makers and healthcare leaders about how using technology to combat opioid abuse affects practice. Technology is often considered a panacea for addressing social problems, but this research brings a critical lens to technology, addressing the kinds of unintended consequences that might result from its use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The present project uses the brain's master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus, as a model system to tackle this problem. In the brain clock, the way individual elements interact can be studied at multiple levels; for example, clock genes, clock neurons, the brain clock as a whole, or the behavior and physiology of the animal. The project aims to reveal new information about how individual neurons are connected in a network that produces a 24-hour rhythm in the brain clock, and how this master brain clock provides timing information to the rest of the body. It already is known that individual neurons, each with internal clocks of their own, are organized in time and space into distinct clusters bearing stable phase relationships to each other. Preliminary data indicate that the brain clock contains phase-coherent, and highly organized, ""rings"" of cells. This is exciting: it is the first demonstration of functional network topography within a hypothalamic nucleus. Classically, the hypothalamus is viewed as loosely organized collections of neurons. In other brain regions, such as the auditory or the visual cortex, neurons are organized in specific 3-dimensional spatial formations that are important for information coding. The goal of this study is to understand information coding in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and how the newly discovered rings contribute to the brain clock's network and function. In all the work, research in both the biological and mathematical aspects of the studies engages women undergraduate students interested in Neuroscience and in Applied Mathematics.<br/><br/>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the master clock in the brain.  The goal of this project is to gain insight into information coding in the SCN and to elucidate how ring-like arrangements among cells in the SCN contribute to the clock's network and function. The first study establishes the orientation of the rings by using coronal, sagittal, and horizontal slices of the SCN in vivo. The results contribute to the development of mathematical models that characterize coherent structures within the SCN. The second study involves use of tissue clearing methods to visualize the structures of the rings observed in SCN slices. The third study serves to test the function of the rings both in adults and during development and in animals with mutations that alter circadian rhythmicity. At each step, mathematical models of ring functions are being developed in parallel with the biological work, and used to develop ideas on how to further understanding of the ring structures. The results from these studies provide a new level of analysis to previously established aspects of SCN organization and extend the understanding of the widely-accepted core/shell structure of the SCN. A unifying hypothesis is that this multi-scale organization provides robustness and resilience to the circadian oscillatory system, a hypothesis tested here via modeling, simulation, and biological analyses of mutant and wild type SCN.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wnt signaling is a group of highly conserved biochemical signal transduction pathways known for their involvement in various embryonic processes. The presence of Wnt signaling elements in the mature brain suggests that Wnt signaling may also play a role in the regulation of brain functions in the adult. This project examines the role and mechanisms of action of Wnt signaling in the mature brain, from the receptors through which Wnt initiates signal transduction to the targets of the transduction process, such as proteins critically involved in synaptic communication and plasticity. The findings provide insights into how signaling pathways involved in embryonic development are re-deployed to effect lasting modifications in adult organisms. They also inform the development of treatments for conditions in which synaptic transmission is compromised. In addition, the project provides training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers from underrepresented groups, with the goal of increasing their participation in science professions.<br/><br/>Wnt signaling is a highly conserved signal transduction mechanism that regulates embryonic development of metazoans; however, the sustained expression of Wnt signaling components in the mature central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates suggests that Wnt signaling cascades might also play a part in regulating brain function beyond embryonic development.  Recent findings by the investigator indicate that a non-canonical Wnt ligand upregulates synaptic currents mediated by NMDA-type glutamate receptors. This regulation requires Wnt receptor RoR2, an increase in intracellular Ca2+, and activation of PKC and JNK. The objectives of this project are to: (1) determine how the Wnt receptor RoR2 is activated and whether it is sufficient to initiate the signaling cascade leading to regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and (2) unravel the signaling cascade triggered by activation of RoR2 receptors.  To achieve these objectives, a range of approaches are applied, including biochemical techniques, live fluorescence Frster resonance energy transfer (FRET), in some experiments combined with FRET based biosensors, Ca2+ imaging, and electrophysiology. Understanding how RoR2 signals in the mature CNS of vertebrates provides insight into Wnt signaling in general, contributes to better understanding of the regulation of synaptic plasticity, and ultimately offers proof-of-principle evidence for a general process by which biological mechanisms used early in an organism's life can be coopted in the mature organism for homeostatic processes or new biological functions.

This social movement, involving both conventional outside activist groups and insider investor-activists, has been building for over a decade now.  The primary research goals of this project are to understand which firms are targeted by activists, which have changed their specific disclosure practices, which have gone even further and started restricting certain expenditures, and whether information related to political disclosure affects firms in the stock market and in terms of investor perceptions. The findings of this project will inform policy proposals, both internal and external to firms, regarding political disclosure requirements for U.S. corporations, which have been an ongoing topic of debate among policymakers. Results of these investigations will be disseminated widely through scholarly articles and writings for general-interest audiences including business and political leaders and the broader public. The project will also train graduate and undergraduate students and generate a variety of public-use datasets that will allow for further investigations by other scholars, as well as by journalists and students. <br/><br/>The research goals will be pursued in several ways.  Original databases of protests and political expenditure controversies (based on media reports) surrounding S&P 1500 firms over the period from 2005-2016 will be created. One analysis will examine how firms' past political activity and corporate interlock networks affect their likelihood of being targeted by either outside or investor activists.  Another analysis will investigate how protests and corporate shareholder resolutions affect firms' likelihood of changing their disclosure practices or restricting expenditures.  Interviews with leading shareholder-activists will be conducted.  A Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) event-study of how expenditure-related controversies affect firms' stock prices will be performed.  A series of experiments will be conducted to examine how changes to political disclosure practices affect investor perceptions of a firm's value. The project will advance scholarship in political and economic sociology, particularly regarding the political power of U.S. corporations in light of weakening corporate networks alongside rising shareholder capitalism.

Far beyond providing basic communications, wireless infrastructure comprises the backbone of the control and management functions of many Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, ranging from smart home solutions to autonomous vehicles. Therefore, countless efforts have been made to ensure the efficiency and reliability of such critical infrastructure. Against this backdrop, this project follows the same overarching theme of improving wireless infrastructure towards faster and seamless connectivity. From a scientific perspective, the project seeks to investigate the feasibility of fundamentally transforming the technical approach to wireless network design by shifting the focus from the data networks themselves to the ambient environment. From an industrial perspective, the project opens the way for the contribution of techniques to both improve cellular network link quality and enable co-existence of Wi-Fi technologies in dense urban deployments, where interference limits their effectiveness. From an educational perspective, the project has the potential to change the way academia teaches the topic of wireless communications and the wireless channel to undergraduate students and graduate students alike.<br/><br/>The traditional approach to optimizing wireless networks revolves around the wireless endpoints, i.e., the transmitters and the receivers, and takes the wireless channel as a hard constraint, invoking a multitude of solutions to fully utilize that channel. This project will instead focus on whether it is feasible to optimize the ambient wireless environment. Instead of changing the ways in which endpoints behave, the project will explore ways of changing the perceived channel along the wireless link to create more favorable conditions for wireless communication. Specifically, the team will explore how to instrument the wireless environment with small wireless elements to effect changes in the wireless channel that a wireless receiver measures from a wireless sender. A substrate comprising these elements is then combined with a control infrastructure that measures the channels between wireless senders and receivers in real time, and actuates the element substrate in order to effect channel variations. As a proof of concept, the team will explore using this design to improve individual links as well as reduce interference between concurrent links.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Single-molecule magnets are molecules that behave as nanoscale magnets at low temperatures and can display magnetic properties akin to both classical and quantum systems. A potential direct application of this work is in the fields of magnetic data storage, quantum computing, and spintronics, however the knowledge gained by understanding magnetic properties on the molecular level is applicable to a wide variety of magnetic materials. Single-molecule magnets typically only operate at very low temperatures (less than 60 K). The goal of this project is to synthesize new molecules which have even higher operating temperatures. The project lies at the interface of inorganic chemistry, coordination chemistry, and physics. Both Professor Long and the members of his group are active in disseminating their work to a broad scientific audience, and the graduate students in the group participate in programs which place them in local elementary and middle school classrooms for hands-on science lessons. <br/><br/>Single-molecule magnets are molecules with magnetically bistable ground states. When thermal energy is small relative to the thermal barrier between these states the magnetic molecule can retain its magnetization in the absence of an applied field. The proposed research adopts three strategies to synthesize single-molecule magnets which operate at higher temperatures. The first is to design systems with enhanced magnetic anisotropy, which will increase the thermal barrier to magnetic relaxation. Highly axial coordination environments will be employed for both transition metal and lanthanide complexes to achieve higher magnetic anisotropy. The second strategy is to utilize strong magnetic coupling to mitigate the effect of relaxation processes which shortcut the thermal barrier. Both transition metal and lanthanide complexes will be coupled with radical bridging ligands that promote strong metal-radical magnetic exchange. For transition metal complexes, direct metal-metal interactions will also lead to strongly coupled magnetic centers. Additionally, mixed 3d-4f systems will be developed to take advantage of both the large magnetic anisotropy of the lanthanides and the strong exchange coupling of the transition metals. Finally, the third strategy will place magnetically anisotropic moieties in the rigid coordination environments of metal-organic frameworks. In this manner it may be possible to minimize the effects of low energy lattice vibrations in causing through-barrier magnetic relaxation pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the complexities of such form-function relationships are not fully understood. This project will model a wide range of feeding patterns like those found in wild primates to better understand the relationship among feeding, mechanical food properties, and jaw form. The findings will inform adaptive scenarios about skeletal biology and evolution, including in primates and our own human lineage. This study will foster interdisciplinary approaches to research and education and involve members of under-represented groups in STEM fields. It will benefit a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students and undergraduates as well as local STEM teachers and students, all of whom will participate in lab apprenticeships, scientific presentations and outreach to the public and local institutions. Another benefit to society includes development of a novel training environment for the next generation of academic researchers and educators. Advancing knowledge about how the skeleton responds external loading patterns is also critical for hard-tissue growth and maintenance after surgical intervention, and for developing therapies to counter osteoporotic bone loss.<br/><br/>The ecomorphological importance of variation in diet-related loading patterns is a key issue in primate biology and evolution. Although jaw proportions are commonly used to infer feeding ecology, the interspecific link between diet and phenotypic diversity is variable, which poses a problem for accurate fossil reconstructions.  This project will quantify the long-term effects of variation in the modality of daily feeding patterns on jaw growth and function in a naturalistic mammalian model of dietary loading with important similarities to primates.  The investigators will assess if a saturation response is resident at more than one level of skeletal architecture and how such variation underlies skeletal performance. The ""saturation response"" occurs when bone cells become desensitized during protracted loading, which in turn inhibits hard-tissue formation despite the continued presence of routine mechanical stimuli.  Temporal variation in daily patterns of feeding activity is likely to represent an ecological factor that induces the saturation response in the oral cavity. As locomotor activity is in part dictated by patterns of feeding modality, this study may also identify the ecological correlates of osteogenic stimuli and anatomical covariation throughout the skeleton.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project involves scientists in the USA, United Kingdom, and Bolivia to collect new field measurements (gravity, ground deformation, seismic, gas flux and composition) at Uturuncu volcano, Bolivia and develop numerical models of the volcano motivated by the new data.  In particular, the new data will add to the limited understand of the background activity at restless volcanoes that is necessary to better assess the hazard of future volcanic unrest -- what is normal activity and what should cause concern?<br/><br/>There is a new emerging paradigm of a transcrustal magmatic system (TCMS) where magma storage and differentiation occurs at several locations throughout the entire crustal column. This conceptual revolution is being driven by petrological, geochronological, and geochemical studies of magma storage conditions that show (1) many large eruptions tap multiple melt sources, (2) large melt bodies are probably transient features, (3) crystals carried by the transporting melt have been stored at a range of pressures and temperatures. A key location to assess and refine models of currently active TCMS is at the APMB, where a large ground deformation pattern 150 km in diameter lasting several decades has been observed centered on Uturuncu volcano, Bolivia. By collecting and analyzing new interdisciplinary field measurements (gravity, ground deformation, seismic, gas flux and composition) and developing 3D numerical models, this proposal will answer several outstanding questions about the nature of TCMS at the APMB: 1. What is the cause of deformation in the midcrust at the APMB: a magmatic diapir, cyclic up and down movements from magma mush reorganization involving magma and/or volatiles, or something else? 2. What is the nature of a shallow-seated conductivity anomaly -- to what extent is it partial melt, a hydrothermal brine reservoir, or a mature ore body? 3.

Improved cookstoves are a prime example: while cleaner-burning stove technologies have potential health, environmental, and social benefits, efforts to disseminate these technologies have fallen short and the practice of cooking with biomass over open fires remains dominant throughout much of the developing world. The central aim of this proposal is to study how economic incentives (""prices""), social learning (""peers""), and subjective beliefs (""perceptions"") interact to influence technology adoption dynamics. We do so through a field experiment that offers new stoves at different price levels to groups of households with and without social ties to households that have already received stoves. Our results will inform and future efforts to disseminate welfare-enhancing technologies to larger population groups.<br/><br/>Our conceptual model of households' technology adoption and use decisions highlights multiple potential interactions among prices, peers, and perceptions.  Key research questions that will be addressed through our experiments include how price affects perceived quality of a new technology, how these perceptions are modified by exposure to peers that have experience with the technology, and how perceptions change over time based on one's own experience and (objective and subjective) technology performance. We implement a novel identification strategy for identifying these effects, using the preexisting and exogenously controlled distribution of free stoves in combination with uncorrelated, cluster-randomized assignment to different stove subsidy levels. By explicitly measuring perceptions in conjunction with other outcome variables in the experiment (including both surveys and physical indicators of stove use and impacts on personal exposure to pollutants), the researchers will be able to test specific models about how prices and peers (prior adoption interact in belief formation) a key issue in the technology adoption literature."

But it is critical to understand these chemical processes to make advancements in energy efficiency and pollution reduction. Few experiments exist that can get a full chemical picture of the chemistry occurring in complex reacting systems, since many of the critical molecular species formed are unstable with very short lifetimes. This work focuses on the development of new micro-reactors that can probe the chemistry on the order of microseconds to directly measure the fundamental chemistry of gas-phase reactive systems. When coupled with other diagnostics, these micro-reactors will give a nearly full chemical picture of the chemistry that occurs. If successful, these proposed micro-reactors will be a valuable research tool that will significantly enhance the ability of the field to measure the chemical products of gas-phase reactions, leading to more accurate kinetic models with wide ranging applications from engine design to air quality modeling.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposed work is to design and fabricate a novel micro-reactor for advanced chemical diagnostics for combustion and gas-phase reactive flows. While micro-reactors have been used to study pyrolysis (thermal decomposition) reactions previously, these reactors are limited in their experimental capabilities due to the reactive nature of the base material, silicon carbide (SiC) with oxygen and uncertain pressure and temperature conditions in the reactor. To directly address these issues, computational analysis will be employed to redesign the geometry of the reactor to produce stable thermodynamic fluid properties within the reactor, leading to accurate determination of reaction temperature and pressure. Then, these reactors will be fabricated using a combination of 3-D printing, casting, and micro-drilling methods. Two sets of reactors are planned: one set will be made of SiC for comparison to existing pyrolysis reactors and a second set will be made of non-reactive materials, such as quartz or sapphire, for fuel oxidation study. Performance characterization of these reactors will be completed through a series of experiments that probe the temperature and pressure behavior of fuels in a reactive environment. This powerful new instrument has the potential to help unravel still unanswered questions such as how soot is formed and destroyed, what are the dominant reaction paths for ignition, and how do pollutants interact with ozone in the upper atmosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They must be able to tell the difference between bleeding and the ordinary forces encountered as they tumble and bump along a healthy blood vessel.  This is important so that platelets don't cause a stroke by spontaneously forming blood clots in healthy vessels.  The biochemical signals governing clotting have been intensely studied, but the response of platelets to mechanical loading is largely unknown. This research will test whether force sensing is important in the 'decision' of a platelet to participate in clotting. The project will identify mechanical cues that trigger platelet responses and the internal signals that communicate the responses inside the cell.  Undergraduate and graduate biomedical engineers will perform the research.  Interactive demonstrations to K-12 students will improve the environment for younger students to participate in science education. This research will benefit society by discovering fundamental knowledge needed to develop new therapies for occlusive thrombosis (stroke) and for some bleeding disorders.<br/><br/>While mechanical sensing and mechanotransduction (conversion of mechanical to biochemical signals) processes in nucleated cells are beginning to be understood, little is known about the role and existence of mechanotransduction in regulating anucleate platelet adhesive functions in response to their hemodynamic environment. By investigating the platelet actomyosin cytoskeleton, efforts of this work will aim to examine the mechanochemical steps that support firm integrin-dependent platelet adhesion and shape change under varied hemodynamic environments using specialized microfluidic devices, high speed microscopy, single cell force measurements, and nanoscale flow quantification.  We aim to define the platelet hemodynamic forces relative to outside-in-signaling processes that trigger ligand-dependent integrin clustering, assembly of actin-based cytoskeletal complexes, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Dynamic contractile patterns associated with myosin II will be assessed to identify hemodynamic signals that lead to firm adhesion and cell detachment. Lastly, biochemical and biomechanical signals involved in these processed will be defined. This work will improve our understanding of how platelets respond to changes in flow after their initial tethering/adhesion, which is fundamental to processes that lead to normal hemostasis, relative to bleeding or thrombosis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, subduction-related processes are the subject of broad public interest and widespread investigation in the geosciences. Despite almost a century of research on the Alaska-Aleutian subduction system, several key questions remain unanswered including how and when the subduction zone was formed and to what extent the subducting Pacific plate contributes to the creation of magma generated beneath Alaska-Aleutian volcanoes. This project will allow a group of U.S. scientists from the University of South Carolina and the University of Wisconsin-Madison to precisely determine the timing of Aleutian arc formation and to characterize the products that are entering and have erupted from this active volcanic arc. This is a collaborative effort involving graduate and undergraduate students, post-docs, and researchers from Germany, Russia and the United States. All data from this project will be made available to the public. <br/><br/>The project has two broadly related themes: 1) Constraining the timing of subduction initiation and early evolution of the Aleutian arc, and 2) Characterizing subduction inputs to both the Aleutian and Kamchatka arcs and relating them to the processes controlling arc magma formation. Analyses of samples from Expedition SO249 of the German R/V Sonne as part of the German-Russian BERING project will provide constraints on the timing of Aleutian arc formation and the geochemistry of the early arc products. The project will also obtain geochemical data for north Pacific seafloor samples adjacent to the western Aleutian arc, including sites both east and west of the northern Emperor seamounts. This study will help better understand geochemical linkages between subduction input and volcanic output, and will provide new constraints and significantly improve models of arc magma genesis for the Aleutians and Kamchatka.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using this database, the project will address four research questions: 1. The effect of 80 factors on facial identification performance will be summarized. 2. The generalizability (application) of findings from eyewitness laboratory research to actual eyewitness performance will be examined by testing whether variations in research methods affect patterns of research results.  3. The implications of new witness performance measures (based on signal detection theory) will be assessed to see if they provide an adequate account of research findings as compared to prior performance measures.  4. The pattern of relationships among more than 60 indices of eyewitness performance proposed by various researchers will be investigated. It is anticipated that these measures are highly redundant and eyewitness performance can be fully reflected in a handful of readily understood measures.  <br/><br/>This project will build a comprehensive database of facial identification research that includes over 1,000 studies published in the last five decades; it will expand the database constructed by Penrod and his colleagues in 1986 and 2002. Using this database, four research questions, which are crucial for better understanding eyewitness performance, will be addressed. These questions are as follows:  First, the effect of certain independent variables in facial identification research that influence identification performance will be investigated. The accumulated database includes approximately 80 independent variables that facilitate a review of the relative contribution of each variable to identification performance. This will not only help summarize findings from previous literature on facial identification, but also suggest a direction for future research by revealing valuable variables deserving particular attention.  Second, the generalizability of findings from eyewitness laboratory research to actual eyewitness performance in the real world will be tested. Some researchers warn of the risk to the generalizability of eyewitness research results because of methodological homogeneity across studies and low external validity in research methodology. To test the generalizability of finings, this project will investigate whether research methodology (e.g., participant type, stimulus type, experimental procedures, etc.) moderates the effects of independent variables on eyewitness performance and if so, whether laboratory research under-estimates or over-estimates real-world performance.  Third, the implications of a new signal detection model for eyewitness performance during lineups and test its validity through analysis of the cumulative database will be tested. Past eyewitness research based on signal detection theory has generally focused on identification of a guilty suspect (i.e., hit rate) and an innocent suspect (i.e., false alarm rate) while ignoring filler identifications (which carry costs such as ""burning"" witnesses, missing perpetrators, and failing to clear innocent suspects). In contrast to past research, the proposed signal detection model will clarify the theoretical and practical importance of filler identifications in eyewitness performance.  Finally, the psychometric structure of indices measuring eyewitness performance with the cumulative database will be investigated. Although researchers have frequently used very few selected indices (e.g., DR, PPV and others) to measure eyewitness performance, there are more than 60 indices measuring or relevant to eyewitness performance. It is anticipated that eyewitness performance is reflected in a handful of components and that each index measures one or multiple components to a different degree.  The project aims to reveal how the various indices relate to one another, that is, reveal in accessible terms--what components of eyewitness performance these indices measure, and arrive at suggestions about which (preferably accessible) metrics best characterize which aspects of performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Far beyond providing basic communications, wireless infrastructure comprises the backbone of the control and management functions of many Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, ranging from smart home solutions to autonomous vehicles. Therefore, countless efforts have been made to ensure the efficiency and reliability of such critical infrastructure.  Against this backdrop, this project follows the same overarching theme of improving wireless infrastructure towards faster and seamless connectivity.  From a scientific perspective, the project seeks to investigate the feasibility of fundamentally transforming the technical approach to wireless network design by shifting the focus from the data networks themselves to the ambient environment.  From an industrial perspective, the project opens the way for the contribution of techniques to both improve cellular network link quality and enable co-existence of Wi-Fi technologies in dense urban deployments, where interference limits their effectiveness.  From an educational perspective, the project has the potential to change the way academia teaches the topic of wireless communications and the wireless channel to undergraduate students and graduate students alike.<br/><br/>The traditional approach to optimizing wireless networks revolves around the wireless endpoints, i.e., the transmitters and the receivers, and takes the wireless channel as a hard constraint, invoking a multitude of solutions to fully utilize that channel.  This project will instead focus on whether it is feasible to optimize the ambient wireless environment.  Instead of changing the ways in which endpoints behave, the project will explore ways of changing the perceived channel along the wireless link to create more favorable conditions for wireless communication. Specifically, the team will explore how to instrument the wireless environment with small wireless elements to effect changes in the wireless channel that a wireless receiver measures from a wireless sender.  A substrate comprising these elements is then combined with a control infrastructure that measures the channels between wireless senders and receivers in real time, and actuates the element substrate in order to effect channel variations.  As a proof of concept, the team will explore using this design to improve individual links as well as reduce interference between concurrent links.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both the American public and elected officials hold increasingly divergent and polarized views about economic and social issues. The growing divergence in social and political attitudes hinders the nation's ability to solve its pressing problems. This project examines the ways in which attitude extremetization is a result of the human capacity to share attention-the ability to sense that one is attending to information with others at the same time.  Prior research shows that sharing attention on information leads to more extreme emotions and attitudes.  It is not known why this occurs.  One possibility is that people are more likely to imagine the attitudes of those who co-attend to information with them. By imagining the attitudes of many others, one's own attitudes can grow more extreme. Another possibility is that people are more likely to pay more attention to the ideas that are the focus of shared attention. When those ideas happen to represent only one view, the view dominates one's thoughts, resulting in more extreme attitudes. It is also conceivable that attitudes grow more extreme under shared attention because of both possibilities at the same time.  Greater understanding of how attitudes grow more extreme in social groups is vital to efforts to find common ground on the social and economic challenges of today.<br/><br/>This project is an adversarial collaboration, in which scientists who disagree work together to find common ground.  Studies often claim to settle an issue, yet scientific disagreement remains due to differences in the interpretation and understanding of results. The principal investigator is collaborating with two other researchers who hold a distinct view of how shared attention renders attitudes more extreme. The researchers have agreed to work collaboratively on twelve experiments. They will consult on every aspect of study design, execution, and analysis, with the goal of reaching a joint understanding of the results.  The experiments test whether thoughts about the co-attendees' attitudes, and co-attended ideas can have independent, opposite, and combined effects on attitudinal extremetization under shared attention. Some of the studies take place in real-world contexts of an online political media channel or online open college course. The methods, materials, and settings of these studies approximate the world outside of the laboratory, increasing the likelihood that the research will support a better understanding of pressing societal concerns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most people believe they should give substantial weight to other people's welfare when making decisions about charitable donations, allocating scarce medical resources, or providing support for refugees. Yet great compassion extended towards individual victims often fades or disappears as the numbers of people in need increase. In some circumstances, emotionally appealing but normatively weak attributes may take precedence over needs. The resulting failures to help others often appear to contradict one's considered beliefs in the importance of giving them assistance. This proposal tests the hypothesis that introspection about personal beliefs regarding how humanitarian concerns should influence behavior will reduce underweighting of these concerns. We hypothesize that introspection will help people make judgments and decisions that better reflect their considered values. We propose a series of studies to test predictions derived from three basic ideas: (a) that people unknowingly weight concerns about others' welfare less than they believe they should weight those concerns, a bias in humanitarian judgment and decision making; (b) that introspection can increase awareness of the discrepancy between people's personal beliefs and their exhibited behavior; and (c) becoming aware of this discrepancy will lead people to reduce the inconsistency between their personal beliefs and behavior by increasing the weighting of others' welfare in their judgments and decisions. Understanding the role of humanitarian values in important personal and policy decisions has broad significance. Millions of lives and national and global security depend on these decisions. Do the political, social, economic, cultural, security, and humanitarian values that we assume should guide our decisions actually exist in some coherent and consistent form? If so, what are these considered values and how do we ensure that our decisions are in accord with these values? This research project aims to make a contribution toward answering these vital questions by examining the degree to which a simple introspection procedure can improve the coherence between one's own values and one?s actions in a variety of humanitarian decision contexts.<br/><br/>The proposed research yields several intellectual contributions. First, the studies advance understanding of how introspection can improve decision making, in contrast with claims in the research literature that introspection and deliberation can harm decision quality. Second, by examining people's response to introspection about normative decision processes, the proposed studies advance understanding of how people monitor and revise attribute weighting when making decisions. This enables the researchers to differentiate between introspection and deliberation, concepts that are treated similarly in the literature. Third, given that people often have clear beliefs regarding how decisions should be made in specific contexts, the proposed research advances understanding of the extent to which people fail to behave according to those beliefs and how becoming aware of personal humanitarian values can increase the correspondence between those values and actual behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nationally, 2YCs enroll over 45% of all U.S. undergraduates and serve a large number of women, minority, and first-generation college students. The 2YC teaching environment is one of the most challenging as community colleges are primarily open-access institutions that serve an extremely diverse student body; teaching loads are heavy; there is an increasing use of adjunct faculty; and support is limited for participation in faculty professional development activities. The latter issue is particularly crucial since such activities are widely recognized as the source for many innovative teaching methods shown to be critically important for improving student learning. This faculty professional development project will build a national network of self-sustaining local communities of 2YC geoscience faculty and administrators who use evidence-based strategies to improve all students' academic success and facilitate professional pathways into the STEM workforce. A program of interconnected and mutually supportive research and evaluation that is fully integrated in the project will advance knowledge and understanding of the effectiveness of a professional development model for full-time and adjunct geoscience and STEM faculty in 2YCs. <br/><br/>The project goals are to 1) implement high-impact evidence-based instructional and co-curricular practices that support the academic success of all students and promote professional pathways into geoscience; 2) build a sustainable national network of 2YC leaders who catalyze change at multiple levels from their courses to institutions in their local regions and within the community of practice; and 3) investigate models of professional development for full-time and adjunct 2YC geoscience faculty that promote the cycle of innovation, where faculty learn from the research of others, make changes in their own practice, and share what they have learned with the education community. The project's professional development program will prepare two cohorts of 2YC geoscience faculty teams to implement evidence-based instructional and co-curricular practices at their institutions. The first cohort includes twenty-four (24) full-time and adjunct faculty from seventeen (17) institutions in ten regions in the United States. National workshops, virtual professional development opportunities (e.g., journal clubs, webinars, implementation and discussion groups), and on-line resources will support faculty in implementing changes on their campus. Inclusion of administrators in the project will provide support for systemic change at each institution. The faculty teams will expand the reach of the project by engaging additional two-year and four-year institutions in their regions using a combination of workshops and follow-on activities. Virtual professional development opportunities will serve as a mechanism for increasing the reach of the project and on-line resources will provide persistent resources for the full geoscience and broader STEM communities. The project team anticipates that six-hundred (600) full-time and adjunct 2YC faculty and fifty (50) four-year college and university faculty will be engaged in professional development activities over the course of the project and that the project will impact an estimated 250,000 2YC students enrolled in geoscience courses."

Drug-addicted HIV patients often suffer from enhanced HIV-associated pathogenic consequences, such as reduced host defenses against infection and development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).  Despite being a critical problem for both science and society, the HIV infection dynamics in the context of drug abuse currently remains one of the least understood areas of HIV biology.  In the absence of such knowledge, the ability to devise effective strategies to properly manage the virus infection under drug-abuse conditioning remains one of the biggest challenging efforts.  In this project, mathematical and computational models are developed to study HIV dynamics in the circulation and in the brain under drug-abuse conditioning, such as the presence of morphine within the host.  Further complex models are developed to study the effects of pharmacodynamic properties of morphine on HIV infection in the circulation and in the brain.  The developed models are also used for formulating optimal control problems in order to identify ideal antiretroviral treatment as pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-infected drug abusers.  In addition to improving our current knowledge of HIV dynamics, pathogenesis and development of HAND under conditioning of drugs of abuse, this research endures a significant positive and practical impact on developing therapies and vaccines to control the burden of HIV among drug abusers.   <br/><br/>This project produces autonomous models of the HIV dynamics under conditioning of drugs of abuse in the circulation and in the brain, as well as nonautonomous models incorporating the effects of pharmacodynamic properties of drugs of abuse on HIV infection dynamics.  The models are parameterized using experimental data from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections of morphine-addicted macaques (animal model of HIV).  The developed models are extensively analyzed using the tools of mathematical modeling, dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, theory of periodic systems, stability and persistence theory, as well as statistical and numerical methods. Mathematical challenges anticipated in this research offer opportunities to develop new mathematical theories that advance the field of applied differential equations and optimal control theory.  Results, including optimal antiretroviral therapy treatment protocols, help healthcare professionals to mitigate burdens from HIV infection and HAND in drug abusers, thereby, providing the quality of life to drug-addicted HIV infected patients and their families.  In addition, this project provides extensive interdisciplinary collaborative research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from mathematics and biology departments, as well as the School of Pharmacy at University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC).  The research opportunities will be especially extended to a variety of undergraduate research programs that place priority on involving underrepresented students, particularly, undergraduate rural students from Missouri and Kansas.

The FAD program also acts as a funding catalyst, helping young researchers develop their projects to the point where they can secure additional outside support. Recent FAD awardees reported receiving nearly $5.00 in additional funding for every dollar they received from FAD. <br/><br/>The Fund for the Advancement of the Discipline (FAD) at the American Sociological Association (ASA) advances sociology and nurtures the development of scientific knowledge by supporting small, groundbreaking research initiatives and conferences that foster new research agendas and networks.  FAD also nurtures the scientific potential of researchers who might have difficulty securing funding from other sources. FAD has been extremely successful in this regard, with up to half of all awards going to early career researchers and those employed outside of research extensive institutions. The program fosters the development of publications, educational resources, intellectual debates and public conversations that stimulate new lines of scientific inquiry. Awards are based on a merit review system that emphasizes innovativeness and the promise of the research, feasibility and adequacy of project design, and plans for data analysis and public dissemination of results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We don't understand these mechanical effects enough, however, to explain many of the important questions in multicellular biology, tissue development, and disease progression that we already know are dependent on intercellular forces. Maintenance and turnover of the attachments between cells (adhesions) is critical to how cells can form a barrier between different parts of organs.  Adhesion is important to wound healing, and also disruption of cell-cell adhesion is a precursor to cancer metastasis. Organ formation, wound healing and cancer metastasis involve large deformations and force generation, yet the mechanisms underlying the dynamic regulation of cell adhesions, how cells slide or shear past one another, or how cell-cell adhesions function under mechanical loading are not yet understood. The research goal is to understand how tissues distribute and respond to shear force transmitted through cell-cell junctions.  The project will test how shear modifies collective cell behavior and reorganization of cellular architecture. Such changes are coupled to the biomechanical properties of cells and ultimately regulate tissue integrity, barrier functions and homeostasis.  The research results will be incorporated into modules for teaching basic Engineering and Biology courses, and the development of undergraduate research experiences within our laboratories. The PIs actively participate in community outreach and research experiences for teachers and under-represented students.<br/><br/>This research combines custom micro-fabricated cell culture platforms with force-sensing and displacement-actuation with mechanical analyses and cell biological methods such as pharmacological inhibitors and knockout cell lines. We study how externally applied and cell-generated forces dynamically modify collective cell behavior in response to shear disruption. Physiological development exhibits slow deformations while injury occurs on a faster timescale, thus we test the idea that collective cell mechanoresponse depends not only on load and tissue rigidity, but also on the applied loading rate. We will test the idea that dynamic cell-cell adhesion is governed by protein catch bonds with force- and rate-dependence. This work will deliver new platform technologies for mechanical manipulation and observation of epithelial tissues and test new models of force transfer and cell-cell communications across cell-cell adhesions and the cytoskeleton. Insights gained in this work will increase our understanding of epithelial homeostasis which underlies normal barrier function in each organ system."

The investigators are exploring a possible modification that could enhance the sensitivity of this technique by many orders of magnitude, thus improving MRI while also contributing to the improvement of technologies for visualizing other types of systems. The research is exploring the use of a special form of hydrogen known as parahydrogen that has been shown to enhance an NMR signal. The work is bringing a variety of techniques to bear on the task of understanding how this special form of hydrogen works in order to develop more accurate and sensitive imaging methods. The work is having a broad impact on the development of new scientific instruments that will find applications in a wide variety of fields from medicine to chemical manufacturing. It is having a further broad impact by bringing scientists together across borders to work on problems of mutual global interest. This project is contributing to the training of the next generation of scientists by providing opportunities for students at all levels to participate in a highly interdisciplinary, multi-site training environment. Specifically, students at the US sites are able to visit and carry out research projects at the international collaborator's site in Novosibirsk, one of Asia's most important research hubs.<br/><br/>The overall objective is to develop new catalytic materials and approaches that can dramatically improve the applicability of parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) techniques. Low detection sensitivity remains an Achilles Heel of many conventional methods such as NMR and MRI. However, the pure anti-phase spin order of parahydrogen (pH2) can be exploited to achieve highly non-equilibrium nuclear spin population distributions (""polarizations"") in certain types of molecules, thereby enabling the enhancement of NMR/MRI detection sensitivity by orders of magnitude. More specifically, these efforts concern the synthesis, evaluation, and NMR demonstration of: 1) new heterogeneous catalysts for traditional PHIP (which involves the hydrogenation of unsaturated moieties with pH2); and 2) new homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for SABRE (signal amplification by reversible exchange - a technique where spin order is transferred from pH2 to molecules without requiring irreversible chemical change). New approaches exploiting in situ high-field SABRE are also under study. Additionally, these experiments are supported by the construction of an automated portable HET-PHIP/SABRE polarizer with in situ MR detection and automated pH2 generation. These research efforts endeavor to provide greater insight into current limitations for key PHIP approaches, while working to dramatically improve their utility."

Workshop outcomes will be documented and disseminated as a workshop report and peer-reviewed publications.<br/><br/>This award partially supports the participation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early career faculty, and women and under-represented minorities in a workshop on representations of manufacturing processes. The workshop focuses on research in modeling of unit manufacturing processes for discrete, batch, and continuous methods; and for conventional, nanometer, and additive manufacturing scales. Methodologies are applicable in fields such as mechanical, electrical, chemical, nuclear, biochemical, and biological. Sustainability requires a balance of competing objectives, such as cost, time, and environmental and social considerations. The use of these models for system-level sustainability performance is complicated due to uncertain emergent properties. However, these models are vital to comparing alternative designs of products and production systems. Acquiring and exchanging information on manufacturing processes can lead to consistent process characterization and can help establish a consolidated repository of process models for reuse across advanced manufacturing domains. Improved process modeling and model integration ensures more effective communication of computational analytics and sharing of sustainability performance data. Engaging industrial and academic researchers in discussing their work, sharing best practices, revealing gaps in research and practice is important in developing new research directions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

About 700,000 people die annually in US hospitals and 16% of them were diagnosed with sepsis (including a high prevalence of severe sepsis with major  complication). In addition to being deadly, sepsis is the most expensive condition associated with in-hospital stay, resulting in a 75% longer stay than any other condition.  The total burden of sepsis to the US healthcare system is estimated to be $20.3 billion, most of which is paid by Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, in June 2015 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that sepsis accounted for over $7 billion in Medicare payments (second only to major joint replacement), a close to 10% increase from the previous year.  This pervasive drain on health care resources is due, in part, to difficulties in diagnosis and delayed treatment. For example, every one hour delay in treatment of severe sepsis/shock with antibiotics decreases a patient's survival probability by 10%. Many of these deaths could have been averted or postponed if a better system of care was in place. The goal of this research is to overcome these barriers by integrating electronic health records (EHR) and clinical expertise to provide an evidence-based framework to diagnose and accurately risk-stratify patients within the sepsis spectrum, and develop and validate intervention policies that inform sepsis treatment decisions.  The  project to bring together health care providers, researchers, educators, and students to add value to patient care by integrating machine learning, decision analytical models, human factors analysis, as well as system and process modeling to advance scientific knowledge, predict sepsis, and prevent sepsis-related health deterioration. In addition to the societal impact that clinical translation of these findings may bring, the project will provide engineering and computer science students and health services researchers with cross-disciplinary educational experience.<br/><br/>The proposed research will apply engineering and computer science methodologies to analyze patient level EHR across two large scale health care facilities, Mayo Clinic Rochester and Christiana Care Health System and to inform clinical decision making for sepsis. The multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration will enable the development of health care solutions for sepsis by describing and accurately risk-stratifying hospitalized patients, and developing decision analytical models to personalize and inform diagnostic and treatment decisions considering patient outcomes and response implications. The Sepsis Early Prediction Support Implementation System (S.E.P.S.I.S.) project aims will be to: 1) Develop data-driven models to classify patients according to their clinical progression to diagnose sepsis and predict risk of deterioration, thus informing therapeutic actions. 2) Develop personalized intervention policies for patients within the sepsis spectrum.  3) Develop decision support systems (DSS) for personalized interventions focusing on resource implications and usability within a real hospital setting. The team will 1) identify important factors that uncover patient profiles based on Bayesian exponential family principal components analysis; 2) develop hidden Markov models (HMMs) and input-output HMMs to identify clusters of patients with similar progression patterns within the sepsis spectrum; 3) provide an analytical framework to support sepsis staging in clinical practice using bilevel optimization. They will 1) predict short- and long-term individual patient outcomes using multivariate statistical models and simulation; 2) develop semi-Markov decision process and partially observable semi-Markov decision process models to identify timing of therapeutic actions and diagnostic tests. Furthermore, the team will 1) predict demand for resources and develop and validate a hybrid mixed integer programming and queueing model to optimize system level allocations; 2) utilize human factors analysis and usability testing to assess the implementation of the DSS."

Both technical and conceptual limits have prevented the collection and analysis of rich empirical datasets with high temporal frequency over large spatial extents necessary to investigate how changes to seasonal precipitation patterns are affecting food security.  This research project will transform both methodological and conceptual frameworks for assessing the sustainability of dryland agricultural systems.  The research will bring new understanding of how dryland farmers adapt to within-season variability in climate and how those adaptations affect their current and future resilience to climate variability and climate change.  Project findings will improve forecast models used to monitor and predict the sustainability of water-dependent agricultural systems.  By marrying the simple idea of cell phone adoption with state-of-art research in data science, crop prediction, and environmental/social monitoring, the project will advance and accelerate scientific understanding of an important global sustainability problem.<br/><br/>This project will focus on characterizing the nature and impact of intra-seasonal smallholder decision making on adaptation to climate variability in semi-arid agricultural systems. Specifically, the research addresses three critical research questions: (1) How do intra-seasonal dynamics of both the environment and social systems shape farmer adaptive capacity? (2) To what extent does intra-seasonal decision making enable farmers to adapt to climate uncertainty? and (3) How can intra-seasonal data improve the ability to model, predict, and improve adaptation to climate variability in ways that enhance food security?  The research team will integrate physical models of hydrological and agricultural dynamics with real-time environmental data and weekly farmer decision making in individual fields.  These real-time data are obtained from previously-developed novel cellular-based environmental sensing pods coupled to real-time reports of farmer decision making submitted via cell phones.  The team will use a combination of environmental and social data to develop a suite of modeling tools for understanding how climate variability impacts the sustainability of agricultural systems in the study regions.  The research team also will develop modeling tools for improved forecasts of food security capable of producing new understandings of the intra-seasonal dynamics of both social and environmental processes. Although the test bed for this research is the Southern Province of Zambia and portions of the Rift Valley and Central Provinces of Kenya centered around the Laikipia District, the results may well be broadly applicable to other semi-arid and arid regions of the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, until now, it has not been possible to monitor, in real time and over long periods of time, the fluids venting from seafloor hydrothermal vents even though these fluids carry a significant amount of internal geothermal heat from deep in the ocean crust to the seafloor. This project overcomes this problem by installing newly tested instrumentation, a Cabled Observatory Vent Imaging Sonar system, capable of long term monitoring of hydrothermal vent fluid fluxes, on the National Science Foundation's recently completed Ocean Observing Initiative's cabled observatory at the ASHES hydrothermal field in the caldera of Axial Volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. This sonar system is designed for imaging hydrothermal discharge and the measuring heat transferred by that discharge into the ocean from the subseafloor.  One goal of the work is to continue improving the system and developing it into a reliable tool for long-term repeated quantification of hydrothermal activity (fluid flow and heat transport) using acoustic sensing. The resulting heat transport measurements will enable investigation of the connections between the volcanic system, which supplies heat to the surrounding rock; subsurface fluid flow processes; and the biological systems that depend on the reduced chemical species that emanate from the hydrothermal system as a result of the leaching of metals and other compounds from water-rock interaction in the subsurface. This second deployment of the cabled sonar system will test its ability to measure and couple discharge rates and heat transport. Broader impacts of the work include increasing infrastructure for science and applications that extend to monitoring and measuring the discharge rates of methane at methane seeps and/or oil at oil-well head blowouts such as Deep Water Horizon. The work will also result in the training of undergraduates and the integration of education and research. Results will also be disseminated to the public via lectures and media outlets. <br/><br/>One of the most important field measurements needed for the study of coupled geo-bio-hydrothermal systems is heat flux. This is a fundamental property of seafloor hydrothermal systems. It connects its driving force (i.e., sub-seafloor heat sources such as volcanic magma or serpentinization) to the systems it impacts, such as the flux of chemicals into the ocean. It also exerts controls on the subsurface and surface biosphere. Previous attempts to adequately measure seafloor hydrothermal heat flux have been unable to measure it with the combined spatial/temporal coverage and resolution necessary to resolve the dynamics of venting.  The installation of the recently developed and tested sonar system that will be installed on the National Science Foundation's recently commissioned Ocean Observatory Initiative cabled array at the ASHES hydrothermal vent field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge will enable the monitoring and quantification of  hydrothermal discharge and the heat transferred by it from rocks below the seafloor to the ocean. The sonar system is able to make synoptic measurements across a significant areal extent of the vent field and can collect and transmit data for periods of up to several years. This greatly reduces the need for extrapolation in the data. In addition to the monitoring, this research will exploit an innovative method for inversion of acoustic data to estimate the heat flux of diffuse-flow around the vents using a newly developed acoustic method.  Deployment of the instrument will be for 4 years.  It will be combined with ground-truth measurements to establish the accuracy of the acoustic results in terms of flow rates for focused and diffuse flow and for temperature/heat flux. The resulting time series for heat flux from focused and diffuse sources has a broad range of applicability. In particular, heat flux values and variations have implications for the dynamics of hydrothermal venting at ASHES and its connections with seismicity, magma supply, crustal cooling, and basalt-water interactions. It also exerts influence on heat and chemical changes in the ocean, energy and nutritive supplies to seafloor ecosystems; and the extent and nature of the subsurface biosphere."

Cloud services are well-positioned to help application providers reduce users' latency by serving users from hundreds of locations across the world that have rich and diverse Internet connectivity to users' networks. However, due to various sources of inefficiency, web service performance in practice often falls well short of the potential that cloud-based deployments offer. For example, many users are incorrectly served from distant servers. Even when served from a nearby server, performance can be degraded due to circuitous routing or congestion. These suboptimal outcomes stem from the limited interface between applications and cloud providers to express goals and achieve outcomes, and often a mismatch in their goals.<br/><br/>This project pursues a multi-pronged cross-layer approach to enable cloud services to optimize the performance offered by web services they host. First, the researchers will develop a new approach for directing clients to nearby servers, combining the strengths of existing approaches in order to overcome their weaknesses. Part of this research will also include an investigation of how to jointly optimize client-to-server redirection and back-end data placement in order to satisfy end-to-end performance objectives. Second, this project will involve large-scale studies of web transport performance and anomalies in order to inform the design of low-latency transport protocols. Lastly, the researchers will design a system to allow cloud tenants to take advantage of the rich interdomain routing available to cloud providers, in order to best balance diverse performance and cost constraints. Thus, this project will synthesize various inter-dependent aspects of running a high performance web service.<br/><br/>The researchers will collaborate with the providers of popular cloud services to have a transformative effect on industrial practice and enable real-world impact. By developing solutions for cloud providers to deploy for all applications they host, this project will benefit application providers without them having to build and deploy these solutions themselves.

Available vantage points provide little visibility into how the networks interconnect, making it difficult to assess the resilience and performance of existing paths. On top of this limited visibility, researchers lack means to experiment with alternate paths.<br/><br/>The infrastructure developed by this project will allow researchers and network operators to observe Internet paths and to experiment with alternate approaches to routing. The infrastructure consists of two synergistic tools: Transit Portal allows an experimenter to make route announcements that influence current routing, and Reverse Traceroute allows the experimenter to measure the resulting paths. The PIs have used early versions of the infrastructure to improve Internet performance, reliability, and diagnosis. <br/><br/>The project opens the infrastructure to use by the networking community and in classrooms, providing a basis for understanding and improving the Internet. The key components are 1) increasing the number of Transit Portal sites; 2) adding support for Transit Portal experiments that join fully emulated networks to the actual Internet; 3) upgrading and hardening the Reverse Traceroute code so that it is useable by the broader community; and 4) improving experiment workflow by scheduling and reusing measurements more efficiently."

This is a field that deals with the study of algebraic varieties: geometric objects given as the solutions of a system of polynomial equations. For example, the solution set of a single polynomial equation in two variables can be geometrically realized as a curve in the plane (e.g., a parabola y=x^2). One important aspect is to understand the local picture of these solution sets, which has applications in many sciences and engineering. For example, the parabola is smooth (meaning that locally it looks like a line) while the curve defined by y^2=x^3 is smooth except at the origin, where it is a cusp. The singular or non-smooth points of an algebraic variety have rich and subtle local structure, and detailing their properties is a crucial part of many investigations. The projects that will be explored are focused on the local properties of algebraic varieties, such as their local intersection numbers and the multiplicities (which is a measure of how bad the singular points are). Several of the questions under study are longstanding and of fundamental importance. <br/><br/>This project investigates several longstanding open questions in commutative algebra from new perspectives. One is to attack Serre's conjecture on positivity of intersection multiplicities and Hochster's direct summand conjecture using a new notion called lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences of modules, whose existence will establish both conjectures. Another is to attack Lech's conjecture on Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities using advances in positive characteristic methods. The investigator recently settled this conjecture in dimension three in equal characteristic (the conjecture was previously known only in dimension less than or equal to two). The goal here is to improve the methods and to seek solutions in higher dimension. Other research projects include studying singularities in positive characteristic, especially investigating their behavior under deformation, under passing to a generic linkage, and their connections with F-module and D-module theory. A crucial technique to be employed is the Frobenius structures on local cohomology modules."

Early detection of sea level acceleration, necessary for adaptation efforts, depends on an improved understanding of multidecadal sea level changes. This study consists of a detailed investigation of multidecadal sea level changes using sea level data, ocean and climate models, atmospheric reanalyses, vertical land motion, and a hierarchical Bayesian data-assimilation approach.  An outcome of this study will be an enhanced, value-added sea level dataset based on the hierarchical Bayesian model approach, which will complement the available sea level estimates from altimetry, tide gauges, and ocean circulation models. These sea level fields from the Bayesian model solution will be made freely and publicly accessible and available. With their estimates of uncertainty, these fields would be suited for use in state estimation efforts on century time scales. This project is a partnership between academia and industry and would also support an early career scientist.<br/><br/>The main objectives of this project include: reconstructing regional maps and global time series of sea level going back two centuries; elucidating roles of internal versus external forcing of global mean multidecadal sea level change; diagnosing the impacts of static and dynamic processes on multidecadal regional sea level changes; and evaluating the veracity of climate models. The outcomes will fill basic knowledge gaps, improving understanding of ocean circulation and climate change.  To increase basic knowledge of ocean circulation and climate change, and to cope with difficulties related to the sparseness of sea level data in space and time, a hierarchical Bayesian model will be brought to bear on extant datasets (altimetry, tide gauge, vertical land motion), giving observation-based constraints on sea level behavior over the last two centuries. Exploration of the underlying ocean dynamics based on hierarchical Bayesian model solutions will elucidate the physical drivers and space-time scales of multidecadal sea level changes and provide a basis to evaluate climate models."

Its unpredictable performance, energy, and cost benefits can adversely affect productivity, efficiency, and profit in data centers. Though promising, this technical transition can fundamentally change the decades-long memory and storage system design assumptions and introduce critical design challenges. For example, new performance landscape can change the energy efficiency model of data centers and break the existing load balance across various system resources; traditional data reliability schemes can become suboptimal due to the discrepant failure patterns and reliability issues of new memory technologies; current applications and system software may not fully exploit the benefits offered by persistent memory. <br/><br/>This research focuses on enhancing the performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability of data center storage system by fully exploiting the potential of persistent memory. The central approach is to rethink data center architecture design strategies and memory/storage stack management, making them persistent memory aware. The project devises fundamental techniques in efficiency modeling, load balancing of critical system resources, and low-cost reliability guarantee across single server memory/storage stack and distributed storage systems. The project also enhances a set of key data center applications by leveraging persistent memory.

At present, approximately 4.7 million people in the United States would benefit from an active lower-limb exoskeleton due to the effects of stroke, polio, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and cerebral palsy, and by 2050 an estimated 1.5 million people in the United States will be living with a major lower-limb amputation.  Yet current wearable robotic devices do not address this growing population's needs since they are bulky, heavy, noisy, and require large batteries for even short duration use, while implementing predominately hierarchical control algorithms.  Impeding innovation in this domain is the expensive and slow traditional design-build-test approach that ignores the tight coupling between hardware specifications and control algorithm performance.  The vision of this work is to provide a methodology---inspired by advancements in robotic locomotion---that allows lower-limb prostheses and exoskeletons to meet real-world requirements through the co-design of the electromechanical and feedback systems.  The transformative nature of this work, therefore, stems from its ability to realize wearable robots that synergize with humans to achieve increased mobility, providing a template for the growing robotic assistive device industry and potentially improving the quality of life of millions.  <br/><br/>To realize the vision of this work, the overarching research goal is to create a new unified control and design framework that will allow for the efficient and stable locomotion of robots, prostheses, and exoskeletons.

The resulting framework will be utilized via control-in-the-loop mechanical design of prostheses and exoskeletons with stringent design requirements, tested experimentally on a novel humanoid robot, and clinically evaluated through human subject trials.  This work is, therefore, guided by the following specific goals:  (1) develop a unified online optimization-based control framework for (wearable) robotic locomotion that efficiently mediates stability, safety and force constraints, (2) create a feedback loop between formal control synthesis and the mechanical design of wearable robots that satisfy stringent performance requirements,  (3) accelerate clinical testing by translating controllers formally and experimentally from bipedal humanoid robots to prostheses and exoskeletons.  As a result of these research goals, this work has the potential to create the next generation of robotic systems that enable stable, safe and efficient human mobility."

Informal STEM Learning Sites (ISLS) provide opportunities for building interest and engagement in the STEM fields through a multitude of avenues, including the programming that they provide for youth, particularly teens. Frequently, ISLS provide opportunities to participate in volunteer programs, internships or work, which allow teens both to learn relevant STEM knowledge as well as to share that knowledge with others through opportunities to serve as youth educators. While youth educator programs provide rich contexts for teens  to engage as both learners and teachers in these informal STEM environments, research to date has not yet identified the relationship between serving as youth educators and STEM engagement.  Thus, the goal of this project is to document the impact of youth educators on visitor learning in ISLS and to identify best practices for implementing youth educator programs. The project studies STEM interests and engagement in the youth participants and the visitors that they interact with at six different ISLS in the US and UK.  This project is funded through Science Learning+, which is an international partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Wellcome Trust with the UK Economic and Social Research Council. The goal of this joint funding effort is to make transformational steps toward improving the knowledge base and practices of informal STEM experiences. Within NSF, Science Learning+ is part of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that seeks to enhance learning in informal environments and to broaden access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences.  <br/><br/>This project examines youth educator experiences related to STEM identity, educational aspirations, and motivation. The project also identifies outcomes that the youth educators have on visitors to ISLS in terms of knowledge, interest, and engagement in STEM. The specific aims are: 1) Outcomes for Teens - To measure the longitudinal impact of participation in an extended youth educator experience in an ISLS; 2) Outcomes for Visitors - To compare visitor engagement with and learning from exhibits in ISLS when they interact with a youth educator, relative to outcomes of interacting with an adult educator or no educator; and 3) Outcomes Across Demographics and STEM Sites - To examine differences in visitor engagement based on participant characteristics such as socio-economic status (SES), age, gender, and ethnicity and to compare outcomes of youth educator experiences across different types of ISLS. This research, which draws on expectancy value theory and social cognitive theory, will follow youth participants longitudinally over the course of 5 years and use latent variable analyses to understand the impact on the youth educators as well as the visitors with whom they interact.  Importantly, the results of this research will be used to develop best practices for implementing youth educator programs in ISLS and the results will be disseminated to both academic and practice-based communities.   <br/><br/>This project has clear and measurable broader impacts in a variety of ways. First, the project provides guidance to improve programming for youth in ISLS, including both the sites involved directly in the research and to the larger community of ISLS through evaluation, development, and dissemination of best practices. Additionally, this project provides rigorous, research-based evidence to identify and describe the outcomes of youth educator programs. This study directly benefits the participants of the research, both the visiting public and the youth educators, through opportunities to engage with science. The findings speak to issues of access and inclusivity in ISLS, providing insight into how to design environments that are welcoming and accessible for diverse groups of learners. Finally, this project provides evidence for best practices for ISLS in developing programs for youth that will lead to interest in and pursuit of STEM careers by members of underrepresented groups."

By leveraging the principal investigator's (PI's) expertise in electrochemistry, membrane separations, and colloidal science, this project will advance the science and engineering of water treatment processes with a clear improvement over existing best practices. This project embodies the PI's goal of ensuring safe and plentiful water resources in a rapidly changing global environment by applying innovative technological solution. <br/><br/>Electrochemical reactions have the potential to solve many of the most persistent challenges facing membrane-based water treatment processes. These challenges can be summarized as: 1) the sensitivity of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes to oxidizing chemicals, such as chlorine, which significantly complicates biofilm management and membrane cleaning operations, and, 2) membrane fouling in in ultrafiltration and membrane distillation processes. This project will address both of these problems by applying electrochemical methods. The PI will use electropolymerization to fabricate a new generation of chlorine-resistant, smooth nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes, and electro-polymerize conducting polymers onto porous carbon nanotubes to form electroactive ultrafiltration and membrane distillation membrane materials that are resistant to electrocorrosion. The project is based on the central hypotheses that that electropolymerized polymeric films can maintain the chemical structures and transport properties critical to membrane separation processes while providing improved functionalities. The first major objective of the project is to fabricate, characterize, and test an electropolymerized material that combines the transport properties critical to nanofiltration and reverse osmosis processes with chlorine-resistance and a smooth surface. This objective will be pursued by developing appropriate electrically conducting substrates, identifying potential monomers, testing/characterizing the electropolymerized materials, and modeling the resulting polymeric material. The second major objective is to form electrically conducting ultrafiltration and membrane distillation membrane materials that can be used as anodes at high electrical potentials without suffering from electro-corrosion, and that can participate in electrooxidation reactions. This objective will be pursued by electropolymerizing conducting polymers onto carbon nanotubes substrates, characterizing the electrochemical, chemical and physical properties of the composite material, and describing the transport properties of the membrane materials. Finally, all the membranes will be tested for their anti-fouling properties using model organic and inorganic foulants. Electropolymerized chlorine-resistant nanofiltration and reverse osmosis materials and electro-corrosion resistant conducting membranes represent an advancement in membrane-based water treatment processes. They have potential applications in wastewater reuse, seawater desalination, and groundwater treatment. The project will develop fundamental understanding of the electrochemical reactions taking place during the fabrication of the new reverse osmosis material and during the electrochemical reduction of nitrate. The research plan directly addresses the NSF Environmental Engineering Program's emphasis on enhancing the availability of high quality water supplies. The focus of the education plan is to provide disabled military veterans with internships in order to attract/maintain them in STEM fields  Additionally, the PI works at a Hispanic-serving institution and collaborates with a community college that serves Hispanics."

Examples include traffic incidents (Waze), restaurant reviews (Yelp, FourSquare), anonymous social networks (Whisper, Yik Yak), and even dating (Tinder, Bumble).  Unfortunately, new threats can compromise and manipulate these communities, using lightweight software to mimic mobile devices.  The resesarchers have shown how attackers can eavesdrop on mobile network traffic, learn their patterns, and write software to emulate mobile devices running the application. This amplifies existing attacks by multiple orders of magnitude, and allows attackers with limited resources to overwhelm mobile communities using millions of emulated devices under their control. These devices are difficult to detect, and completely cripple entire mobile systems, or manipulate them for the attacker's personal gain.  Preliminary work showed that such an attack on Waze, Google's crowdsourced traffic navigation application, enabled fine grained GPS-level tracking of large user populations. Similar vulnerabilities apply to Yelp, Tinder, Uber, and others, with consequences ranging from manipulating/censoring content, theft of monetary incentives, to completely crippling the service.<br/><br/>The work described in this proposal seeks a better understanding of the threat of software-emulated devices to mobile communities, and explores systematic defenses against them. The researchers will develop defenses that detect large-scale attacks and limit their impact to that of single misbehaving devices, using three orthogonal approaches: a) a centralized infrastructure-based solution, that uses hidden patterns in aggregate user data to authenticate mobile devices; b) hardware solutions that extracts device-specific sensor data using platform APIs, and compares them to known models of hardware data models; and c) application-level solutions that use unsupervised learning to automatically detect similarity clusters in devices, based on analysis of user behavior (clickstreams) and physical mobility trace."

Most applications of networks rely crucially on comparing networks, for example to detect changes in one network across time, to categorize or classify multiple networks of similar types, or to build analogies across fields by comparing networks of different origins. The question of how to compare two networks in a principled way, without relying on the ad hoc choice of statistics used by many current comparison methods, is key to the foundations of network science. This project will bring to bear new ideas from mathematics, computer science, and statistical physics on the problem of principled, structural comparison of networks. Through pre-existing collaborations, the PIs will leverage these new comparison methods to address questions in several different areas, for example, about: how food webs change across gradients like latitude, altitude, and temperature,morphological growth patterns of bacterial colonies, the evolution of human culture and communities, and links between socio-economic indicators and epidemiology.<br/><br/><br/>Our project will develop new rigorous and principled methods of comparing the structure of complex networks. The methods to be pursued aim to get away from single-scale summary statistics; to break new ground, we must think in terms of structural distance rather than statistical inference. In combination with tools from machine learning, such structural comparison methods are an important step towards defining the ""space of real-world networks"", which could serve as a more rigorous basis for a theory of complex networks. These methods have four advantageous features: (1) they systematically consider multiple scales of network organization, (2) they do not depend on an identification of the nodes of the two networks beforehand, (3) they can compare networks of different sizes, and (4) they are not dependent on any particular generative model of network growth. Very few, if any, of the existing network comparison methods have all of these features, and those that do exist have not been extensively developed. These features enable many new applications in a range of areas, including ecology, microbiology, cultural evolution, and epidemiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on providing theoretical insights as well as designing practical algorithms for the optimal provisioning of a cloud-based radio access network. Fundamental computational issues of key cross-network resource management tasks will be investigated, revealing their intrinsic complexity. Moreover, practical schemes capable of optimally utilizing resources across networks will be developed, using cross-network optimization formulations. These algorithms will be optimized to fully exploit the computational resources offered by the cloud centers, addressing key issues such as parallel/distributed implementation, asynchronous computation, and load balancing. The goal is to determine how computational resources should be deployed through the proposed cross-network framework to dramatically improve the performance of a cloud-based radio access network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the problem can be simplified by focusing on one salient aspect of the phenomenon and ignoring the others. The ""model equations"" that result from this process are generally easier to handle than the original equation. However, model equations are often derived using heuristic arguments, and attempts to confirm the accuracy of the models numerically can be inconclusive. One aim of this research project is to mathematically justify that model equations accurately describe the full equation. In some cases, analysis of solutions to such simplified model equations remains difficult, even to the point where basic facts about the behavior of such model equations (such as whether they can be solved for all times) are not known. A good theoretical understanding of these fundamental properties is important for providing confidence that the model in question is accurate. This project will explore ways in which an equation interacts with its model equations and vice versa, with the goals of a better understanding of both problems. <br/><br/>This project deals with research involving partial differential equations (PDEs), specifically the relationship between evolution PDEs and model equations derived from them by asymptotic expansion methods. The first and most fundamental question of study from a mathematical standpoint is rigorous justification: to give a mathematical proof that a model equation derived from a formal argument provides a good approximation to the original PDE in the appropriate regime. This entails providing quantitative bounds on the errors incurred in approximation. Since such models often involve small parameters, one must have a good understanding of the well-posedness of the underlying problem for large initial data and over long time scales, both of which involve technical challenges. The other aspect of this project is to explore the idea of constructing, for a given equation known to arise from such a modeling procedure, an artificial equation constructed to force existence of the model equation for all time. This provides a new method for demonstrating global existence of solutions to equations which may be lacking structure for applying existing techniques, such as a coercive conserved energy. The first step is to demonstrate that this method applies in the context of nonlinear Schrodinger equations, which is one of the fundamental equations of mathematical physics. This project aims also to generalize the method to analyze other important model equations in which conserved quantities are either absent or otherwise unsuitable for use. A famous example of such an obstacle is the ""super-criticality barrier"" that prevents the establishment of global existence in a wide variety of problems."

A major challenge associated with big data is to enable statistical analysis of complex data sets, without compromising the privacy of the individuals whose data they contain. Addressing this challenge is both necessary, since access to many data sources is restricted due to privacy concerns, and difficult, as numerous attacks on supposedly anonymized data demonstrate.  This project will investigate the design and limitations of algorithms for the private, continual analysis of time-varying data sets.  That is, it will study algorithms that release information about a data set as it is collected (say, in the form of a data stream from the web, or a long-term sociological study). The research will advance the state of the art in the private analysis of ""big"" -- massive, complex, time-varying -- data. If successful, the project will provide enabling technologies that facilitate research in areas where access to sensitive data is limited by confidentiality concerns.<br/><br/>The project will focus on the design of algorithms that satisfy differential privacy -- a rigorous notion of privacy that is widely studied in computer science and related fields. The privacy implications of sequential releases are still poorly understood, and relatively few of the algorithms developed in the extensive recent literature on private data analysis allow for sequential releases with high accuracy. The two major thrusts of the project are (1) algorithms for the ""continual release"" model, and (2) algorithms for the ""local"" model, which offers even stronger privacy guarantees. The work will provide novel algorithmic design techniques and understanding of complexity-theoretic limitations of algorithms for these models. The research will entail advances in related areas such as learning theory, statistical inference and streaming algorithms. The project will also include educational, outreach and work-force training activities designed to broaden the impact of the research.<br/><br/>For further information see the project web site at: http://www.cse.psu.edu/~asmith/projects/continual/"

Realizing this vision is contingent upon enabling existing community infrastructure such as transportation, communications, and energy systems, to seamlessly integrate sustainable components such as renewable sources, smart sensors, and electric vehicles. Such an integration will ensure that tomorrow's communities are truly sustainable and connected by exhibiting desirable qualities that include: a) zero energy, in that they are self-sufficient in their energy production, b) zero outage, in that communication links across the community are ultra-reliable and experience significantly low interruption, and c) zero congestion, in that the traffic congestion is minimized across the community. With this overarching vision, the goal of this project is to develop a new planning framework for smart, connected and sustainable communities that allows meeting such zero-energy, zero-outage, and zero-congestions goals by optimally deciding on how, when, and where to deploy or upgrade a community's infrastructure. These decisions will be driven by massive volumes of community data, stemming from multiple sources that can include mobility, energy, traffic, communication demands, and other socio-technological information, to make informed decisions on how to gradually and organically transform a community into a fully sustainable and truly connected environment.  The scale and heterogeneity of this problem necessitates the need for innovation in the tools used to process, analyze, and visualize heterogeneous data, as well as the data-aware metrics used to monitor the performance of this community infrastructure. One key element of this research is creation of a virtual testbed that can accurately reconstruct, simulate, and evaluate the theoretical framework by leveraging real-world big data sets from Virginia Tech and a zero-energy community in Florida as well as other sources, such as the DOE.   The testbed is intended to be open access and will be able to support both research at host institution as well as other users requiring non-proprietary multi-domain open-data sets.  The holistic nature of this research is thus expected to catalyze the global deployment of sustainable and connected communities. The proposed research will be complemented by a smart community big data challenge event that will enable broad community participation. The educational plan includes new big data-centric courses, as well as a large-scale involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in big data and smart communities research. Broad dissemination is ensured via open-source software and periodic workshops and tutorials. K-12 outreach events will be organized to attract under-represented student groups to big data research.<br/><br/>This transformative research will lay the theoretical and practical foundations of smart, connected, and sustainable communities by developing the first big data-driven holistic approach to joint planning, optimization, and deployment of community infrastructure for systems of critical importance, such as communication, energy, and transportation networks. By bringing together interdisciplinary domain experts from data science, electrical engineering, and civil and architectural engineering, this research will yield several innovations: 1) Novel big data techniques for faithfully creating spatio-temporal models for smart communities that integrate data from heterogeneous sources and shed light on the composition and operation of a given smart community, 2) Novel, data-driven performance metrics that advance powerful mathematical tools from stochastic geometry to explicitly quantify the health of smart communities via tractable notions of zero energy, zero outage, and zero congestion, 3) Advanced analytical tools that bring forward novel ideas from optimization theory to devise the most effective strategies for deploying, upgrading, and operating various community infrastructure nodes, given the scale, dynamics, and structure of both the data and the community, and 4) A virtual smart community testbed that can accurately reconstruct, simulate, and evaluate the theoretical framework by leveraging open non-proprietary real-world big data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research builds on the team?s prior NSF funded research on the ?ecological homogenization? of the ?American Residential Macrosystem (ARM)? and specifically investigates factors that contribute to stability and/or changes in the ARM. The aim is to determine how factors that effect change?such as shifts in human demographics, desires for biodiversity and water conservation, regulations that govern water use and quality, and dispersal of organisms?will interact with factors that contribute to stability such as social norms, property values, neighborhood and city covenants and laws, and commercial interests. The project will determine ecological implications of alternative futures of the ARM for the assembly of ecological communities, ecosystem function, and responses to environmental change and disturbance at parcel (ecosystem), landscape (city), regional (Metropolitan Statistical Area) and continental scales. Five types of residential parcels as well as embedded semi-natural interstitial ecosystems will be studied, across six U.S. cities (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles). Education and outreach work will focus on K-12 teachers and students and on collaborative policy efforts with city, county, and state environmental managers.<br/><br/>This project investigates urbanization?s impact on the ecological homogenization of the American Residential Macrosystem (ARM) in terms of plant biodiversity, soil carbon and nitrogen cycle pools and processes, microclimate, hydrography, and land cover. This similarity of ecological characteristics is driven by complex and dynamic human actions at multiple scales?e.g., parcel, neighborhood, and region?that will shape the structure and function of the ARM over 50 to 100 year time frames, with potentially significant continental scale effects on ecological processes and environmental quality. This research addresses two core questions. First, what factors contribute to maintenance and change in the ARM? While this macrosystem is a relatively homogeneous mixture of grass lawns, shrubs, trees and impervious surfaces, there is a critical need to determine how drivers of change such as shifts in human population and ethnicity, increasing desires for biodiversity and water conservation, and regulations governing water use and quality will interact with stabilizing factors such as social norms, property values, neighborhood and city covenants and laws, and commercial interests. Researchers will test the hypothesis that that although dispersal from natural and interstitial areas, climate change, and changes in homeowner knowledge will promote ecological change; institutions, norms and values will function as counteracting, stabilizing forces on these ecological dynamics. This hypothesis will be tested by evaluating the factors that motivate change and stability at multiple scales. Results will be used to produce quantitative, data-based scenarios of future land-use patterns in the ARM. Second, what are the ecological implications of alternative futures of this macrosystem for community assembly and ecosystem function at parcel (ecosystem), landscape (city), regional (Metropolitan Statistical Area), and continental scales?  The hypothesis to be tested is that management that promotes nutrient- and water-use efficient and wildlife-supporting plants as well as lower inputs of water and nutrients will give rise to greater regional biodiversity across trophic levels, higher nutrient retention, lower water use, and reduced runoff and losses of soil carbon and nitrogen from residential yards at the regional scale. Five types of residential parcels that vary in management goals and intensity and embedded semi-natural interstitial ecosystems will be studied in six U.S. cities across the U.S. (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles), to quantify influences on ecological dynamics. This information will be linked to land use scenarios to address the regional and continental-scale impacts of these effects. Three postdocs will be mentored as co-investigators on this project. The research program will also include interaction with municipal decision makers focused on sustainability and add a new ?Panel of Experts? feature to the YardMap citizen science program developed at Cornell University."

It is clear that new educational strategies need to be developed and implemented in order to diversify the engineering profession. This project takes a fresh approach in an effort to demonstrate the role students' individual identities (i.e., intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, ability, sexual identity, language, etc.) play in helping or hindering success in undergraduate engineering and computer science programs. The project's results should reveal tangible, practical themes which point to why some students pursue, persist, and retain in the engineering profession while others do not. Research findings will provide a foundation for future work focused on the identification, design, and implementation of curricular and programmatic transformation in engineering and computer science, towards the end of creating equitable, just educational environments that intentionally recognize the various aspects of students' identities, recognize the importance of social, economic and political power and its differential, stratifying impact on lived experiences, and affirm students across their differences.<br/><br/>It is hypothesized that students who identify along social categories that are centered in US culture (e.g., white, able bodied, heterosexual, male, Christian, socioeconomic affluence) will have a higher sense of belonging and self-efficacy as they progress through their undergraduate engineering programs, relative to those who identify with other groups. Both sense of belonging and self-efficacy have been shown to be positively correlated to retention and to professional identity formation. Because relational and structural power accrues to those who most closely approximate the mythical norm, those who do not align with these social categories may be compelled to assimilate or to withhold or even deny integral parts of their social and cultural identities as a means to successfully navigate engineering culture. This is referred to as ""identity severance"" and it is hypothesized that it is negatively correlated to persistence in engineering education and practice. Achieving the above stated goal will require that we investigate both student and faculty perceptions of intersecting social identities and their confluence with engineering culture. A mixed methods approach will be used, combining both qualitative and quantitative techniques in order to provide a more holistic understanding. By the end of the grant, the following objectives will be met: (i) ascertain themes of identity severance among engineering and computer science students from marginalized communities that have the potential to affect the path towards becoming situated within the engineering profession; and, (ii) identify the role faculty's understanding of relational and structural power across difference plays in helping or hindering students from marginalized groups successfully navigate the path towards becoming situated within the engineering profession. This project will be implemented collaboratively across three very distinct institutions -- Kapiolani Community College (a two-year tribal college), Oregon State University (a Research I institution), and The University of Texas-Pan American (a Hispanic Serving Institution).  The three serve significantly different student populations and regions, but most likely share manifestations of identity severance that influence the success and persistence of engineering and computer science students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given their scale and level of detail, clickstreams present an enormous opportunity for research into user behavioral analysis and modeling. Understanding, modeling and predicting user behavior can dramatically improve the security of today's online systems, while significantly advancing understanding of user behavior. This project develops a general platform for user behavioral modeling using clickstreams, with the goal of providing general tools for modeling user behavior in any application context. If successful, this approach will produce a generalized platform for identifying similar types of user behavior.  Prior work using a similar approach already produced significant results in the context of automatically detecting fake accounts and identities in online social networks.<br/><br/>The PIs will explore the use of clickstream similarity graphs, graphs designed to capture and model the similarity (or differences) between behavior logs of different users. By applying existing graph analysis techniques, these similarity graphs can identify general user behavioral patterns using semi-supervised learning techniques, and can be used to identify abnormal or unknown user behavior patterns. The researchers will use real detailed clickstreams from two online social networks (Renren and Whisper). The goal of the project is to make clickstream similarity graphs a general and practical user modeling tool. The project will address 3 key challenges.  First, it will explore and address challenges of scale in users and trace length, so that the techniques can be applied to large user populations of hundreds of millions. Second, the project will quantify the level of dynamics in user behavior over time, developing techniques to incrementally modify or update user behavior models. Finally, the PIs will study issues in application specificity, i.e., how we can tune the tool for different dimensions of user behavior."

By focusing on several major cities that are responding to affordable housing shortages in different ways, this project will provide new understanding regarding the effectiveness and unanticipated consequences of different government policies.  The research team will generate new data and analyses about processes of global urbanization, the relationship between housing and poverty, and the large-scale environmental impact of expanding cities.

The researchers will document how the development of certain ideas and laws helped to contribute to the current crisis, which will provide lessons for planners and other decision makers.  The project also will catalogue the human costs of the crisis and record how housing policies work on a day-to-day basis, offering policy makers new insights into the complex nature of the problem.<br/><br/>Through their analysis of four cities on four different continents (New York in the U.S., London in the United Kingdom, Lagos in Nigeria, and Delhi in India), the investigators will identify key sources of the global affordable housing crisis by exploring the historical record, present-day strategies of housing provision, and a range of social and environmental transformations taking place in territories far removed from the city.  They will document multiple consequences of the affordable housing crisis, including historical processes of dispossession and land enclosure, present-day survival strategies of low-income families in high-cost cities, and broader trends of accelerated urbanization.  They also will assess why cities have responded to the affordable housing crisis in vastly different ways as well as the consequences of those varied responses for low-income families, cities, and surrounding environments.  The investigators will analyze infrastructure and property relations, urban poverty and housing market dynamics, migration patterns, and flows of capital and other resources.  Historical geoparsing algorithms will analyze a large textual database of archival sources that document the worldwide contestation of property rights in the 20th century.  Ethnographic fieldwork in the four focal cities will document the everyday lives of low-income residents and analyze how different housing policies play out on the ground level.

One way in which languages differ is their use of stress and tone. English is a language which uses stress to distinguish word meanings: compare the word ""record"" when used as a verb (""to recrd"") and as a noun (""the rcord""). Other languages use stress to mark the edges of words. Similar patterns are found with tone: in Tokyo Japanese, for instance, the meaning of the word ""hashi"" depends on the pitch melody with which it is spoken (with a high-low melody it means ""chopsticks"", and with a low-high melody it means ""bridge""). Languages which use just one of these features are very common. Less common, and less studied, are languages which use stress and tone together. Until such languages are studied in greater detail, we will not have a complete picture of the sound systems of human languages and the ways in which they can vary.<br/><br/>This project investigates stress and tone in Uspanteko, a highly endangered Mayan language spoken by approximately 1000-3000 people in the central highlands of Guatemala. Uspanteko uses tone to distinguish word meanings, as in ""sip"" (high tone, means ""tick"") vs. ""siip"" (no high tone, means ""gift""). Alongside tone, stress is used in Uspanteko to mark the edges of words. The primary aim of this project is to document and analyze the acoustic structure of stress and tone in Uspanteko. As the sound system of Uspanteko is typologically unusual, this project has the potential to contribute substantially to our understanding of cross-linguistic variation in the areas of stress and tone.

The instrument will be able to completely analyze complex mixtures of molecules in microbiomes and in rapidly changing chemical environments. The microbes that live on and within vertebrates play a critical role in metabolism, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their influence are not well understood. This instrument will allow simultaneous monitoring of many molecules produced by these microbes. The same instrumentation will also be adapted to detect important, short-lived chemical species.  These highly reactive species play central roles in many chemical reactions - for example, in flames and in the atmosphere - but many have never been directly observed. Developing this instrumentation will also provide an ideal arena for an interdisciplinary collaboration in which undergraduate and graduate students in physics, chemistry, and chemical biology will learn about the challenges and capabilities of each other's areas of science.  Overall, advancing this technology will add a powerful technique to the suite of chemical analysis tools currently available to the microbiology and chemistry communities.<br/><br/><br/>Detecting, identifying, and quantifying the complex mixtures of volatile, reactive molecules found in microbiomes and many other chemical environments is a challenging and important problem. A host of sensitive mixture analysis techniques exist today, but no technique can definitively analyze gas phase mixtures with hundreds of components, and many methods require laborious adjustment for each new species to be analyzed. The analysis of short lived, reactive species is a particularly difficult problem, as most separation techniques operate too slowly to observe such molecules. Fourier Transform Microwave Spectroscopy (FTMW) is exceptionally well suited to this challenging analysis problem. FTMW works by exciting and then detecting narrow, highly specific rotational (microwave) resonances in gas phase molecules. Fingerprints of distinct species can be separated electronically, and physical separation or purification of samples is not required, even for mixtures with hundreds of components. The new instrumentation leverages recent advances in microwave spectroscopy techniques, cryogenics, and fast electronics to dramatically increase the sensitivity of FTMW.  The cryogenic techniques used here further provide one of the most inert chemical environments ever achieved, allowing for the stabilization and detection of highly reactive compounds. These reactive compounds play critical roles in many chemical environments, despite lasting for a small fraction of a second under typical conditions. The instrumentation will be adapted to study both complex mixtures produced in microbiomes and reactive mixtures produced in rapidly changing chemical environments. This instrumentation will allow scientists to unravel chemical environments of previously unmanageable complexity, providing an important new tool for studying a wide range of important chemical and biochemical systems. <br/><br/>This award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), and (2) Chemical Measurement and Imaging, in the Division of Chemistry"

Fuel blending has been widely adopted among coal-fired plants to produce a blend satisfying heat and emission standards, which requires power plants to manage their complex fuel chains to ensure that the right fuel is available at the right time. Such a situation is more complicated when non-traditional biomass is included for co-firing.  To resolve this pressing issue, this research will: (i) collect and analyze real data to identify critical and random factors; (ii) build comprehensive fuel supply chain models using stochastic programming and/or robust optimization methods; (iii) develop efficient algorithms to compute optimal/near-optimal solutions for practical instances; (iv) demonstrate the effectiveness of those models and algorithms on achieving an optimal balance among emission reduction, economic efficiency and reliability in power generation.<br/><br/>If successful, this research will provide a set of substantial tools that will significantly improve the design and operation of coal-fired power plants and their fuel supply chains. The estimated savings nationwide could be multi-billion dollars annually. More broadly, these tools can be utilized in biomass integration, economic analysis of retrofit technologies, and contract negotiations. They are also applicable to other industries, such as chemical and food industries. Our research findings will be disseminated timely via conferences, journal publications and a dedicated internet page containing relevant tools, models, case studies, and tutorials/manuals. Undergraduate and graduate students will also benefit from this award through new course material and research involvement. The transformative impact will be generated through the close collaboration with industrial partners and student interns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
