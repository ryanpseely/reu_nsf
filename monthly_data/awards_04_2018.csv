These technicians troubleshoot and repair components of production lines that keep manufacturing processes running smoothly. Currently, industries in Northeast Florida face a shortage of skilled instrumentation and controls technicians. This problem is exacerbated by the predicted turnover of approximately one third of the manufacturing workforce over the next five years because of retirements. Advanced manufacturing industries regularly redesign and streamline production lines, including increasing the use of automated processes. As a result, there is an ongoing expansion of the skills that instrumentation and control technicians need to do their jobs. To address this need, Florida State College at Jacksonville (Florida) will develop a new Instrumentation and Controls concentration for its existing Associate of Science degree in Engineering Technology. The project team will work closely with industry partners to: modify the curriculum; obtain industry-standard equipment for laboratory exercises; and provide problem-based, hands-on learning experiences for students. The project will examine and contribute to what is known about hands-on instrumentation training, support effective strategies for recruiting underrepresented students to the instrumentation and controls field, and help fill the critical need for these technicians in Northeast Florida.<br/><br/>This project will develop and modify five courses to create a concentration in Instrumentation and Controls for the existing associate degree program. The courses will include hands-on simulation laboratory activities that engage students in the types of processes they will encounter on the job. The activities will give students access to new technologies, and increased practice to master essential industrial instrumentation skills. Authentication assessments and proper procedures for handling sensors and instrumentation will be central components of the curricular modifications. Laboratory tasks will emphasize the development of skills required to manage, operate, calibrate, and troubleshoot equipment. These tasks will also focus on enhancing knowledge associated with experimental, quality, and safety procedures. The project will foster technician skills training using a developmental curriculum that includes embedded and stacked credentials. Students' self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and career awareness related to advanced manufacturing will be measured. The result will be used to document the impact of the courses and lab activities on student learning and preparation for the workforce. Outreach activities will be conducted with area high schools to promote awareness of and career interest in instrumentation and controls technology. The project will emphasize involvement of students from underrepresented and underserved populations, to encourage diversity of the workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, higher education has not yet developed comprehensive curricula, educational resources, and information technology training programs that lead to industry certification in cloud computing.  To meet this need and serve as a model for other community colleges, this project at Miami Dade College InterAmerican Campus aims to develop and implement a new educational pathway in cloud computing. The student body at Miami Date College InterAmerican Campus includes a large, predominantly low-income, minority student population.  As a result, the project has the potential to increase the number of certified cloud computing technicians from underrepresented minority groups to meet local and national workforce needs. <br/><br/>The project objectives include: (1) Development and implementation of a professional development program that will train 15 MDC technology faculty members to teach cloud computing courses utilizing project-based learning methodology; (2) Creation of an academic pathway that will align a college credit certificate in Enterprise Cloud Computing to associate and baccalaureate degrees in information systems technology; (3) Recruitment, retention, and graduation of approximately 25 students each academic year in the newly developed Enterprise Cloud Computing program; (4) Development of a K-16 pipeline by offering a Cloud 101 summer boot camp for 40 high school students from traditionally underrepresented populations.  In addition to curriculum development, the project also aims to advance knowledge about student success and degree attainment in technology fields and to generate a deeper understanding of factors that lead to improved retention of (STEM) students at Hispanic-serving institutions. This information can benefit other institutions that are committed to advancing underrepresented student success in technology disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Working collaboratively with industry partners to address the regional demand for gender-diversity in engineering and engineering technology (E&ET) occupations, this project at Norwalk Community College in Connecticut aims to to attract more females to the college E&ET education programs. Building on research findings, the project will focus on the following student-centered objectives: (1) designing and implementing strategies for recruiting and retaining female students in E&ET programs; (2) retaining female students by implementing high-impact practices within courses and through student support programs; and (3) designing and delivering a contextualized Intermediate algebra course that includes research based methods for increasing success rates of female students. Because the college has recently been designated a Hispanic Serving Institution, the project will strive to increase in the number of Hispanic female students, further supporting the diversification of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce. A comprehensive evaluation will be completed to help determine which strategies work best and for whom. This project may provide a model that other community colleges and employers can use to increase workforce diversity.<br/><br/>The new recruitment and retention strategies will build upon earlier ATE projects that have been conducted at peer institutions and use resources that have been developed to address the gender gap in E&ET programs. Panel discussions with local business and industry partners will aim to raise awareness of the program on campus and encourage faculty to enhance their course curricula. Using online training and campus workshops, faculty will learn about tools and techniques for supporting diverse learners and how to apply these techniques to their courses. The project will design and pilot a contextualized Intermediate Algebra course, because most of the college E&ET students start at that level, and it is a required course for undecided students. Female students enrolled in that course will be encouraged to pursue a degree in E&ET. The course will include female friendly examples, group work in class, and team projects where women can develop a sense of community and ownership over their learning.  This course will be a model for other faculty members who aim to incorporate context- and female-supportive practices in their curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The present method for producing ammonia, the 100-year-old Haber-Bosch process, is based on natural gas and consumes 1-2% of total global energy. It is a high-pressure, high-temperature process that is only economical if used for large-scale production. There would be significant advantages to producing ammonia directly from renewable forms of electricity at the location where it is needed. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that this can be accomplished with high efficiency. <br/><br/>This project will seek to develop an electrochemical method for production of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen using a proton-conducting, ceramic, solid-oxide electrochemical cell. The central hypothesis is that atmospheric-pressure, ammonia synthesis can be realized by electrochemically driving hydrogen onto catalytic surfaces that are normally limited by high nitride coverage. The project will seek to develop electrode catalysts that are able to dissociate molecular nitrogen, the rate-limiting step in conventional Haber-Bosch synthesis, while simultaneously showing low activity for hydrogen recombination so as to achieve a high hydrogen fugacity at the electrode surface. The project will take advantage of the infiltration methods previously developed for electrode synthesis in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells which allows a wide range of materials to be used for the electrodes. The project will explore mixed electronic-protonic conductors that can be added to the electrode to enhance the three-phase boundary where the electrochemical reaction can occur. The choice of electrocatalysts will be guided by complementary theoretical studies. Small-scale demonstration cells will be produced. If successful, the project will have a dramatic impact on the energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions from ammonia synthesis. The project will support both graduate and undergraduate students in conducting the research, and the PIs will develop faculty-led peer mentorship programs that aim to increase retention of underrepresented undergraduate students in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at their home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Fayetteville State University (FSU), will conduct research aimed at addressing one of the most pressing environmental concerns of our age: the escalating level of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a major greenhouse gas largely correlated to the combustion of fossil fuels. For the foreseeable future, it seems that the ever-growing energy demand will most likely necessitate more consumption of these indispensable sources of energy. Therefore, it is strategically important to develop technologies for Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS). Currently, aqueous amine solution is the most advanced technology for carbon capture. However, the use of aqueous amine solution suffers from several significant drawbacks, including apparatus corrosion and high regeneration cost. These disadvantages can be alleviated if we graft amine into porous solid matrix instead of mixing with water. This project aims at developing novel amine-grafted porous organic polymers for efficient carbon capture. We expect two major benefits for our designed materials: one is noncorrosive. Amines are grafted inside the porous solid matrix without direct contact the apparatus. The other is energy efficient. Water has one of the highest heat capacities. It costs a lot more energy to heat aqueous solution than porous solid in a temperature swing process. The successful implementation of this proposed research will enhance our international competitiveness in carbon capture technology.<br/><br/>The scientific challenges for amine-grafted porous materials to become an economically viable technology for carbon capture are their CO2 loading, recyclability, and manufacturing costs. The better understanding of adsorption-desorption mechanisms of CO2 in amine-grafted porous materials is one of the key factors which will help us design and synthesize such materials to reach maximum CO2 loading with optimized energy efficiency. We propose several strategies to build porous polymeric platforms to study the structure-property correlations between amines and CO2 molecules. First, we build anchors in the porous platforms, then we use these anchors to attach amines of different lengths. The number of amines that could be incorporated is largely dependent upon the number of installed anchors; therefore, high concentration and even distribution of anchors inside the porous platforms ensure the maximum amine loading afterwards. The proposed research will advance our understanding of the CO2 adsorption-desorption mechanisms in amine-grafted porous materials at the molecular level. The knowledge generated will guide the development of such materials of high CO2 loading with optimized energy efficiency. The proposed research will also allow the PI to work with two to three undergraduate researchers each year over a three-year course. All of them will obtain extensive training in experimental design and implementation, data collection and analysis, results presentation and publication, etc. Such experiences will boost their competency and prepare them for graduate schools or professional workforces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Active hydrothermal vent sulfide chimneys are hotspots of biodiversity and productivity in the deep ocean, as well as potential resources for metals. While significant effort has focused on understanding the diversity of biological communities and geochemistry associated with actively venting SMS, relatively little is known about the biological communities associated with SMS once venting ceases. Furthermore, little is known about the microbiological and geochemical changes that occur during the transition period from active to inactive, during which an important succession occurs in the microbial community and geochemistry of fluids within the chimney. This interdisciplinary project will create and sample this transition period by collecting multiple active SMS samples from individual vents at 9 degrees N East Pacific Rise and allowing them to transition to inactive on the seafloor, mimicking the end of venting while allowing for the exact time when venting ceased to be known, something not possible when sampling naturally formed inactive SMS. Microbial community diversity and metabolism will be analyzed in parallel with bulk and fine-scale geological measurements for active, transitioning, and inactive sulfides. This seafloor experimental and analytical approach will provide knowledge of how microbial communities, rates of biogeochemical transformations, and geological conditions change as SMS transition from hot and actively venting to cold and inactive. Students in grades 6-8 will be entrained into the project through research cruise ""ship-to-shore"" interactions and communications, post-cruise workshops for educators working with students typically underrepresented in STEM fields, and a collaboration with the Science, Engineering, Art and Design Gallery (SEAD), a community and economic development project in Bryan, TX. <br/><br/>Hydrothermal vents are quantitatively important to the biology and chemistry of the deep ocean, but the vast majority of current knowledge focuses on actively venting deposits. However, after venting ceases, sulfides can persist on the seafloor for tens of thousands of years, making them long-lived, globally-abundant microbial substrates. In recent years, studies of inactive SMS found drastically different microbial communities than those on active deposits, indicating a succession of the microbial community, and thus a potentially different impact on deep ocean biodiversity and biogeochemistry than actively venting deposits. However, ages of the inactive structures are often not known, so it is impossible to estimate how quickly these changes occur, and how quickly co-occurring changes in sulfide mineralogy and microbiological communities occur. This project will provide the first insight into what happens at the microbial and mineralogical level as SMS initially transition from active to inactive. Active SMS will be sampled and analyzed for microbial community composition, functional capacity, gene expression and metabolic rates. Co-located subsamples will be analyzed for porosity and bulk and fine-scale mineralogy. Subsamples of those active SMS samples will be left on the seafloor to incubate and be collected weeks and a year or more later, with the same analyses conducted upon collection. This will allow for determination of microbiological and mineralogical changes that occur during that initial transition and for comparison with older inactive SMS from the same vent fields. Together, the data collected will be integrated to generate a conceptual model of succession of biology, mineralogy, porosity and pore distribution as vent deposits transition from active to inactive. This project will fill a knowledge gap about hydrothermal ecosystems and has the potential to transform the current understanding of diversity and rates of change in these important seafloor biomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacteria colonize and coat the inside pipe surfaces in DWDSs to form biofilms that are responsible for a multitude of problems, including corrosion, taste and odor issues, formation of carcinogenic disinfection-by-products (DBPs), loss of the chlorine residual that protects the water from pathogenic microorganisms. All of these problems have serious financial and public health ramifications for the United States. This project aims to develop a fundamental mechanistic understanding of how biofilms attach to pipes, how strong they are, and how easily they can become detached from the pipe surfaces. This research will be used to develop strategies for removal of biofilms from the DWDSs to address the national goal of ensuring safe drinking water to the citizenry. The broader impacts of this research for society include the development of new technological solutions for water utilities and water plant operators. The project also aims to engage Alaska Native undergraduate students in engineering research, with the long-term goal of increasing the number and broadening the participation of Alaska Native students and graduates in engineering.<br/><br/>The research goal of this CAREER project is to enhance the understanding of biofilm mechanical properties, with specific application to biofilms in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs). To meet this overall goal, the proposal has three objectives: (1) investigate the correlation between the biofilm exopolymeric substance (EPS) matrix components and biofilm strength in the DWDS; (2) test novel biofilm weakening strategies and examine the impact of these weakening strategies on the contribution of biofilms to DBP formation in the DWDS; and (3) evaluate the impact of distribution system hydraulics and disinfection on biofilm detachment, biofilm cluster formation and reattachment in the DWDS. A primary educational objective of this project is to involve Alaska Native undergraduate students in engineering research.  Biofilms will be grown in special bench-scale biofilm growth reactors that provide controlled and well-defined environmental conditions simulating distribution systems. Advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, confocal scanning laser microscopy and atomic force microscopy) and biofilm-specific micro-cantilever methods will be employed for determination of EPS compositional analysis and mechanical properties. The PI will also investigate a novel strategy for biofilm weakening by targeting the biofilm EPS, instead of the traditional approach of inactivating biofilm bacteria by using biocides. For that purpose, a suite of strength modifiers and detachment promoting agents for biofilms in DWDSs will be evaluated. The mechanistic study of biofilm cohesive strength will identify the role of various EPS macromolecules in providing strength and structure to biofilms, which will be helpful in designing effective strategies for biofilm control. The insights into the mechanistic basis of biofilm strength and detachment will increase our ability to control and manipulate biofilms in various environmental systems (e.g., biofilters, wastewater treatment, DWDSs) and beyond (e.g., medical biofilms). Understanding biofilm dynamics and detachment in DWDSs will help design better strategies to provide improved drinking water quality, significantly benefitting public health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to continue this line of investigation. More specifically, we aim to study 3-manifolds, harmonic maps, and Riemann surfaces. The study of 3-manifolds is in essence the study of the possible shapes of the universe and as such sits naturally at the intersection of mathematics and theoretical physics.  Surfaces are two-dimensional spaces like the surface of a ball or a doughnut. Their topological and geometric properties have been extensively studied and this research lies at the intersection of all fields of mathematics. The parameter space of all geometric structures on a given surface is called the moduli space. We study moduli spaces because to understand one particular structure on a space we must understand the structure of the space of all structures.  Theory of harmonic maps originates in the theory of minimal surfaces.

For example, paints, inks, and lubricants contain particles of this size that are designed to be well-dispersed in a liquid.  However, particles may deposit or aggregate in ways that diminish performance. It is difficult to predict these unfavorable processes for particles that are non-spherical or have non-uniform surface chemistry. The principal investigator will develop and apply an experimental technique to reveal the physical and chemical forces controlling the deposition or aggregation of these complex particles. The results should transform our understanding of advanced coatings, multiphase materials, and biofilm adhesion. In addition, the PI will form teams of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to explore the world of consumer products, textiles, cosmetics, and food through an experiential summer program. The program consists of laboratory and in-class experiences that will culminate in the development of a college-level course, teaching tools, and case studies to be disseminated throughout Ohio.  <br/><br/>This CAREER award integrates research and educational objectives to transform our understanding of how anisotropic colloidal particles interact with interfaces for the processing of coatings, production of multiphase materials, and understanding of synthetic and biological active colloids.  The research objective of this work is to measure conservative and non-conservative surface interactions for dense suspensions of colloids with anisotropy in both shape and surface chemistry. The current bottleneck to completing this work is that existing surface interaction measurement techniques are either not suitable for such systems or are not sufficiently sensitive. The PI will develop a tool called Scattering Morphology Resolved Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (SMR-TIRM). SMR-TIRM works by utilizing fluctuations in the morphology of evanescent wave scattering from a colloidal particle, rather than the integrated intensity fluctuations. The PI will use SMR-TIRM to quantify the nature of symmetry breaking in driven colloids and the dependence of surface interactions on crowding of anisotropic particles near rigid and non-rigid interfaces. This research will provide crucial information for how anisotropic colloidal particles interact with surfaces. The education objective is to build an experiential program that integrates university activities with those at an on-campus STEM high school, which is part of the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. The theme of the program will be applications of Colloid and Interface Science in the design of chemical products. The program will consist of a college-level course in Chemical Product Design, a project based experiential learning program for high school students, and a research experience fostering multi-level project teams of high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students housed in the new shared Soft Materials Lab at Cleveland State University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These data will address the age-old question, ""How do volcanoes really work?"".  Axial Volcano is an ideal location to obtain information on the underground magma chamber because a lot of other data have already been collected there.  The surface features of Axial Volcano have been mapped in detail and the volcano is monitored in real-time through the Ocean Observatory Initiative Seafloor (OOI) Observatory.  Obtaining an image of the magma chamber structure will complement existing data and the real-time data being provided by OOI, and allow a much better understanding of how Axial Volcano works and when it might erupt. This study will advance understanding of volcanoes both on land and underwater world wide. The project provides training for graduate students and early career scientists. Access to the data will be open. <br/><br/>This project will complete a comprehensive 3-D multichannel seismic survey of Axial Volcano and associated rift axes aboard the R/V Marcus Langseth.  In addition, eight 15-km-long source-receiver offset 2-D reflection profiles will be collected to look at deep-seated structure of magma delivery. A sophisticated set of seismic imaging tools focused on multichannel seismic data collected in underwater volcanic terrains has been developed. This algorithm approach has been used in a number of marine environments in 2-D, with the greatest success thus far at Axial Volcano, where the roof and floor of the underlying magma chamber have been clearly imaged, along with fractures/conduits in the upper crust connecting the magma chamber to nearby hydrothermal vent fields. Despite this success, Axial Volcano is inherently 3-D in nature, thus requiring a 3-D approach to map the complex connections between the magma plumbing system at depth with eruption dynamics at the seafloor. For example, this approach is needed to understand (1) how 3-D fracture sets are associated with magma inflation/withdrawal, rifting, and gravitational spreading/collapse in the upper crust; (2) the geometry and interconnection of complex magma bodies of varying amounts of melt/mush; (3) the relationship between internal structure and seafloor observables such as hydrothermal fields and lava flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers will explore the design and development of a 3D puzzle-based game, called May's Journey, in which players solve an environmental maze by using the game's pseudo code to manipulate game objects. The game is designed to teach introductory but foundational concepts of computer programming including abstraction, modularity, reusability, and debugging by focusing players on logic and concepts while asking them to type simple instructions in a simplified programming language designed for novices. The game design in this project differs from today's block-based programming learning approaches that are often too far from actual computer code, and also differs from professional programming languages which are too complex for novices. The game and its embedded programming language learning are designed to be responsive to the progress of the learner throughout the game, transitioning from pseudo code to the embedded programming language itself. Error messages for debugging are also designed to be adaptive to players' behavior in the game. Using extensive log data collected from people playing the game, researchers can study how people learn computer programming. Such knowledge can advance understanding of the learning processes in computer programming education. Additionally, this work emphasizes the use of games as informal learning environments as they are accessible and fun, drawing attention and retention of many learners of different age groups with the potential to change attitudes towards computer programming across different populations. This project is co-funded by the STEM + Computing (STEM+C) program that supports research and development to understand the integration of computing and computational thinking in STEM learning, and the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that funds innovative research, approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings with its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>The project's formative and summative evaluation methods, including surveys, expert reviews of learners' computer code developed in the game, and interviews, are used to gauge learners' engagement as well as learning. In exploring learning, researchers aim to understand how players build implicit computer science knowledge through gameplay and how that gameplay relates to their performance on external transfer tasks. The project will answer the following three research questions: (1) Can observers reliably detect and label patterns of gameplay that provide evidence of learning or misconceptions regarding the four computer science constructs - abstraction, modularity, debugging and semantics - that learners exhibit playing May's Journey? (2) How does learner's implicit knowledge of these computer science constructs change over time and do those patterns vary by gender and prior programming experiences? (3) Is there a strong correlation between implicit learning measures and transfer of CS concepts: modularity, debugging, semantics, and abstraction? How do these correlations vary across elements of the game? This work will result in several outcomes: game design metaphors tested for their learning and engagement value that can be abstracted and embedded in different games. This project will also contribute patterns and an understanding of how people learn and engage in problem solving using concepts of abstraction, modularity, debugging and semantics. These outcomes will lead to advancement in knowledge in the learning sciences as well as the design of educational games that enrich STEM learning, particularly in programming and computational thinking. In addition, this project will engage female participants and underserved populations through partnering organizations including National Girls Collaborative project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the surface of the ball curves of least length (geodesics) emanating from a point in different directions tend to not move away from each other in the short term, or at least less rapidly than in the flat surface, whereas in the saddle surface the geodesics curve away from each other rapidly. This behavior is related to the curvature of the surface, with the sphere of positive curvature, the flat surface of zero curvature, and the saddle of negative curvature. Analogs of this behavior hold in higher dimensional objects that occur in nature. Curvature plays a key role in how natural phenomena such as dissipation of heat and electricity behave, and this is true also in objects that are not as smooth as the three types described above. Such non-smooth objects occur in nature and have creases, bumps and fractal-like structure, and so the classical theory of curvature does not apply to them. The focus of this project is to use the analog of curvature developed for the non-smooth setting recently, and explore how that dictates the behavior of natural phenomena such as heat dissipation in such objects.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to explore links between the notions of negative curvature of a metric space on the one hand, and nonlinear potential theory and quasiconformal mappings on the other hand. The spaces considered are equipped with a uniformly locally doubling measure supporting a uniformly local Poincare inequality. A prototype space equipped with a uniformly locally doubling measure supporting a uniformly local Poincare inequality but does not support their global analogs is the smooth hyperbolic manifold, and experience tells us that such spaces have exponential volume growth at large scales. This project is divided into three parts. In the first part of the project, the focus is the large scale negative curvature of the space (as given in optimal mass transportation) and its connections to large-scale potential theory (non-linear ``heat"" energy dissipation) and hyperbolicity of ends. In the second part the aim is to construct geometric families of curves connecting pairs of points in the space when the space has lower bounded Ricci curvature in the sense of Lott and Villani. The third part of the project is to consider bounded doubling nonsmooth spaces as boundaries of Gromov-hyperbolic filling and use this perspective to study non-local potential theory and regularity of nonlocal energy minimizers on poorly pathconnected spaces. The research described herein forms a part of the program of quasiconformal classification of nonsmooth spaces. Such spaces arise in the study of smooth manifolds when considering Gromov-Hausdorff limit spaces as in the works of Cheeger, Gromov, and Perelman.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The clusters being studied are aggregates of 3-40 atoms.  The chemical and physical properties of these clusters depend on their size.   The Wang research group is able to continuously vary the number of atoms in a cluster, which means that they can explore in detail how the atoms are bonded to each other.  The chemical bonds in boron clusters are very strong, which might mean that these clusters may make possible new materials with new and useful properties. Prof. Wang and his research team are interested in creating and characterizing novel boron cluster structures including clusters containing a few metal atoms such as bismuth (Bi) cobalt (Co), rhodium (Rh), and iridium (Ir).  In addition to the lasers used in the experimental work, the Wang research team also do theoretical calculations that help interpret experimental data and predict new, never before seen structures (for example, what to clusters containing more than 50 atoms look like?). The long-term goal of the project is to discover new boron-based molecules and new forms of boron materials.<br/><br/>The project focuses on three sub-topics: 1) structural evolution of large size-selected boron clusters, 2) neutral boron clusters and borospherenes (cage-like boron clusters), and 3) metal-doped boron clusters. These clusters are produced by a laser-vaporization supersonic cluster source and studied by a variety of experimental and theoretical techniques. Photoelectron spectroscopy is used to probe the structures and bonding of large negatively-charged boron clusters with more than 40 atoms. High-resolution photoelectron imaging of negatively-charged boron clusters is employed to provide vibrational and structural information for the associated neutral clusters. An infrared and ultraviolet double-resonant approach is used to directly probe neutral boron clusters, as a complementary technique to the high-resolution photoelectron imaging experiment. The structures and bonding of metal-doped boron clusters are studied by both photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution photoelectron imaging. These experiments provide vibrational and electronic structure fingerprints, which are combined with computational chemistry to elucidate the structure, stability, and chemical bonding of boron and metal-doped boron clusters. The broader impact of this work is to build the foundation and knowledge base to discover new boron-based nanomaterials, which can have potential technological applications and societal benefits. This project is integrated to the teaching of physical chemistry by the PI, as well as providing research-training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In both glasses and liquids, the atoms are arranged without order - jumbled up, like marbles in jar, not sitting in rows like eggs in an egg carton. That disorder poses special problems for experiments measuring how the atoms are arranged and how they move with respect to one another. This project addresses those problems by studying how nanometer-diameter probe beams of electrons interact with the atoms as the beam is moved from place to place, which reveals how they are arranged, or with a fixed beam position as a function of time, which reveals how the atoms move.<br/><br/>Understanding how the atoms are arranged and how they move will enable researchers to understand fundamental questions in the materials physics of glasses, including: (1) How does a liquid cool into a solid glass? Do some parts of the liquid stop moving first, or do all the atoms slow down at once? If some parts stop first, what is different about the atomic arrangements in those regions? (2) How do the atoms in a glass rearrange when they are given just a little heat energy ? not enough to melt, but enough to move around a bit? This process is called aging, and it can make a flexible metallic glass brittle, but it is currently poorly understood at the atomic scale.<br/><br/>Answers to these questions will lay the scientific groundwork for scientists to design new metallic glass alloys with desirable properties like very high hardness, high formability into parts, and high corrosion resistance. These new materials may find applications in areas ranging from medical devices and implants to nanomachines with tiny gears or other sliding parts. This project will train scientists and engineers to create new metallic glass materials and understand how they work at the atomic scale, and it will promote science and engineering to K-12 students through live demonstrations of imaging single atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter, using the power of electron microscopy.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This project will support investigation of the heterogeneous structure and dynamics of metallic glass and glass-forming liquids at the nanoscale using coherent electron nanodiffraction in the form of electron correlation microscopy (ECM) and fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM). Spatially heterogeneous dynamics in supercooled liquids are central to many theories of the glass transition, and temporally heterogeneous dynamics in the glass are central to structural relaxation.<br/><br/>ECM experiments on liquids will yield a dynamic length scale and characteristic time for liquid-state dynamics over at least two decades in time, and investigate the glass transition behavior of a recently-discovered near-surface layer with dynamics at least one order of magnitude faster than the bulk. ECM experiments on glasses will reveal the size and spatial distribution of the individual events that create structural relaxation, and FEM experiments will yield insight into the structure of glasses before and after relaxation. New, combined ECM/FEM experiments will enable direct, experimental correlations between nanoscale structure and dynamics. In liquids, the hypothesis that regions with icosahedral local structure have slower dynamics will be tested, and in glasses, tools and approaches will be developed with the goal of measuring the changes in structure associated with single relaxation events. Together, these results will test existing theories of the glass transition and relaxation and drive development of new theories. The insights gained on metal systems with simple bonding have the potential for impact across materials classes, including oxide, chalcogenide, small molecule, and even polymer glasses.<br/><br/>The physical insights generated by this project will lay the groundwork for rational design of metallic glass alloys with high glass forming ability and desirable properties including high hardness, high elastic limit, and either high corrosion resistance or biologically benign corrosion products for applications ranging from biomedical devices and implants to micro- or nanomechanical machines. This project will support teaching and learning through ongoing updating of the Electron Microscopy Database website, and it will share the excitement of science through live demonstrations to K-12 students of imaging single atoms using high-resolution electron microscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such ubiquitous network connections raise a number of important concerns. For example, our devices regularly send data over networks they do not fully trust and that are not under our control, which can lead to security vulnerabilities, poor service, and privacy violations.  To address these issues, this proposal seeks to develop Personal Virtual Networks, or PVNs, that provide each device with its own network within a network provider that can provide customizable security and privacy.  <br/><br/>This proposal introduces the idea of ubiquitous PVNs that can be configured to provide privacy, security and performance across untrusted heterogeneous networks.  PVNs will allow devices to establish trusted network configurations inside of network providers, define policies for network traffic, and even deploy limited code that interposes on their traffic using a software middlebox environment. By making in-network resources available to devices via a secure and flexible interface, PVNs can enable more secure, flexible, private, and performant network experiences for users. The proposed work will design a new architecture, as well as abstractions and primitives for providing safe, flexible, and portable user-defined network policies. To support deployments in untrusted environments, this project will include the development of new algorithms and network measurements for auditing PVN deployments in untrusted networks, as well as the design of new frameworks that provide provable privacy and security guarantees atop trusted hardware. Last, the proposed work will develop and conduct empirical evaluations of new applications and services that are enabled by PVNs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These data will address the age-old question, ""How do volcanoes really work?"".  Axial Volcano is an ideal location to obtain information on the underground magma chamber because a lot of other data have already been collected there.  The surface features of Axial Volcano have been mapped in detail and the volcano is monitored in real-time through the Ocean Observatory Initiative Seafloor (OOI) Observatory.  Obtaining an image of the magma chamber structure will complement existing data and the real-time data being provided by OOI, and allow a much better understanding of how Axial Volcano works and when it might erupt. This study will advance understanding of volcanoes both on land and underwater world wide. The project provides training for graduate students and early career scientists. Access to the data will be open. <br/><br/>This project will complete a comprehensive 3-D multichannel seismic survey of Axial Volcano and associated rift axes aboard the R/V Marcus Langseth.  In addition, eight 15-km-long source-receiver offset 2-D reflection profiles will be collected to look at deep-seated structure of magma delivery. A sophisticated set of seismic imaging tools focused on multichannel seismic data collected in underwater volcanic terrains has been developed. This algorithm approach has been used in a number of marine environments in 2-D, with the greatest success thus far at Axial Volcano, where the roof and floor of the underlying magma chamber have been clearly imaged, along with fractures/conduits in the upper crust connecting the magma chamber to nearby hydrothermal vent fields. Despite this success, Axial Volcano is inherently 3-D in nature, thus requiring a 3-D approach to map the complex connections between the magma plumbing system at depth with eruption dynamics at the seafloor. For example, this approach is needed to understand (1) how 3-D fracture sets are associated with magma inflation/withdrawal, rifting, and gravitational spreading/collapse in the upper crust; (2) the geometry and interconnection of complex magma bodies of varying amounts of melt/mush; (3) the relationship between internal structure and seafloor observables such as hydrothermal fields and lava flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor David Jonas of the University of Colorado at Boulder is developing femtosecond laser techniques to study the motion of electrons in molecules. A femtosecond is a millionth of a billionth of a second. Inside molecules, atoms and slow electrons move on the femtosecond timescale. The goal of the project is to measure how atomic and electronic motions are linked when the forces driving their motion are weak. Such weak forces can arise from energies on the order of the thermal energy. This project explores the smallest energy required to drive motion of electrons. Similar electronic motions are involved in lighting, displays, and photosynthesis. Three dimensional spectra correlate electronic and atomic motion. High symmetry molecules simplify the study of electronic and atomic motions.<br/><br/>In 3D Fourier transform spectroscopy, four-wave mixing is used to record transient signals as a function of three time delays between pulses. Triple Fourier transformation with respect to the three time delays generates a spectrum that is a function of three frequency axes. Unlike most 2D spectra, the pulse spectra and pulse propagation effects can be divided out in 3D. This reveals the underlying 3D nonlinear response, which should be independent of experimental conditions. The signal from cross-phase modulation in transparent solvents produces compact time-domain transients for initial experimental recovery of the underlying 3D response. 2D and 3D electronic spectroscopy of high symmetry molecules with pseudo Jahn-Teller effects can reveal the mechanism of their femtosecond electronic population transfer through comparison to quantum mechanical calculations. The calculations fully incorporate non-adiabatic interactions between motion of electrons and the vibrational motion of atoms. The broader impacts of this project include training of students in modern experimental and computational techniques plus potential societal benefits from a better understanding of the minimum energy required to drive electronic motion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These organisms discovered a way to make their own food using the virtually limitless supply of water and sunlight available near the surface of the oceans.  As far as science knows, organisms have found only one way to perform this water oxidation process, and it is possible that modern plants and photosynthetic organisms are still using that same evolutionary innovation from billions of years ago, although presumably significantly evolved. The enzyme that performs this reaction is called Photosystem II, and despite the central importance of this reaction to the fields of biology and energy, many questions remain about how this enzyme works. Professor Zdilla is working to build molecular models of the enzyme active site, which is a cube-shaped cluster of metal atoms containing manganese and calcium. The working models developed by Professor Zdilla may lead to insights on how photosynthetic organisms are able to perform this important reaction. Professor Zdilla continues his community engagement of youth and adult communities through talks during the Philadelphia Science Festival and at Philadelphia elementary schools. Professor Zdilla also develops the Database of Educational Crystallographic Online Resources (DECOR), a free, downloadable source of educational materials for the study of crystallography. <br/><br/>The primary source of cellular energy on earth is the sun, whose visible light energy is harvested by photosynthetic organisms to drive the oxidation of water to O2 and drive the concomitant reduction of carbon dioxide(CO2) to organic molecules, which are then used as fuel and as raw materials for the construction of living things. Photocatalytic water oxidation coupled to proton reduction is also an important goal for the generation of sustainable solar fuels. The enzyme responsible for the biological water oxidation reaction is photosystem II (PSII), a multi-subunit enzyme containing a tetramanganese-calcium-oxo cluster as the catalytic active site. Since enzymes are often a challenge to study directly due to their complexity, bioinorganic chemists frequently turn to biomimetic model complexes. Despite hundreds of examples of synthetic manganese oxo-cluster, very few show compelling reactivity that models PSII. Professor Zdilla and his group develop new approaches to designing biomimetic manganese clusters by prioritizing low-coordination number(to provide water binding sites) and cluster flexibility (to promote molecular rearrangement). These approaches have resulted in clusters that perform a diverse set of difficult reactions including N-N, C-H, C-N, and O=O bond making/breaking reactions, and catalytic water oxidation. This project seeks to further mechanistically investigate their molecular mechanisms, which may inform understanding of the function of the enzyme, and provide clues on how to design superior water oxidation catalysts for energy purposes.

During childbirth, this group of nerves can be injured by mechanical forces, like stretching and pulling. Such a stretch injury to the brachial plexus is called neonatal brachial plexus palsy and can result in varying degrees of paralysis. Though neonatal brachial plexus palsy can be quite detrimental to mobility, there is little data describing how stretching neonatal tissue contributes to injury or how to prevent it, particularly while under the oxygen-starved conditions associated with difficult births. This study will define injury thresholds, i.e., the point at which the tissue structure is irreparably changed by stretching, using animal models. The tissue property data will be used to develop a computational model capable of predicting human-like injury thresholds, which can be used to advance the science of obstetrical care through training and education. The study will test hypotheses relating anatomical location, structural composition, and magnitude of forces exerted on the tissue to the effects on tissue failure and rate of recovery. Research and education are integrated through undergraduate and graduate laboratory-based research, development of a new graduate-level course on integration of biomedical engineering with clinical need, and promoting biomedical engineering in underserved schools of the Philadelphia region with hands-on activities. <br/><br/>Dr. Singh's long-term career goal is to minimize the occurrence of neonatal brachial plexus palsy by providing a detailed understanding of the injury mechanism and to develop prevention and treatment strategies based on fundamental knowledge. Toward this goal, Dr. Singh's research objectives are to: (1) provide a detailed understanding of the biomechanical, physiological, and histological properties of both the normal and hypoxic neonatal brachial plexus in neonatal piglets; and (2) utilize the animal model data to train a computational model to investigate the effects of the birth process on the brachial plexus. Specific hypotheses that will be tested include: (1) neonatal brachial plexus tissue will fail at the root/trunk segment; (2) tissue strain rate corresponds to rate of injury recovery; and (3) the extent of stretch directly affects histological outcome. In vivo biomechanical testing will be conducted using large animal surrogates. Experiments will evaluate the effects of stretch and strain using high-speed cameras, neurophysiological recordings, and histological assessments. The computational model development, starting from an existing framework, will focus on incorporating the parameters for neonatal brachial plexus mechanical properties. The insights gained from these studies will bridge a current knowledge gap, connecting the functional response of the neonatal brachial plexus with injury threshold for permanent damage. The research will culminate with a promising clinical translational tool aimed at reducing the prevalence of human injury at birth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, Indian Hills Community College will seek to increase the number of photonics technicians by encouraging secondary school students to enter a pathway that leads to photonics technician careers. The project will emphasize rural high school students who rarely have learning opportunities in state-of-the-art technologies. The project will enable rural high school students to earn college credit that transfers directly to a two-year photonics degree. This dual credit opportunity will position the students to enroll in, complete a degree program, and obtain a job in the high-demand photonics field. The project will also test the potential of hybrid online instruction to bring advanced technical education into the classrooms of rural school districts, which often have limited budgets. Rural high school teachers will also receive photonics-related professional development.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to increase the number of rural Iowa high school students in photonics technician career pathways. Methods used will include: 1) developing and offering dual credit, hybrid online photonics courses that articulate directly to a two-year photonics degree; 2) providing professional development symposiums and follow-up assistance to Iowa high school teachers to help them incorporate more photonics concepts in their classes; and 3) hosting a photonics summer institute to provide rural Iowa high school students and teachers with more in-depth knowledge of the field. The hybrid online format for the photonics courses will combine traditional online learning with online collaborative learning for labs and other activities. The project will build on work completed by the Midwest Photonics Education Center, an ATE Regional Center at Indian Hills Community College that focused on educating photonics technicians in the Midwest. Portable photonics kits developed by the Midwest Photonics Education Center will be used for lab activities in the hybrid online courses that will be developed in this project. These kits help student learn photonics concepts through hands-on activities, without the need to equip an entire lab. Industry partnerships will also be leveraged to enhance the project activities. The project materials, results, and best practices will be widely disseminated to facilitate the adoption or adaptation of the approach by other community colleges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Active hydrothermal vent sulfide chimneys are hotspots of biodiversity and productivity in the deep ocean, as well as potential resources for metals. While significant effort has focused on understanding the diversity of biological communities and geochemistry associated with actively venting SMS, relatively little is known about the biological communities associated with SMS once venting ceases. Furthermore, little is known about the microbiological and geochemical changes that occur during the transition period from active to inactive, during which an important succession occurs in the microbial community and geochemistry of fluids within the chimney. This interdisciplinary project will create and sample this transition period by collecting multiple active SMS samples from individual vents at 9 degrees N East Pacific Rise and allowing them to transition to inactive on the seafloor, mimicking the end of venting while allowing for the exact time when venting ceased to be known, something not possible when sampling naturally formed inactive SMS. Microbial community diversity and metabolism will be analyzed in parallel with bulk and fine-scale geological measurements for active, transitioning, and inactive sulfides. This seafloor experimental and analytical approach will provide knowledge of how microbial communities, rates of biogeochemical transformations, and geological conditions change as SMS transition from hot and actively venting to cold and inactive. Students in grades 6-8 will be entrained into the project through research cruise ""ship-to-shore"" interactions and communications, post-cruise workshops for educators working with students typically underrepresented in STEM fields, and a collaboration with the Science, Engineering, Art and Design Gallery (SEAD), a community and economic development project in Bryan, TX. <br/><br/>Hydrothermal vents are quantitatively important to the biology and chemistry of the deep ocean, but the vast majority of current knowledge focuses on actively venting deposits. However, after venting ceases, sulfides can persist on the seafloor for tens of thousands of years, making them long-lived, globally-abundant microbial substrates. In recent years, studies of inactive SMS found drastically different microbial communities than those on active deposits, indicating a succession of the microbial community, and thus a potentially different impact on deep ocean biodiversity and biogeochemistry than actively venting deposits. However, ages of the inactive structures are often not known, so it is impossible to estimate how quickly these changes occur, and how quickly co-occurring changes in sulfide mineralogy and microbiological communities occur. This project will provide the first insight into what happens at the microbial and mineralogical level as SMS initially transition from active to inactive. Active SMS will be sampled and analyzed for microbial community composition, functional capacity, gene expression and metabolic rates. Co-located subsamples will be analyzed for porosity and bulk and fine-scale mineralogy. Subsamples of those active SMS samples will be left on the seafloor to incubate and be collected weeks and a year or more later, with the same analyses conducted upon collection. This will allow for determination of microbiological and mineralogical changes that occur during that initial transition and for comparison with older inactive SMS from the same vent fields. Together, the data collected will be integrated to generate a conceptual model of succession of biology, mineralogy, porosity and pore distribution as vent deposits transition from active to inactive. This project will fill a knowledge gap about hydrothermal ecosystems and has the potential to transform the current understanding of diversity and rates of change in these important seafloor biomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their long history, many of these questions remained inaccessible until a series of breakthroughs in the late twentieth century that culminated in the development of Gromov-Witten theory.  The key new ideas were that problems of enumerative geometry are best interpreted in terms of intersection theory on a moduli space, and that insights from the physics of string theory reveal elegant patterns in families of enumerations that were previously unobserved by the mathematics community.  The PI's research program involves developing the intersection theory of a particularly fundamental moduli space - the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of curves - as well as producing rigorous mathematical frameworks for some of the correspondences between theories that physicists have predicted.<br/><br/>A major part of this research program is devoted to studying the Chow ring of the moduli space of curves.  Although a full picture of the Chow ring of this space currently seems out of reach, there is a subring known as the ""tautological ring"" that contains nearly every geometrically-interesting class yet that admits an explicit, finite set of additive generators.  The PI has been an active contributor to the study of the relations among these generators, in joint work with Felix Janda (University of Michigan), Sam Grushevsky (Stony Brook University), and Dmitry Zakharov (Central Michigan University).  In forthcoming work, she plans to develop tautological intersection theory both computationally (producing algorithms for calculating certain desirable expressions for tautological classes in terms of the generators) and theoretically (seeking new tautological expressions for classes such as the hyperelliptic locus).  Much of this work will be carried out in collaboration with student researchers. A second central component of the PI's research is the mathematical proof and extension of equivalences proposed by physics.  For example, in joint work with Felix Janda and Yongbin Ruan (University of Michigan), she has proven a wall-crossing formula relating Gromov-Witten theory to the theory of quasimaps, a relationship that is closely related to the famous physical phenomenon known as mirror symmetry.  In future work, she will extend this wall-crossing formula to new cases and use it to attack another physical conjecture: the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence.  She will also work, in collaboration with Alexandr Buryak (University of Leeds) and Ran Tessler (ETH Zurich), toward the theoretical development of a version of r-spin theory for curves with boundary, with an ultimate goal of generalizing Witten's r-spin conjecture to that setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Online learning systems, such as Massive Open Online Courses and Intelligent Tutoring Systems, aim to contribute to the society by providing high quality, affordable, and accessible education, at scale. They highly impact advancement of the national prosperity by preparing skillful professionals for high-demand jobs. Delivering such high-impact goals requires automatic tools that can help us understand students' learning process and answer questions such as what knowledge is gained by watching a video lecture (domain knowledge modeling), what is a student's state of knowledge (student knowledge modeling), and how a specific student would perform on a test (predicting student performance). Ideally, these tools should model student's learning from various learning material types (such as problems, readings, and video lectures) and capture the knowledge span offered by combinations of gradable and non-gradable learning resources. However, the current tools are limited to a single type of learning material (typically, ""problems""), ignoring the heterogeneity of learning materials from which students may learn. This project aims to achieve a better understanding of students' learning process in online educational systems by presenting an integrated research and education plan (1) to model student interactions with both gradable and non-gradable learning material types, (2) to integrate the proposed models with learning material content, and (3) to evaluate the proposed models by experimenting with real-world online educational datasets. The project will provide learning and research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>To achieve the goal of improving students' learning process in online educational systems, the researchers develop multi-view machine learning algorithms that minimize the error of student performance prediction while maximizing the correlations among multiple views of the learning data. In the first year of this project, using activity sequences of students a model will be built that can capture a shared latent knowledge space among sets of gradable learning material and non-gradable ones. During the second year of this project, content information of learning materials, including expert labels, will be included in the learning model in order to improve it. This model aims to discover the relationship between content information and the shared latent knowledge space. The project results are evaluated using the task of predicting student performance. This project is at the intersection of domain adaptation, sequence modeling, and educational data mining. The model is inspired by Canonical Correlation Analysis as an approach for transferring information and adapting various views to student activity data, while modeling student learning process as a sequence of knowledge acquisitions. This is a novel treatment of the student modeling problem, with a sequential domain-adaptation view, that facilitates future research directions, such as personalized education and improved student retention in online learning environments. This work contributes novel sequential and content-aware domain adaptation and multi-variate analysis models that combine information from multiple sequential data sources and time-invariant content resources at the same time. While motivated by the task of student knowledge modeling, the models are general and can be applied to a broad spectrum of research including domain adaptation problems and recommender systems. The developed solutions will be presented in journals and conference venues, and the project website will provide access to the results, with references to code for the developed and evaluated models that will be available at GitHub.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To have  physical reality  they have to possess  properties  which  make them detectable to observations. Chief among them is stability to perturbations. This translates to a very difficult, deep and beautiful mathematical conjecture which is the main  focus of the proposed   research.  The goal is to show that any  small perturbation, at a given time, of a given black hole solution remains small for all later  times. Thus all the important features of a unperturbed black hole are preserved by the perturbations.<br/><br/>To solve the problem of stability of black holes one has to overcome a large range of difficult issues. The high non-linearity of the Einstein  equations makes it hard to separate them; they are all interconnected.  At the heart of all these difficulties is the issue of gauge. That means, roughly,  that one cannot solve the stability problem without finding a specific coordinate system  in which  one can  establish decay of the perturbations, i.e. to show that the perturbations converge to zero for large times. In collaboration with J. Szeftel in France the PI had proposed a new method to construct these coordinates  based on the full covariance properties of the  Einstein equations.

In 2004, a single-atom thick layer of carbon, called graphene, was extracted from a piece of graphite. Subsequently many other two-dimensional crystals have been discovered. This rapid phase of material discovery has been fueled by the interesting and unusual properties of the two-dimensional layered crystals that are, not surprisingly, very different from those of conventional three-dimensional crystals. In addition, disparate layers of these crystals can be stacked to make designer materials with unique properties. Owing to their surface-only character, the interactions between two-dimensional crystals with their immediate environment become more important than similar interactions for bulk crystals. The immediate environment may include ambient gases and the substrates. These interactions can alter different properties of two-dimensional crystals in unpredictable ways, but have remained mostly unexplored. In this project, the PI and her group will use state-of-the-art computational methods to study interactions between two-dimensional materials and their local environment, advancing the field of layered materials. In the process, they will develop a fundamental understanding of factors influencing the structural, electronic, magnetic and optical properties and hence, the physical and chemical behavior of two-dimensional materials.

Different properties of novel layered systems are only beginning to be understood and the field requires detailed atomistic studies to explain the functionalities of these materials. Due to their very nature, it is important to explicitly consider: (a) interfacial effects between two-dimensional materials and their substrates, whether conventional three-dimensional or two-dimensional substrates on one side, (b) interfacial effects between layered-materials and the atmosphere to which they are exposed on the other side, and (c) how defects within the two-dimensional layers alter the interfacial interactions, and in turn, are themselves modified due to the interfaces. These effects have, thus far, been mostly overlooked in theoretical studies of novel layered two-dimensional crystals, but are expected to play an important role in determining their properties. Using Density Functional Theory-based computational methods, the PI and her team will address this gap in our knowledge by explicitly including the relevant local environment, and will therefore determine how the properties of layered structures are affected by it. The emergent properties from these composites will help to understand existing experiments and will be exploited to propose novel, technologically-relevant devices using two-dimensional structures as building blocks. The PI's research team will study these effects in context of different applications, such as: (a) quantum emitters in layered two-dimensional crystals for quantum technologies, (b) phase-change properties of transition metal dichalcogenides for nanoelectronics and next-generation batteries, and (c) highly-selective and sensitive biochemical sensors.  Such applications have potential to benefit society. <br/><br/>While pursuing the research goals for this project, the PI will also support and enhance educational activities at the Howard University.

Yang<br/>Proposal Number: 1826621<br/><br/>Raw natural gas contains various concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas, which needs to be reduced to a concentration below 4 parts per million in the US. Conventionally, natural gas desulfurization is accomplished by contacting the gas stream with a liquid stream that absorbs the H2S.  Although the liquid absorption process is technologically mature and has been used for nearly 100 years, it is highly energy intensive and is also plagued by equipment corrosion and solvent loss problems.  Adsorption is a technology that is ideally suited for gas purification, provided an efficient sorbent with high adsorption capacity and H2S-selectivity is found. In this work, new approaches for synthesizing amine-grafted silicas with superior sulfur capacity will be developed.  Results of this project may guide the design of a new, more efficient process for natural gas desulfurization.  This project will involve active participation of a diverse group of graduate as well as undergraduate students, particularly minority and female students.<br/><br/>Amine-grafted mesoporous silicas are currently the best desulfurization sorbents because they have good sulfur capacity and selectivity, high moisture resistance/stability, fast uptake rates, and regenerability; however, the sulfur capacity needs to be further improved to make adsorption competitive to the liquid scrubbing process. Amine grafting is accomplished by the reaction between the surface hydroxyl groups of silica (i.e., silanols) and an aminosilane dopant.  The approach used in this work is to increase the silanol density on the mesoporous silica, thereby directly increasing the grafted amines and consequently the H2S capacity.  The work includes three basic strategies to increase the silanol density.  The mesoporous silica MCM-48 will be the main silica to be used because of its high BET surface area (~1400 m2/g).  Other silicas such as SBA-15 (with large pores, 7-20 nm) and MCM-x with expanded pores will also be used. The three strategies are all scalable and environmentally sound, outlined in three tasks: 1) new and improved organic-template removal processes; 2) post-treatment (i.e., after template removal) of the mesoporous silica in a hydroxyl abundant environment; 3) in-situ synthesis of mesoporous silicas with maximized silanol densities.  Task 1 is the main task, which includes five sub-tasks aimed at new template removal processes to increase silanol density: microwave digestion; special gaseous oxidants; supercritical extraction; extraction using organic solvents and ionic liquids, and nonthermal (""cold"") plasma.  The resulting mesoporous silicas with the highest silanol densities will be subjected to aminosilane grafting and H2S adsorption/desorption measurements including both equilibrium adsorption isotherms and rates. Because the results of the three strategies may be synergistic, the PI will study combined treatments during the later phase of the proposed work. This work will lead to the development of superior H2S adsorbents that may enable adsorption technology to replace the wet amine absorption technology that is currently used for natural gas desulfurization. The increased use of clean natural gas--compared to coal and oil--will help mitigate global warming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compared with conventional fossil fuel combustion devices, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) hold great potentials for both transportation and stationary grid applications since they are cleaner, more affordable, and more reliable; they run with renewable hydrogen fuel; and they demonstrate high efficiency with minimized carbon emission. This project aims to develop an emerging class of nanostructured materials with one-dimensional architecture and core/shell structure which can maximize the benefit of PEMFCs. The rational design and precise preparation of such nanomaterials can significantly advance the understanding of both materials design and synthesis for efficient and cost-effective PEMFCs and many other applications, including batteries, electrolyzers, and electrochemical sensors. The outcome of this project can accelerate the large-scale application of PEMFCs, potentially transform the United States energy portfolio, and establish an eco-benign energy society. An education plan is designed to be integrated with research activities to promote teaching, training and learning at several levels, covering K-12, undergraduate and graduate students. Parts of the activities include educational outreach involving underrepresented minorities. The project can attract, build and retain a high-quality next-generation workforce in catalysis, energy technology and other science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>    Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), based on renewable hydrogen sources, play a critical role in establishing a sustainable and clean hydrogen energy economy to reduce our society's dependency on conventional fossil fuels and the related combustion technologies. Advanced PEMFCs suitable for large-scale transportation and stationary grid powers demand a nanostructured material that can be used to accelerate the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a high activity over a sufficiently long period of time and with minimized platinum group metal usage. The objective of this project is to design and synthesize one-dimensional core-shell nanocrystals with non-precious-metal cores, by precisely controlling their core-shell material compositions and physical parameters (e.g. lengths of one-dimensional nanorods, core-shell interfaces, and shell profiles), to fundamentally understand the correlation of atomic level nanocrystal architecture to the favorable electrocatalytic properties. The Principle Investigator leverages the expertise in nanomaterials synthesis, structural characterization, electrochemistry and theoretical calculation, to primarily focus on four tasks: (1) Rationally designing and synthesizing cobalt phosphide-platinum core-shell nanorods with controlled lengths and shell profiles; (2) Tuning the core-shell interface and structural arrangements; (3) Optimizing the efficiency of nanocrystals by using transition metal doped cobalt phosphide nanorod cores; and (4) Understanding the design rules for optimized ORR conversion through a combination of electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational approaches. The generated knowledge accelerates the development of new forms of nanomaterials by exploiting the mechanism controls of synthesis at the atomic level and uncovers how to correlate and control their functional activity and structural stability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental idea is to understand the extent to which global objects can be arithmetically determined by the collection of its local pieces. The strategies and techniques that will be utilized in this project originate in a broad range of other mathematical subjects, including analysis, geometry, algebra and in some cases, statistics.

First, the PI will conduct research that furthers the statistical study of class groups that originated with the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics; amongst others, this will include proving asymptotics for class groups of families of orders. Second, the PI will study number field distributions and the local-global principles that can control their asymptotics, beginning with the case of octic quaternion number fields. The strategy for obtaining such results will rely on arithmetic invariant theory, sieve methods, and geometry-of-numbers techniques utilized frequently in the field of arithmetic statistics. On the automorphic side, the PI will investigate arithmetic and geometric properties of p-adic families of Galois representations arising from non-conjugate self-dual regular algebraic automorphic representations of the general linear group over CM fields.

The research addresses three main areas of inquiry:  (1) elucidation of the mechanisms of gold to alkene carbene transfer by modeling the transition state for carbene transfer, independent synthesis of gold metallacyclobutane complexes, and  kinetic analysis of gold to alkene carbene transfer under stoichiometric conditions; (2) evaluation of the nature and reactivity of cationic gold alpha-oxo carbene and carbenoid complexes by studying the reactions of gold complexes with stabilized N- and S-ylides and the reactions of pyridine N-oxides and with cationic gold complexes;  and (3) interrogation of the structure and reactivity of unsaturated gold carbene complexes through the synthesis and characterization of cationic gold allenylidene and vinyl carbene complexes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this goal, the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University offers the REU site, entitled Launching Aerospace's Underrepresented Students into the Next Chapter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (LAUNCH-UAS). There are four objectives for this site: (1) provide students with cutting-edge summer research experience in UAS, (2) expose students to aerospace research projects and engineers, (3) develop students' research and professional skills to prepare them for graduate programs, and (4) provide students with opportunities to build a community of mentors for graduate programs and beyond. The LAUNCH-UAS site will bring together URM students and a broad range of members of the aerospace engineering community to break down barriers for URM students to participate in the aerospace field. Potential benefits to society as a result of this site include: developing well prepared, motivated URM students who want to pursue aerospace engineering graduate programs and enter the workforce; educating aerospace engineers who are knowledgeable about opportunities within aerospace academia and industry and will eventually serve as inspiring mentors to future generations of URM engineers; and sharing key components and lesson learned from the LAUNCH-UAS site to the broader U.S. colleges and universities.<br/><br/>Through a 10-week summer LAUNCH-UAS site, URM students will have an opportunity to conduct research on operation and autonomy aspects of long-endurance UAS. Students will participate in one of multiple independent research projects relating to UAS, such as developing onboard hardware that continuously monitors essential UAS components for safe and autonomous operation; model and simulate low-altitude traffic management systems for autonomous UAS; model and simulate the operation of UAS and examine their ethical, legal, societal, and environmental implications; develop an inductive charging capability for supplying power to UAS while in operation; design, build, and experiment with onboard spray systems for UAS and characterize the spray droplets; develop low-power anti-/de-icing techniques and examine various icephobic coatings for safer long-term autonomous UAS flights; and create an educational module that increases engineers' awareness of ethical issues surrounding the operation of UAS. In addition to conducting independent research on UAS, students will participate in a number of LAUCH-UAS site components that include professional development workshops, field trips and lab tours, research luncheon seminars, and social activities. There is also a series of assignments intended to give students opportunities to prepare presentations and documents typical of those that they would be expected to complete as independent researchers and as graduate students.<br/><br/>This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, the results of applying even simple rules many times may be complicated and hard to understand (think of a simple motion of a spoon in a cup of coffee; after a few repetitions the liquid is completely scrambled). It is well known that small disturbances can have rapid growth, as for example in the ""butterfly effect"" in meteorology.  Other systems where complicated effects take place include the motions of small celestial bodies subject to the changing forces of the sun and the planets. In some cases (for example, in the motion of satellites) it is of interest to devise maneuvers that take advantage of the natural amplification of disturbances to accomplish big effects with small efforts. To understand such complicated behavior, this research project searches for pieces that move in an orderly way and that act as anchors and reference points for all the other motions. This allows systematic classification of the possible motions. <br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, this project will employ methods from several parts of mathematics. The fact that an object behaves simply can be formulated as a functional equation that can be studied with rigorous mathematics using functional analysis and topology. One surprise in these studies is that delicate number-theoretic properties (for instance whether a frequency satisfies a polynomial equation with integer coefficients) play a practical role. The tools from functional analysis must be supplemented by a very strong geometric intuition. The project also aims to develop practical algorithms for calculation, so that the knowledge acquired in the theory can be made concrete. The mixture of tools (analysis, topology, geometry, and numerical algorithms) makes involvement in the project an effective training ground for students who can subsequently pursue either academic or industrial careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is concerned with topics in harmonic analysis that are designed to provide efficient  mathematical tools for these disciplines and that are expected to contribute to the unification of seemingly unrelated areas. Of particular interest is the study of various integral transforms, such as the Fourier and the X-ray transforms, and some  of their relatives. The Fourier transform decomposes a signal (mathematically a function) into the frequencies that make it up. It has been found to be relevant for solving  many mathematical problems arising in science and engineering and can be regarded as a special case of a larger class of oscillatory integral operators. The X-ray transform is an  operator that assigns to a function its integral over lines. It is relevant to problems in medical imaging and can be considered as a special case of a larger class of Radon type transforms and averaging operators. A main goal of the project is to expand the current mathematical toolbox in harmonic analysis to contribute towards a deeper theoretical understanding of these integral transforms and their generalizations.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will work on several projects in harmonic analysis. The first project is concerned with the application of decoupling theory to regularity questions for averaging operators and generalized Radon transforms, and to boundedness problems for  associated maximal functions. The second project deals with a new multiplier problem for Haar expansions in spaces of Hardy-Sobolev type, in  ranges where the Haar basis is not unconditional. The third project investigates spectral multipliers for the Kohn Laplacian on the Heisenberg group and the behavior of the corresponding multiplier transformations on Lebesgue spaces. It is proposed to prove  new space-time estimates for solutions of the wave equation associated with the Kohn Laplacian and to use them to bound the multiplier operators. The principal investigator will also work on other projects, related to almost everywhere convergence of Bochner-Riesz means, local improving inequalities for maximal functions with  application to sparse domination results, and boundedness of multilinear singular integral operators.

Many classical problems of probability theory are devoted to understanding the patterns that are generated by random noise in high-dimensional systems. For example, suppose one has a large matrix each of whose entries is the outcome of an independent fair coin flip, i.e., the matrix is filled with noise. What do the eigenvalues of such a matrix look like? Such questions have beautiful answers that are now well understood. There are however many situations, both in pure and in applied mathematics, in which there is nontrivial structure underneath the noise. For example, in the random matrix problem, we could allow each entry to have an arbitrary variance that reflects the intensity of the corresponding variable. The challenge in such problems, which are much less well understood than their classical counterparts, is to capture the interplay between the structure and the noise. The aim of this project is to develop mathematical techniques that make it possible to address such questions in considerable generality. Beside their fundamental interest, such techniques are expected to be applicable to areas such as statistics and computer science where high-dimensional random structures play an important role. Several education and outreach activities further form a key part of this project.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop new mechanisms and techniques in high-dimensional probability to address problems that could be broadly characterized as having nonhomogeneous structure. The fundamental question in such problems is: how is the underlying geometric structure reflected in the probabilistic behavior of the model? Such questions are of significant importance in various pure and applied mathematical problems. This project aims to systematically investigate such problems that arise in three interrelated themes: (i) the norms of nonhomogeneous random matrices (for example, with arbitrary variance or sparsity pattern); (ii) the geometry of nonhomogeneous random processes (such as those that arise, for example, in random matrix theory or in functional analysis); (iii) geometric inequalities and dimension-free phenomena (for example, in connection with measure concentration or convexity).

Active hydrothermal vent sulfide chimneys are hotspots of biodiversity and productivity in the deep ocean, as well as potential resources for metals. While significant effort has focused on understanding the diversity of biological communities and geochemistry associated with actively venting SMS, relatively little is known about the biological communities associated with SMS once venting ceases. Furthermore, little is known about the microbiological and geochemical changes that occur during the transition period from active to inactive, during which an important succession occurs in the microbial community and geochemistry of fluids within the chimney. This interdisciplinary project will create and sample this transition period by collecting multiple active SMS samples from individual vents at 9 degrees N East Pacific Rise and allowing them to transition to inactive on the seafloor, mimicking the end of venting while allowing for the exact time when venting ceased to be known, something not possible when sampling naturally formed inactive SMS. Microbial community diversity and metabolism will be analyzed in parallel with bulk and fine-scale geological measurements for active, transitioning, and inactive sulfides. This seafloor experimental and analytical approach will provide knowledge of how microbial communities, rates of biogeochemical transformations, and geological conditions change as SMS transition from hot and actively venting to cold and inactive. Students in grades 6-8 will be entrained into the project through research cruise ""ship-to-shore"" interactions and communications, post-cruise workshops for educators working with students typically underrepresented in STEM fields, and a collaboration with the Science, Engineering, Art and Design Gallery (SEAD), a community and economic development project in Bryan, TX. <br/><br/>Hydrothermal vents are quantitatively important to the biology and chemistry of the deep ocean, but the vast majority of current knowledge focuses on actively venting deposits. However, after venting ceases, sulfides can persist on the seafloor for tens of thousands of years, making them long-lived, globally-abundant microbial substrates. In recent years, studies of inactive SMS found drastically different microbial communities than those on active deposits, indicating a succession of the microbial community, and thus a potentially different impact on deep ocean biodiversity and biogeochemistry than actively venting deposits. However, ages of the inactive structures are often not known, so it is impossible to estimate how quickly these changes occur, and how quickly co-occurring changes in sulfide mineralogy and microbiological communities occur. This project will provide the first insight into what happens at the microbial and mineralogical level as SMS initially transition from active to inactive. Active SMS will be sampled and analyzed for microbial community composition, functional capacity, gene expression and metabolic rates. Co-located subsamples will be analyzed for porosity and bulk and fine-scale mineralogy. Subsamples of those active SMS samples will be left on the seafloor to incubate and be collected weeks and a year or more later, with the same analyses conducted upon collection. This will allow for determination of microbiological and mineralogical changes that occur during that initial transition and for comparison with older inactive SMS from the same vent fields. Together, the data collected will be integrated to generate a conceptual model of succession of biology, mineralogy, porosity and pore distribution as vent deposits transition from active to inactive. This project will fill a knowledge gap about hydrothermal ecosystems and has the potential to transform the current understanding of diversity and rates of change in these important seafloor biomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, if reflective symmetry is available, then computations can be cut in half: only half of the object is needed to understand it fully. Conversely, a lack of symmetry can also limit whether a material or object can possess a certain property. The overall theme of this project is to better understand certain groups of symmetries by studying how they transform a one, two, three, or higher dimensional space. This is well-understood when working with algebraic spaces based on the real numbers, but much more complicated when working in the modular case, that is, when real numbers are replaced by a finite number system that depends on a fixed prime number. Modular arithmetic is computationally easy and very useful; for instance, it forms the basis of modern algorithms in coding theory and cryptography. However, the problem of understanding and classifying how symmetries transform algebraic spaces in the modular case is more difficult than for real numbers and is not as well-understood. Broadly speaking, this project will study symmetries of algebraic spaces in the modular case. <br/><br/>More precisely, much of the representation theory of a reductive, connected algebraic groups is encoded in affine Hecke algebras. Affine Hecke algebras have two geometric interpretations: equivariant constructible sheaves on the affine flag variety and equivariant coherent sheaves on the Steinberg variety. These two interpretations are known to be equivalent when working with characteristic zero sheaves. In the modular case, this is not yet known. However, if it does hold, one would expect certain structures on the coherent side that have yet to be defined. The PI will define exotic t-structures on derived categories of coherent sheaves for varieties similar to the Springer resolution and extend the powerful theory developed for intersection cohomology sheaves to the coherent setting. The PI will also define an Iwahori--Whittaker model for the Satake category. Finally, the PI will explicitly construct some central sheaves (those associated to tilting representations) in the mixed affine Hecke category. This project will strengthen the current categorical understanding of the affine Hecke algebra which, will aid its application to modular representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will seek to develop electrode catalysts that are able to dissociate molecular nitrogen, the rate-limiting step in conventional Haber-Bosch synthesis, while simultaneously showing low activity for hydrogen recombination so as to achieve a high hydrogen fugacity at the electrode surface.

The project will explore mixed electronic-protonic conductors that can be added to the electrode to enhance the three-phase boundary where the electrochemical reaction can occur. The choice of electrocatalysts will be guided by complementary theoretical studies. Small-scale demonstration cells will be produced.

Despite this success, Axial Volcano is inherently 3-D in nature, thus requiring a 3-D approach to map the complex connections between the magma plumbing system at depth with eruption dynamics at the seafloor. For example, this approach is needed to understand (1) how 3-D fracture sets are associated with magma inflation/withdrawal, rifting, and gravitational spreading/collapse in the upper crust; (2) the geometry and interconnection of complex magma bodies of varying amounts of melt/mush; (3) the relationship between internal structure and seafloor observables such as hydrothermal fields and lava flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applications of image processing are ubiquitous. They range from analyzing medical images, such as CAT or MRI images, to forensic sciences, face recognition, satellite imagery, speech recognition (acoustic imaging), etc. All of these applications are underlied by fast mathematical algorithms that do the work of image enhancement and restoration.  To measure the difference between images, numerical methods under consideration in this project use a so-called ""earth mover's distance"" (in a more general context it is known as the Wasserstein metric). This is a novel application of the earth mover's distances that promises a substantial speed-up of image processing algorithms. Training, advising, and mentoring of graduate students toward their doctoral degree is intertwined with the research tasks of the project. The project will support at least 3 graduate students, two of them female students.<br/><br/>This research is concerned with several diverse analytical topics; the mathematical analysis is unified through techniques of geometric measure theory. The numerical methods to compute the earth mover's distance are based on a regularization and a minimization over a class of vector fields satisfying a boundary condition. However, there is currently no theory confirming either the existence of minimizers or the convergence of the regularized problem to the original one. These questions will be addressed by using techniques of calculus of variations, gamma convergence, and the theory of traces of divergence-measure vector fields to deal with the boundary condition. Simultaneously this project will consider several unresolved problems concerning the theory of divergence-measure vector fields. Another important aspect of the field of image processing to be investigated is the advancement of methods of evaluating the image noise pioneered by Rudin, Osher, and Fatemi (the ROF model). The research of this project will also include analysis of models for segregation of populations using non-linear elliptic equations, with the goal to understand the free boundaries that separate the populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Relatively little is known, however, about how software development teams in the early stages of design use relevant information such as customer behavior and competing products to generate creative ideas for product requirements, nor how different kinds of information might affect their creativity. This project will study how expert software designers engage with design information in the early stages of software development to develop an ""Information Archetypes Framework"" that characterizes design information and its influence on design creativity.  This framework will be validated through studying the performance of student design teams that are given different types of information to support product brainstorming activities.  In addition to improving understanding of design creativity and cognition from a research perspective, the project team will conduct collaborative workshops with local software development and startup companies to discuss how to effectively navigate complex information to enhance their competitiveness.  The project will also have significant educational impacts through training student researchers, informing the design of innovation-enhancing activities for software engineering students, the development of a broader curriculum on innovation in information technology, and supporting outreach through immersive summer programming workshops aimed at increasing middle school girls' knowledge and interest in STEM and design-related careers.<br/><br/>The research component of the project has two main elements.  The first aims to expand on an initial version of the Information Archetypes Framework that characterizes the source, abstractness, and generality of information, as well as team styles for problem solving and sharing information.  To do this, expert software designers will be asked to attend a design session and given a short design problem along with carefully crafted pieces of information that are relevant to the problem domain and correspond to the dimensions identified in the current version of the framework.  The project team will ask each designer to organize the information and explain how they made judgments about the relatedness and potential usefulness of the different pieces of information for design, using a combination of quantitative analysis of the similarity judgments and qualitative analysis of interview responses to revise the framework.  The impact of the revised framework on design creativity will then be investigated by developing a similar design problem for an introductory design class in an information technology innovation program, giving each student team a unique set of relevant information corresponding to each type of information identified in the revised framework.  The project team will use a protocol analysis of each team's interactions to analyze how these differences in available information affect communicative content and processes, along with an existing framework for measuring the novelty and quality of generated ideas in order to link differences in available information to the teams' design outputs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Post-selection inference refers to the question of valid statistical inference performed after a model selection procedure has been utilized. Higher-order asymptotics provide the tools and insights needed to refine basic large-sample results for post-selection inference procedures and make them more accurate and powerful, even when the scientist only has access to small to moderate sample sizes. WHOA-PSI seeks to merge these fields, foster collaboration and discussion, and push forward the post-selection inference research frontier in the direction of higher-order accuracy and more powerful inference procedures. NSF funding will support junior researchers attending this conference.<br/><br/>This workshop attempts to address the needs of applied statisticians utilizing model selection procedures who also need extremely accurate and powerful inference procedures with theoretical guarantees. Topics from post-selection inference include selective inference after variable selection, high-dimensional and post-regularized inference, inference after change-point estimation, and simultaneous inference. Some talks will focus on methods from higher-order asymptotics, which can yield insights and improvements to post-selection inference procedures, including series expansions, saddlepoint approximations, and bootstrap-based refinements. Additional talks will present important applied problems for which new post-selection methods are needed. Examples include statistical genetics, neuroscience, and finance.

The significant interaction between these areas has recently begun with ""applied"" algebraic topology, finding a wide range of applications in sensor networks, bioinformatics, computational chemistry, manifold learning, linguistics, and cosmology. This is due to the fact that many of the data set handled by applied topologists are based on a random sample from a larger population or contain different types of errors. Failure to capture the stochastic nature of topological data can result in a serious misunderstanding of the topology of the system. For example, the layer of extraneous topologies triggered by heavy-tailed errors, as a phenomena analogous to that of audio crackle in temporal signal analysis, will make it very hard to recover an underlying topology of the system. Another example includes topology on non-Euclidean spaces, especially those negatively curved. One good motivation for this study lies in its tree-like structure as a result of negative curvature. By virtue of this structure, the resulting non-Euclidean model can potentially be employed for analyses of various complex networks in physics, computer science, and cosmology. Combining topological concepts with the notion of randomness, this projects aims to properly understand random topology of the system. <br/> <br/>This project addresses research questions on random algebraic topology. Despite its recent development, most of the studies on random algebraic topology do not pay sufficient attentions to how heaviness or lightness of the tail of probability distributions affects the topology. One of the main focuses is on topological crackle - the layered structure of topological elements, typically caused by a heavy-tailed distribution. Although topological crackle has been recognized, at least empirically, in the statistical manifold learning, this project investigates it thoroughly from a probabilistic viewpoint. In light of the involvement of heavy-tailed distributions, extreme value theory (EVT) will be selected as a main tool for this study. Relying on EVT, the PI aims to establish a theoretical foundation for a graphical descriptor of the birth and death of topological cycles, called persistence diagram. One of the main focuses is on the random configuration of points in the persistence diagram by regarding them as a random closed set and discussing their asymptotics in terms of the Fell topology. As the second main topic, the project attempts to investigate random topology on the negatively curved non-Euclidean space. The PI mainly deals with a theoretical question: How do the parameters of the hyperbolic space, including its negative curvature, characterize the random topology? As expected, new phenomena will be uncovered that are never seen in the usual Euclidean setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intermetallic phases-compounds formed upon alloying metals together-represent a rich source of such materials, as the periodic table offers virtually infinite possible combinations and ratios of metallic elements. However, the realization of useful applications based on intermetallic phases is limited by the inability to control their often complex and unpredictable geometrical arrangements at the atomic level. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, is promoting the progress of science through the creation of chemical principles for understanding the crystal structures of these materials and eventually guiding them in ways that enhance a desired property.  Theory is used to identify ways that the different aspects of atoms (such as their sizes and ways of bonding) can cooperate to stabilize structures and facilitate transformations between structures.  These conclusions then guide the experimental discovery of new compounds, with their structures and behavior providing feedback for theory.  In addition, this project continues the development of online resources that make solid state and materials chemistry accessible for the public, including the living textbook ""Interactive Solid State Chemistry"" (available as part of the Chemical Education Digital Library), and ""Science through Comics"". The project also provides educational experiences for undergraduate researchers as well as an internship for a high-school student from a demographic group underrepresented in the sciences each summer.         <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  The structures of intermetallic phases - solid state compounds derived from metallic and metalloid elements - are known to be governed by the same chemical properties as molecules:  electron counts, atomic size requirements, and electronegativities. However, in contrast to molecular chemistry, no broadly applicable predictive schemes for guiding intermetallic structural chemistry through solid state synthesis has been realized yet, which is a limiting factor in utilizing the full potential of these compounds as applied materials. This project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, draws on recently developed theoretical tools for visualizing strains in atomic packing and local electron configurations in intermetallics to build a conceptual framework for predicting structural phenomena in these compounds: the Frustrated and Allowed Structural Transitions (FAST) model. Here, potential rearrangements of a parent structure are divided into those that are frustrated or allowed, depending on whether the primary factor driving the transition (either atomic packing or electronics) is supported or impeded by the respective second factor, with allowed transformations predicted to be readily realizable experimentally. Using a combination of theory and experiment, the principle investigator's research group tests and refines this model through the anticipation and discovery of new structural progressions (including diffusionless phase transitions) and the selective stabilization of shallow metastable structures in binary systems through elemental substitution. Therefore they examine a vast range of intermetallic structures through the FAST approach in search of hallmarks of responsiveness in the electronic and packing factors (the violation of electron counting rules and intense chemical pressure features, respectively). Those phases for which previously unobserved structural chemistry is deemed allowed by this model are prioritized for experimental investigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This unique interaction leads in turn to important advances and novel ideals in both disciplines. It also promotes a new way of thinking combining mathematical rigor with the physical insight and flexibility of string theory. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to make significant advances in the refined Donaldson-Thomas theory of orbifolds as well as develop a new approach to cohomological invariants of moduli spaces of sheaves on Calabi-Yau threefolds.

However, scientific understanding of our increasingly urban world is limited by the availability of historical data documenting these ecological changes. This project partners the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CM) with the Mid-Atlantic Megalopolis (MAM) Project, a Thematic Collections Network (TCN) involving 11 institutions in the urban corridor from New York City to Washington, D.C., to digitize herbarium specimens from the Mid-Atlantic states. Western Pennsylvania is widely recognized as an urbanized area that was transformed from an industrial powerhouse (and one of the most polluted metropolitan areas in the 19th and 20th centuries) to an emerging center for sustainability and technological innovation. This partnership will fill a ""Rust Belt"" data gap by including urban areas in Pennsylvania that have undergone remarkable environmental and ecological change over the past two centuries. CM specimens will enhance the MAM Project by adding nearly 190,000 herbarium specimens, increasing the total number of MAM specimens by more than 25%. In addition to making these valuable specimens more accessible through public databases, targeted activities will directly connect digitized data to scientists and the public, contributing to ongoing programs in invasive species management, education of nature in the city, and museum exhibition. Taken together, these activities will improve scientific and public understanding of urban environments, highlighting sustainability and the future of this increasingly common biome in the current era of global change.<br/><br/>This project connects an unrepresented, but important, Mid-Atlantic urban region to the MAM Project. Digitization of each CM specimen will result in a high-resolution image and georeferenced point, enabling biogeographic, floristic, and phenotypic analyses through space and time. Data capture, efficient workflow development, and data dissemination will follow best practices, utilizing the existing project infrastructure of the MAM project and iDigBio. Data on non-native species will be made available to PA iMapInvasives program to track the introduction and spread of harmful invasive plants in the region. Further, this project will integrate specimen images into museum exhibits, with the construction of a new exhibit highlighting specimen-based research, the importance of digitization, and the ecological and economic value of plants in cities. In collaboration with museum educators, specimen images will be used in the development of an online toolkit of free science activities for local school teachers that explore nature in urban settings. Weekly blogs will feature specimens of local interest, focusing on the urban plants of Pittsburgh. Collaborating with MAM partners, workshops will be held for local botanical clubs and citizen scientists in the Pittsburgh region to the assist in digitization, specifically joining the efforts of established projects focused on shifts in flowering times across the Eastern US and the development of a virtual flora of the Mid-Atlantic. Collectively, the project will provide research-ready data to enable a better understanding of human-mediated changes at multiple biological, geographic, and temporal scales, as well as predictions for the future ecology of urban areas.

Such advances related to engineering design and life cycle assessment have been demonstrated through case studies, but rigorous methods are needed for systematic inclusion of ecosystems in engineering decisions. This work will advance the framework of Techno-Ecological Synergy (TES), with specific focus on developing methods for, 1) integrated design of chemical processes and ecosystems on and around manufacturing sites while accounting for their temporal and spatial variation, 2) including ecosystem services in life cycle assessment (LCA) by means of a rigorous mathematical framework, 3) education and outreach activities to improve knowledge about ecosystem services among students and practitioners.<br/><br/>Local TES design at a manufacturing site will be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem that accounts for spatial and temporal variation of these systems such as the intermittent availability of many ecosystem services versus the continuous demand for these services from human activities.

The technical community is currently hard at work attempting to construct such ""quantum"" computers. While many mysteries about these devices remain, it is certain that a large-scale quantum computer would easily break all current public-key cryptography that underpins the current Internet. In certain attack models, important examples of private-key cryptography would also be rendered insecure. This 3-institution collaborative project studies the basic theoretical issues underlying these urgent threats to the security infrastructure. It seeks to understand the cryptography-breaking power of quantum computers, concentrating on two interweaving themes: quantum security for 1) authenticating, and 2) constructing quantum-secure cryptography from new primitives.  The project activities also include course development and mentorship at the graduate and undergraduate level. The project also involves specific outreach activities intended to broaden participation in Computer Science, including establishment and development of ""women in computer science"" chapters, outreach to local high schools, workshops for high-school STEM teachers, and development of computer science courses for a general audience at the three partner institutions.<br/><br/>Authentication-proofs, for example, that an e-mail really did originate from you--is a basic and well-studied cryptographic challenge. In the setting of quantum adversaries, it is not clear how to appropriately formulate this essential notion, let alone produce specific cryptographic tools that achieve it. This project is addressing both of the challenges noted above, focusing on development of strong formulations of authentication and new cryptographic constructions that offer secure authentication. Finding ""hidden"" algebraic structures--like the fact that two lists of numbers are merely cyclic shifts of each other--is an emblematic theme in the study of the computing power of quantum computers. Certain variants of this problem have resisted decades of concerted effort by the quantum algorithms community, and appear to be quite difficult. This project studies applications of these problems to constructing new private-key cryptographic tools with quantum security guarantees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students interested in STEM careers will likely encounter or work with systems that utilize UASs, both in school and in their work, as the market and range of applications continue to grow. UASs also provide a potentially fun and creative way to approach, learn, and work with concepts and design aspects of several critical STEM subjects including math, mechanical and electrical engineering, physics, and computer science. This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site program aims to provide teachers with research experiences related to UASs, particularly commercially available quadcopters (4-rotor drones) and their applications, and to assist the teachers in developing curricular materials that connect topics in math, science, and technology classes to real applications. The project will connect teachers with university researchers, education professionals, and industry engineers to explore how drones work, the math and science involved in controlling a drone, and constructing a drone to carry payloads, survive crashes, and ignore interference from cell phones, radio-controlled vehicles, cell towers and other radio frequency sources. Providing teachers with training in STEM subjects through research experiences and assistance with the development of UAS-based curriculum elements will allow teachers to connect material to realistic problems to better engage students and help the teachers pass along problem solving skills to their students. This, in turn, better prepares students for the 21st century business and technology environment which strongly values the ability to solve problems effectively and efficiently, and achieves a STEM aware and capable workforce.<br/><br/>The University of Tulsa (TU), in partnership with Tulsa Regional STEM Alliance (TRSA), will conduct an RET Site based on the operation and application of quadcopter UASs, addressing the major fields of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. The Site will invite 10 Tulsa-area high school teachers each year for a period of two years to conduct research and curriculum development activities at TU for six weeks during the summer months. The program will also engage Tulsa Technology Center (TTC) for teachers and for follow-up activities. TU and TRSA will partner to disseminate the results of activities, including curriculum modules, activities for follow-on quadcopter-based STEM camps, program evaluations, both locally and nationally. State and local industry will benefit from students trained in problem solving and STEM disciplines and better prepared to fulfill high-skill, higher paying jobs.

Structural measures for flood control, such as levees, are constrained to only a small part of a watershed, and are limited in their capacity and robustness to reduce floods. Communities need flood control solutions that provide more storage in the watershed, are flexible to trends in precipitation and land use changes, and are environmentally sustainable. This project will explore an approach for flood control that is based on the dynamic management of water storage in wetlands across the landscape. The strategy will enable adaptive release of water from wetlands hours or days ahead of rainfall events, thereby maximizing storage capacity while at the same time maintaining or increasing wetland ecological function. <br/><br/>The specific objectives of the project are to: (1) determine the ecological consequences of manipulating the hydroperiod (water depth changes over time) for wetland communities typical of Harris County, Houston; (2) create a set of modular active controls for dynamic management of storage in wetlands, and (3) examine how the size of wetlands (area and usable storage) in relation to the watershed area, and the degree of water storage management, impact the magnitude of floods at the watershed-scale. To minimize ecological impacts, constraints on water level reductions will be included in the management strategy. Tasks for Objective 1 include conducting a mesocosm field experiment that will determine the ecological consequences of a wide range of hydroperiod manipulations for wetland communities typical of Harris County. This will both assess the ecological impacts of desired hydrological manipulations (drawdown before rainfall events) and also of management mistakes (rainfall events that fail to materialize as predicted). Tasks for Objective 2 include field tests of a set of modular active controls for the remote operation of a network of wetlands for water storage management. Tasks for Objective 3 include (a) performing a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach for reducing the magnitude of floods; and (b) creating a Decision Support System (DSS) for evaluating the impact of dynamic water storage management on the magnitude of floods at the watershed-scale.

Despite its long history, our understanding of this subject remains unsatisfactory. In the 19th century, E. Galois introduced the idea of studying numbers via the equations that they satisfy, whose (discrete) symmetries are captured in the notion of Galois groups. In the 1970s, Langlands proposed a far reaching web of conjectures which relates these Galois groups to a completely different kind of symmetry, namely the (continuous) symmetries seen in vibrations on highly symmetric shapes (automorphic forms). Progress on particular cases of these conjectures has already led to spectacular achievements, such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, the proof of the Sato-Tate conjecture, solutions of many new Diophantine equations, etc. An emerging theme from these developments is that one can fruitfully study Galois groups (and hence whole numbers) by packaging the information they contain into continuous families, and strikingly these spaces are related to ideas from quantum physics. This project aims to further this circle of ideas, which is essential to make further progress in the Langlands program.<br/><br/><br/>More specifically, the project studies the structure of the moduli space of p-adic representations of Galois groups of p-adic fields. This is achieved by modelling deformation spaces of Galois representations with p-adic Hodge theory conditions in terms of spaces studied in Geometric representation theory, especially affine Springer fibers. This creates new links between two different highly-developed and active fields of mathematics. As a result, on one hand, geometric techniques can be used to make substantial progress on major problems in the mod p Langlands program such as Serre weight conjectures, the Breuil-Mezard conjecture, and local-global compatibility problems; on the other hand, insights and  heuristics from Galois theory can be used to discover and study new phenomena in modular representation theory and geometric representation theory. Furthermore, the project opens up many concrete questions, both theoretical and computational, which make excellent research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Molecules possess energy according their different modes of motion, for example how they move through space (translational), how they vibrate, and how they rotate.  Molecular energy also includes the energy of the electrons within the molecules.  Prof. Ng has developed a novel instrument that can produce molecular ions (molecules with negative or positive charge, for example H2O+ or O2+) with precisely known translational, vibrational, rotational, and electronic energies.  These ""state selected"" molecular ions are then reacted with other neutral molecules, and the reaction products then provide insight into how the different types of molecular energy influences their reactivity.  Prof. Ng's research may make it possible one day to control chemical reactions based on the distribution of energy within the molecules.  This project involves the development of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser sources and novel laser spectroscopic techniques.  As such, the project is providing an excellent education opportunity for training the next generation of researchers in laser spectroscopy and dynamics. <br/><br/>The current focus of the experiment is to perform absolute integral cross section measurements for a variety of ion-molecule reactions involving quantum-rovibronic-state-selected ions such as N2+, H2O+, H2+, and O2+. Due to the recent success in preparing vanadium cation in long-lived V+ (a5DJ), V+ (a5FJ), and V+ (a3FJ) spin-orbit and electronic states, Prof. Ng's group also plans to examine quantum-state-selected measurements for the reactions of vanadium ions. The neutral reactants to be included in this study are Ne, Ar, H2, HD, D2, O2, N2, CO, NO, HCN, H2O, D2O, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H4, C4H2, C6H6, CH3OH, and NH3. These ion-molecule reactions play a pivotal role in the catalytic function of transition-metal cations complexes and the understanding of the chemistry occurring in planetary atmospheres.

It is aimed at developing, refining, testing, and validating a prototype to illustrate the synergy among formative assessment (FA), computational thinking (CT), and self-regulated learning (SRL) within the discipline of computer science (CS) with teachers (n=10) and students (n=160) in 9th-12th grades. The project will focus on FA, also known as assessment for learning, which generates information that is used for feedback to modify teaching and learning activities. By explicitly eliciting student SRL learning during problem-solving, assessment tasks will illustrate the synergy between FA and SRL. Students will be prompted to analyze a CT task before attempting to solve it, explicitly setting goals, and reflecting on teacher feedback to direct their behaviors towards achieving these goals in subsequent attempts. To elicit SRL behavior, CT task design will follow a three-phase model. Phase 1 will focus on goal setting and task analysis. Phase 2 will focus on self-monitoring during task performance, while Phase 3 will center on reflection. Each task will have two performance iterations, allowing students and teachers to put feedback about prior performance into use. Tasks' content will be drawn from the CS curricula used in secondary school classrooms. They will be validated in authentic classroom contexts in a public school system with a diverse student population. This effort plans to achieve the following outcomes: (1) creation of four prototype CT assessment tasks; (2) development of reliability and validity arguments for the tasks; (3) research into impacts on student CT performance of process-oriented teacher feedback and explicit use of SRL; and (4) development of teacher expertise in FA of CT. <br/><br/>The project will address two key research questions: (1) Does teacher feedback positively affect student performance when it provides goal-specific feedback on SRL processes, as well as performance outcomes?; and (2) Do students who engage in SRL cycles improve performance on CT tasks, as compared to students who complete tasks without explicit prompts to engage in SRL? To answer these questions, the project will conduct two research studies. The first study will investigate the extent to which teacher feedback on both SRL processes and task performance positively affects student CT achievement, more than outcome-based feedback only. This study will use a quasi-experimental, pre- post-test design with comparison group. Students in the treatment condition will receive feedback on SRL processes and CT task performance. Students in the control condition will receive feedback on performance outcomes only. The second study will investigate the extent to which students who engage in SRL through explicit prompting improve performance on CT tasks, as compared to students without SRL prompts. This study will employ an experimental mixed-model design to examine differences between experimental groups and changes in students' performance over three repeated measurement cycles. The main outcome of this effort will be a prototype illustrating the potential synergies among CT, FA, and SRL which will be used in the future to further research on the intersections among these domains.

In these systems, some of the electrons are excited. There is coupling between the lowest energy electronic state and higher energy excited states. Chemists refer to the dynamics of these systems as ""nonadiabatic"" molecular dynamics. Nonadiabatic dynamics are important in biological processes, for example cellular respiration and photosynthesis.  They are also important in emerging technologies such as energy storage and photovoltaics.   These systems also very difficult to simulate because nonadiabatic dynamics are inherently quantum-mechanical.  Truly quantum calculations have a very large computational cost which puts them beyond the reach of even the most advanced currently available computers.      Computer simulations of classical molecular dynamics, however, are cost-effective for large and complex molecular systems.  The Geva group is developing a methodology for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics accurately and reliably at classical-like computational cost, using what is called a ""semiclassical"" approach.   Dr. Geva is also involved in activities to modernize and improve the physical chemistry curricula and to further develop a new Compute-to-Learn pedagogy.<br/><br/>The methodology combines the quasi-classical mapping Hamiltonian approach for modeling the electronically nonadiabatic dynamics of a multi-state molecular system with the generalized quantum master equation, for describing the reduced dynamics of the electronic degrees of freedom, and optical response theory, for calculating nonlinear time-resolved spectral signals. The synthesis of the above-mentioned three components (the quasi-classical mapping Hamiltonian, generalized quantum Master equation and optical response theory) leads to a powerful methodology, which is necessary to bridge the gap between theory and experiment. It does so by allowing one to calculate experimentally relevant quantities like electronic transition rates and nonlinear time-resolved spectral signals in an accurate, cost-effective and self-consistent manner, starting from explicitly molecular models, where the dynamics of the nuclear degrees of freedom is governed by anharmonic electronic-state-specific force fields. Method development takes place in the context of several model systems with increasing level of molecular detail, including two-state donor-acceptor benchmark models, models of photosynthetic reaction centers and models of triads and dyads in liquid solution. It should be noted that the above-mentioned methodology is general and not limited to the systems in the context of which it is being developed. The methods are disseminated broadly via publications, presentations in professional meetings, collaborating with experimental groups and the Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation NSF program. Group members receive extensive training that prepares them for an independent career in an academic institution, government lab or industry. This research program also contributes to the university teaching mission via strengthening the relationship between computational and experimental groups, modernizing curricula of physical chemistry courses, and advancing a new Compute-to-Learn pedagogy within a peer-led honors studio where students registered to introductory physical chemistry undergraduate courses create interactive computer demos that demonstrate physical chemistry concepts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

OLEDs(organic light-emitting diodes) employ thin films of organic semiconductors to convert electricity to red, green, and blue lights necessary for displays. In this project, principal investigator Daniel Frisbie is seeking to understand the properties of single crystals of organic semiconductors that have applications in other types of devices such as organic field effect transistors (OFETs). For OFETs, charge velocity is critically important, but structural defects in crystals can trap electrical charges, lowering their average speed. Professor Frisbie aims to determine what types of defects exist in organic semiconductor single crystals using a powerful high resolution microscopy technique called scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM). SKPM images electric potential and many types of defects in crystals have a ""voltage signature"" that can be detected. Frisbie will use SKPM and a combination of other characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy to locate defects, to determine the structural nature of defects and to characterize their electrical properties. The work should lead to a better understanding of structure-property relationships in organic semiconductors and thus enable expanded real-life applications. An important broader impact will be the training of graduate students in organic semiconductor materials science and device physics.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The goal of this project is to advance the materials science of organic semiconductors by elucidating relationships between mechanical strains, defects, surface potential, and electrical transport in single crystals of pi-conjugated molecules. The experimental plan builds on prior work in the Principal Investigator's (PI's) laboratories that demonstrated surface potential imaging by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) is surprisingly sensitive to defects and inhomogeneous strains in crystalline organic semiconductors. The PI seeks (1) to understand the causes of the strain/defect-surface potential relationship, (2) to demonstrate its relevance to broad classes of crystalline organic semiconductors, and (3) to establish the relationship between surface potential variations and electrical transport. The research focuses on organic single crystals as their low levels of disorder facilitate identification and analysis of precise structure-property relationships. Single crystals of benchmark organic semiconductors are grown by vapor transport and characterized with a spectrum of methods including SKPM, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The PI employs a robust platform to apply strains to crystals inside operating SKPM, UPS and XRD instrumentation. Strains ranging from 0.01-0.5% are applied this way, which allows for precise quantitation of the mechanical strain-surface potential relationship. In a second direction, the PI is uncovering the causes of step edge potentials so far observed in a handful of organic semiconductor single crystals and correlates the potentials with field effect (FET) transport. In a third vein, he examines the impact of planar defects induced by solid-solid phase transitions on the surface potential of organic crystals and correlates the results with FET performance. The work is leading to a deeper understanding of structure-property relationships in organic semiconductors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students interested in STEM careers will likely encounter or work with systems that utilize UASs, both in school and in their work, as the market and range of applications continue to grow. UASs also provide a potentially fun and creative way to approach, learn, and work with concepts and design aspects of several critical STEM subjects including math, mechanical and electrical engineering, physics, and computer science. This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site program aims to provide teachers with research experiences related to UASs, particularly commercially available quadcopters (4-rotor drones) and their applications, and to assist the teachers in developing curricular materials that connect topics in math, science, and technology classes to real applications. The project will connect teachers with university researchers, education professionals, and industry engineers to explore how drones work, the math and science involved in controlling a drone, and constructing a drone to carry payloads, survive crashes, and ignore interference from cell phones, radio-controlled vehicles, cell towers and other radio frequency sources. Providing teachers with training in STEM subjects through research experiences and assistance with the development of UAS-based curriculum elements will allow teachers to connect material to realistic problems to better engage students and help the teachers pass along problem solving skills to their students. This, in turn, better prepares students for the 21st century business and technology environment which strongly values the ability to solve problems effectively and efficiently, and achieves a STEM aware and capable workforce.<br/><br/>The University of Tulsa (TU), in partnership with Tulsa Regional STEM Alliance (TRSA), will conduct an RET Site based on the operation and application of quadcopter UASs, addressing the major fields of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science.

The program will also engage Tulsa Technology Center (TTC) for teachers and for follow-up activities. TU and TRSA will partner to disseminate the results of activities, including curriculum modules, activities for follow-on quadcopter-based STEM camps, program evaluations, both locally and nationally. State and local industry will benefit from students trained in problem solving and STEM disciplines and better prepared to fulfill high-skill, higher paying jobs. TU students involved in the project will develop professional and technical skills that increase their competitiveness and potentially attract them to STEM education, either professionally or through service to communities and schools.

The study of the (bilateral, translation, rotational, scaling and other) symmetries of a given chemical, physical or mathematical system is often key to its understanding, and ultimate solution, since their presence greatly constrains the system. Quantum groups are deformations of the most basic symmetries of Nature. They were discovered in the 1980s as symmetries of one and two-dimensional statistical mechanical models that describe, for example, thin layers of ice. Quantum groups have re-emerged very recently as the symmetries of four-dimensional gauge theories that describe the interaction of elementary particles such as quarks. <br/><br/>Quantum groups form a hierarchy that depends on the strength of the deformation and their dependence on a spectral parameter: constant, rational, trigonometric or elliptic. As the hierarchical level rises, an interesting trade-off occurs: some of the structure becomes far more intricate, while some simplifies radically. This project will further uncover relations that exist between different members of the hierarchy by building conceptual bridges between them. These conceptual bridges will have fundamental consequences for the quantum groups they link. On the one hand, they will give a radically simpler description of the multivaluedness of the differential or difference equations for one quantum group in terms of its hierarchical superior. On the other, they will give a self-contained description of the latter in terms of the former which, in addition to clarifying its structure, has potentially far reaching arithmetic consequences. More precisely, the present project will explore the relations between affine quantum groups. One main theme of the project is to extend the description of the monodromy of the rational Casimir connection of a symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebra, in terms of quantum Weyl group operators, to numerical values of the deformation parameter, and to the difference analogue of the connection. The second main theme of the project is to use the meromorphic tensor equivalence of finite dimensional representations of Yangians and quantum loop algebras, and of quantum loop algebras and elliptic quantum groups, to compute the monodromy of the trigonomeric Casimir connection and of the rational and trigonometric qKZ equations, thus proving the difference analog of the Drinfeld-Kohno theorem conjectured by Frenkel and Reshetikhin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These findings provide an opportunity to transport charges to desired locations without a loss in Gibbs free energy.  Particular focus wiis being given to address the following fundamental questions: How can molecular structure be tuned to control intermolecular electron transfer?  Is there a correlation between self-exchange reactions in fluid solution and those on oxide surfaces?  Does self-exchange electron transfer between dyes influenced unwanted recombination reactions?  Can self-exchange with molecules that contain two (or more) redox active groups be controlled by the bridge that links them?

This variability can be seen in the shift in the distribution in stock market, in the income distribution, in the electoral map, in the levels of a river or of the waves. All the data arising from these phenomena are considered to be non-stationary. Non-stationary data, as a rule, cannot be easily modeled and studied. The results obtained by many of the existing models may be spurious. They may indicate a relationship between two variables, where one does not exist. In order to apply consistent, reliable results, the rigorous mathematical tools have to be constructed for non-stationary data. This research has double scope. First, it will contribute to a better understanding and modeling of the non-stationarity phenomena and, in addition, will build new, reliable tools for their forecast and their long term behavior.<br/><br/>An important technique for establishing limit theorems for nonstationary sequences and random fields is to approximate them with well understood structures, such as martingales and ortho-martingales. Motivated by the study of asymptotic properties of nonstationary evolutions the theory of nonstationary martingale approximations will be developed. This theory is fundamental for obtaining new projective criteria for nonstationary stochastic processes and for random fields that ensure maximal inequalities and asymptotic results, including the conditional functional central limit theorem and limit theorems started at a point for multi-indexed evolutions. The processes to be studied are very general. They include random fields with long memory and therefore they are useful to model data arising from many applied fields, such as data from economics, social sciences or engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of group theory is motivated by the desire to understand the symmetry of an object, whether it be in nature, art, communication networks, or any other place that symmetry might play a role.  Finite group representation theory has applications in physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences, and in recent years, research in group theory and other algebraic areas has also had a significant impact on technological advances, such as in cryptography and coding theory. Representation theory is a tool used to better understand the structure of a group and the symmetries it represents. Roughly speaking, representations provide a way to view an abstract group as a collection of matrices whose structure is often easier to understand. This project focuses on a number of problems that seek to relate the representation theory of a finite group to the structure of the group, which in turn may give more insight into the real-world objects whose symmetries are encoded in these groups and have implications for the various applications of group theory. Several of the problems under consideration involve computations and other components that are well-suited for involving undergraduate students and introducing them to group theory and mathematical research, and the investigator will recruit, encourage, and mentor students to pursuing research activities related to this project.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project is focused on irreducible characters of finite groups of Lie type, which make up the largest collection of finite simple groups.  It involves relating the character theory of a group to that of certain subgroups, through local-global conjectures and irreducible character restrictions, in addition to relating character fields of values to properties of conjugacy classes of the group. Several of the questions in the project aim to further the current knowledge in the field regarding the action of Galois automorphisms on characters of groups of Lie type.  Since the effect of various group actions on parametrizations of these characters is an especially problematic component in a number of local-global conjectures and other main problems regarding the representations of groups of Lie type, this is of interest to many other problems in the area. In particular, part of the project concerns Navarro's Galois-McKay conjecture for groups of Lie type, as well as studying reality for conjugacy classes and characters of groups of Lie type.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Comprehensive optical sensing (determination of absolute configuration, enantiomeric purity and concentration of chiral substrates) is to be achieved using conceptually new molecular recognition and chiral amplification strategies.

In cities, humans have intensively reconfigured the landscape and extensively concentrated resources. These urban environs are expected to host almost all future global population growth. If and how cities will remain livable in the future, however, is a critical question.  Key factors of livability include a comfortable environment, access to and efficient use of water, and resilience to extremes of drought, flood, cold, and heat.  Natural science suggests that these factors are strongly related to the vegetation cover, soils, and heat and water balances of a place, but it is an open question how precisely lessons from natural science conducted in rural, natural areas might apply to cities. Among the most prominent, unique characteristics of cities are their extreme spatial variations in land cover (e.g., grass, pavement, trees, gardens, and bare ground juxtaposed over short distances) and the phenomenon called the urban heat island (UHI). An UHI occurs where an urban area is substantially warmer than nearby rural areas due to factors such as greater absorption of solar energy by paved surfaces and less evaporative cooling from dry urban surfaces than rural fields or forests. This project will determine (1) how urban landscape variations, heat, and water balances interact as cause and consequence of local hot or cool microclimates within the city, (2) how microclimates and their vegetative and hydrologic influences relate to urban human health and comfort, and (3) how the overall UHI climate and hydrologic regime of cities may be made more resilient to weather extremes for the benefit of urban infrastructure, urban environmental quality, and urban human safety. To the extent that the linked surface water and energy balances of a city might be controlled by is landscape composition and configuration, with sufficient knowledge of urban heterogeneity-heat-water relations, cities could be engineered for greater health and sustainability, even in the face of global change. <br/><br/>The dual goals of this project are to (1) quantify the links and feedbacks between urban landscape heterogeneity, urban heat, and the urban water cycle and (2) to forge a strong pipeline between science, education, and management to help empower people of all abilities and positions to develop practices to enhance the comfort and resilience of urban landscapes in the face of global change. The research will address how the distributed surface water and energy balances of the urban environment function, whether they function differently in urban heat or cool islands, how they are governed by various types of land cover, and how they in turn affect water resource demands and human comfort. Research approaches will include in situ quantitative monitoring of the heat and water balances of the most common urban land covers subject to the same microclimate island and compared among different microclimates; field, remote sensing, and modeling investigation of urban soil moisture's controls on urban warming; physics-based numerical modeling of urban landscape composition and configuration controls on microclimate, surface energy balance, and surface water balance; and remote sensing and modelling assessments of how progressive urbanization and warming and the scale of data considered may influence the quantifications of urban heat and water cycles. This project will also foster research-education-management synergy with multiple open-access innovations. Urban environmental science field course modules will be developed for a variety of age levels (pre-school to graduate) to foster place-based, experiential, and life-long STEM learning. The modules will also be explicitly designed to make field science accessible to students with mobility needs. Research-management collaboration will occur among a consortium of western US cities and universities and public outreach on ""urban backyard science"" will freely distribute educational urban-environment activities for all ages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to storing the genetic code, nucleic acids can undergo chemical modification, adopt folded structures, and interact with proteins and enzymes for the regulation of gene expression and metabolism. Fluorescent nucleoside analogues are powerful probes for studying these processes, but existing analogues have limited capabilities. Insufficient knowledge of the factors controlling their fluorescence hinders the rational design of better probes. This project seeks to overcome these limitations and expand the toolkit of fluorescent nucleoside analogue probes with significant, novel capabilities. The design of the new analogues is aided by detailed mechanistic studies of how the local environment in DNA/RNA influences the fluorescence of the probes. This cross-disciplinary research provides excellent training opportunities for students at multiple levels. In addition to graduate student and undergraduate involvement, a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) in the SDSU Physical Chemistry teaching lab and an outreach program involving computational work with community college and high school students will broaden participation in the research.<br/><br/>Probably the greatest challenge in designing fluorescent probes that mimic the structure of biomolecules is that limited ability to predict photophysical properties currently necessitates a trial-and-error approach.

By harnessing these trends and synthesizing new fluorescent nucleoside analogue designs, novel probes with (a) brightness matching conventional fluorophores, (b) absorption and emission at the red end of the visible spectrum, (c) strong fluorescence turn-on responses to specific biomolecular recognition events, and (d) the ability to report on chemical modifications to nucleobases, e.g. from methylation or DNA damage are being developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The symposium brings together various NSF-funded broadening participation projects (such as NSF INCLUDES Pilots and NSF ADVANCE projects), Hispanic-Serving Institutions, as well as national professional organizations that have a focus on enhancing the participation, inclusion and success of Latinas (and other traditionally underrepresented minority groups) in STEM careers. Therefore, the symposium provides a platform for the sharing of ideas, strategies, and best practices to broaden the participation, inclusion, and success of Latinas in academic STEM careers. This work is important for society because if Latinas continue to be underrepresented, and hence underutilized in the STEM workforce, the U.S. will likely lose ground in terms of its scientific and other workforce competitive advantages. Increasing Latina representation among STEM faculty also provides the needed role models for Latina/o students to enter into STEM careers, transition to graduate programs and ultimately progress to the professoriate. Moreover, diversifying the STEM professoriate promotes innovation and creativity, and expands the range of perspectives and experiences to which students in STEM fields are exposed. Therefore, it serves to offset preconceived notions and stereotypes some students might have about women and underrepresented ethnic minority populations. <br/><br/>The NSF INCLUDES Symposium advances the knowledge and understanding of how work-life issues, policies/practices, mentoring, and climate surrounding equity and inclusiveness affect the recruitment, retention, and advancement, including into leadership positions, of Latinas in STEM academic careers. The symposium incorporates presentations by scholars engaged in emerging research on Latinas (including intersectionality issues), individual perspectives from STEM Latina faculty/professionals as well as perspectives from institutions of higher education (especially Hispanic-Serving Institutions) and national diversity-serving professional organizations such as the Latina Researchers Network.

Simulations of atomization have the potential to provide this knowledge, but have not been impactful due to the massive datasets produced and the challenges of extracting useful information.

Pharmaceutical drugs are mostly made up of very small molecules, which take their effect by binding to target biomolecules in our bodies and perturbing their functions. A major challenge in designing new drugs - such as treatments for cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease - is figuring out how to bind a particular target both accurately (with little off-target binding), and effectively (a high percentage of targets occupied by drug molecules). A key quantity to maximize the effectiveness of a drug is its ""residence time,"" the average amount of time the drug will remain in the binding site after each binding event. However, little is known about how the structure of a drug molecule determines its residence time, and this hinders our ability to incorporate residence time predictions in the drug design process.  This research will predict the residence times of compounds binding to a pharmaceutical target molecule that affects diabetic neuropathic pain, as well as test those predictions experimentally.  This study will potentially result in new treatments for diabetic neuropathic pain and also serve as a blueprint for future drug discovery efforts focused on residence time.  To facilitate adoption of this approach the team of investigators will disseminate their results via a dedicated website, online servers and participation in world-wide competitions for predicting drug binding properties. This project also involves the training of graduate students with unique interdisciplinary backgrounds, and will inform the development of graduate courses at the intersection of mathematics and biological sciences. <br/><br/>This project will develop a pipeline of mathematical and computational tools to enable kinetics-based drug discovery. The studies will be conducted on soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), an established pharmaceutical target for diabetic neuropathic pain for which only limited drugs have yet been approved. This project will use an integrated approach that encompasses topological modeling, machine learning, virtual screening, molecular simulation, as well as in vitro and in vivo assessment of compound efficacy. In PI Wei's laboratory, persistent homology will be used together with deep learning to abstract topological information from protein-ligand complexes and predict stable binding poses, binding affinities, and binding kinetics.  It is believed that the combination of topological analysis and deep learning will be transformative: it will bring a surge in similar approaches in 3D biomolecular data predictions in the near future, as well as applications to other fields, such as chemistry, and material science.  PI Dickson will use rare-event techniques in molecular modeling to simulate ligand release events, and identify the rate-limiting transition states of the ligand binding and release process. This project will also examine the robustness of ligand binding transition states for the first time, which is the key quantity to enable kinetics-based drug design.  Thirdly, PI Lee will continually assess the binding affinity and residence times of the predicted compounds. Selected compounds will be tested in vivo with a novel mouse model, to determine the limits of the benefits of long in vitro residence times. This collaborative project will achieve synergistic benefits by bringing together expertise from advanced mathematics, computational biophysics, and molecular pharmacology. The collaborative tools for sampling and prediction resulting from this work can then be applied to the discovery of novel long residence time compounds for other targets of interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technician employees earn certifications that may only be recognized at a specific company or include only a few types of testing methods. A limited number of educational institutions offer courses or programs in NDT technology. To keep up with the increasing workforce demand for NDT technicians, the nation needs more educational programs that provide complete professional preparation. To meet this need, Lorain County Community College will collaborate with two national industry associations and leading employers of technicians to identify the required skills, student learning outcomes, and best practices for NDT programs. The project has the potential to enhance the preparation of future NDT technicians to meet the need in the nation's workforce. <br/><br/>This project main goal is to develop the capacity of community colleges to educate students for jobs in the NDT technician workforce. The project will involve collaboration between Lorain County Community College, the American Society for Nondestructive Testing, the American Welding Society Foundation, and industry partners.

Both institutions will also collaborate to accomplish project activities. The collaborators will perform a job task analysis for one technician job level. The results will then be combined with existing job task analyses for the other job levels.  This synthesis aims to create comprehensive competency models for NDT technicians.

While each elementary process of the reaction is intrinsically a nanoscale phenomenon dictated by local material properties and geometry, the electrochemical properties have been mostly analyzed through bulk (volume-averaged) measurements. To obtain a breakthrough in electrode design, a more thorough understanding of the process at the nanoscale is needed.

VdW nanowires are a new category of 1D material platforms. Their highly anisotropic 1D nature makes them a perfect fit for the study of 1D physics. Fundamental questions to be answered are: 1) How is the power law of conductance manifested in strictly 1D confining vdW nanoribbons? 2) Can the transition between Tomonaga Luttinger liquid (TLL) and 1D Mott insulator be realized in vdW nanoribbons? 3) How does spin-orbit coupling (SOC) modify the transport behavior of TLLs in vdW nanoribbons? 4) Can the temperature range of the Majorana bound state be increased using SOC-enhanced vdW nanoribbons? To address these questions, the research team is conducting the following experiments, centered on vdW nanoribbons: 1) tunneling transport measurements on suspended nanoribbon, 2) momentum resolved spectroscopy on parallel nanoribbons, and 3) detection of the Majorana bound state in semiconducting vdW nanoribbons. This project establishes a new frontier in low-dimensional material research. The pure 1D nature of vdW nanoribbons enables experimental studies in the 1D limit of the single molecular chain. The exploration of critical aspects of 1D electron transport helps to advance the understanding of electron behavior in strictly 1D systems and benefits the theoretical development of 1D transport physics. The measurement methodology proposed in this study applies directly to devices using other novel 1D materials and inspires device research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project investigates growth rates of arithmetic invariants related to the symmetry groups of algebraic equations in infinite families. This work was begun in the 1950's by Kenkichi Iwasawa, who conjectured that many such families have a well-defined asymptotic behavior. The proofs of such ""main conjectures"" have been at the forefront of algebraic number theory. To date, research has focused on first-order estimates of growth rates. The goal of this project is to study the higher-order terms, beyond their first-order terms. This will lead to more precise measurements of the growth rates in question. The project's broader significance is that it will provide a better understanding of important methods in algebraic number theory that have in the past led to the development of technology essential to society, such as the improved compression and secure transmission of data.<br/><br/>Iwasawa theory has played an essential role in the development of modern number theory and arithmetic geometry. This project concerns a new frontier in the subject, namely the study of the higher-order terms of Iwasawa and Selmer modules. One focus will be on conjectures about when the first-order terms are zero and what one should expect for the leading terms in such cases. A main goal is to formulate a general framework for studying higher-order terms in Iwasawa theory using a two-step approach: The first step is to define a ""large"" Selmer module via the Galois cohomology of a motive or a family of Galois representations; the second step is to impose local conditions on the cohomology classes to produce a ""small"" Selmer module. Greenberg formulated a ""main conjecture"" in this generality, which can be thought of as concerning the first-order term of the small Selmer module. The overall goal of this project is to develop a higher-order term Iwawasa theory in the same generality and to explore its consequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will investigate questions in extremal combinatorics that involve additional structure, with a focus on algebraic, number-theoretic, and topological structure. The project will also address questions of a Ramsey-theoretic nature that additionally have additive-combinatorial, algebraic, and ergodic-theoretic connections. Finally, the project will pursue various connections between problems in these areas. Specific questions to be attacked include a topological Dirac-type theorem for hypergraphs, investigating product-free sets living inside free structures, improving bounds for a few Ramsey-theoretic results of an additive-combinatorial flavor, and investigating the Ramsey-theoretic properties of non-abelian groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The limiting objects, which are usually characterized by certain symmetries and spatial independence, capture the universal large-scale behavior of many models. In the last few decades, there have been great advances in random planar geometry, especially in the understanding of some fundamental two-dimensional discrete models and their scaling limits. These developments hugely expand our knowledge on the randomness of basic objects such as curves, functions, trees, and surfaces. They also revolutionize the mathematical understanding of some central pieces of physics, including conformal field theory, critical phenomena, and quantum gravity.  This project aims to broaden understanding of the fundamental mathematical underpinnings in this subject.<br/><br/>The project will explore two research directions in random planar geometry. In the first direction, the project aims at linking two ways of constructing random surfaces: (1) through the scaling limits of random planar maps; (2) through a continuous theory called the Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). The investigator plans to prove a conjecture asserting that LQG is the scaling limit of random planar maps in a strong sense. As a tool for proving this conjecture, the project considers a statistical mechanical model called the critical percolation and aims to establish that the scaling limit of the critical percolation on the uniform random triangulation and on a regular triangular lattice are the same. The ingredients in both investigations include: (a) combinatorial bijections for planar maps that encode their geometric information; (b) a relation between fractals in quantum and Euclidean geometry called the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov relation; (c) the Fourier analysis of Boolean functions. In the second direction, the investigator aims to resolve questions in the geometry of random planar maps, computational geometry, and fractal geometry. The common theme in the approaches is the application of two recently-developed machineries in continuous random planar geometry called imaginary geometry and mating of trees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To work properly, critical environments need special air handling, mechanical systems, security features, waste treatment, decontamination systems, and programmable controls. Many facility technicians are not trained to work with critical environment applications and other common mechanical or automation systems. The region surrounding Manhattan Area Technical College in Kansas has an increasing demand for technicians to maintain critical environments. This local demand is driven by the biotechnology, life science, and animal health laboratories in the area, as well as the new Department of Homeland Security?s National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility. To meet this need, the college will develop certificate and associate degree programs focused on teaching students the skills and knowledge they need to operate and maintain critical environments. The program will be the first of its kind, and thus has the potential to serve as a model for other institutions. <br/><br/>This project will develop courses for a certificate and an associate of applied science degree in critical environments engineering technology. The curriculum will incorporate industrial safety and maintenance engineering topics in combination with biosafety principles. The instructional design of the program will offer two pathways to meet the specific needs of different students.  Students could take individual modules to fill specific training needs, or complete a curriculum to obtain a certificate or degree. The individual modules will be stackable to encourage students to work toward completion of their education. The program will emphasize a hands-on approach to integrate behavioral-based training methods in a simulated biosafety laboratory environment. This laboratory environment includes building automation systems technology with core mechanical applications such as air handling, welding, hydronics, and construction. The program will directly support workforce needs in regional industries. It can also provide professional development opportunities to incumbent employees, so they can add the skills needed to work in critical environments. The project also aims to strengthen the safety, compliance, and operations of the growing number of industries and companies that use critical environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Separately, computational advances driven by p-adic analysis have had, and will continue to have, a transformative effect on the study of arithmetic-geometric objects and their associated L-functions, by opening up vast new territories for empirical observation.

To meet the needs of growing regional industries such as Forum Energy, Halliburton, Cleco, and Data Communications, this project is designed to provide industry-recognized credentials to students through the Certified Production Technicians curriculum and examinations. These credentials will be combined with the hands-on experiences needed to be successful in a competitive labor market. The project aims to prepare both faculty and students for these examinations and to produce graduates who are Certified Production Technicians.  This certification has the potential to reduce initial training time and hiring cost for employers. Graduates with Certified Production Technician certification will have knowledge about the most recent safety issues and solutions, making them more competitive for available jobs. Rigorous evaluation methods, data, and feedback will inform continuous project improvements and program enhancements through the implementation period.

Genealogical trees for small parts of the Tree of Life are called `phylogenies' by biologists; there is more interest in phylogenies today than at any time in the past. Phylogenies are crucial in fields such as epidemiology where they are used to track the spread of infectious disease and molecular biology where they are used to understand how molecular pathways developed. The `Tree of Life' can be discovered by comparing the characteristics of different organisms. Traditionally, phylogenies were reconstructed by comparing anatomical traits across different species. More recently, DNA sequence information from individual genes, or even full genomes, are compared to estimate phylogenies. This project will continue the development of the RevBayes computer program that biologists use to reconstruct phylogenies. The program takes as input the comparative information from the organisms of interest. The output of the program is the probabilities of the best phylogenies that explain the comparative data. Specifically, the project will improve the speed, usability, and reliability of the program.<br/><br/>RevBayes is the successor of the MrBayes program which is widely used by biologists to estimate phylogeny. However, the RevBayes program represents a significant departure from MrBayes. The RevBayes program implements an R-like language to describe statistical models. The model is represented in computer memory as a graph in which the vertices of the graph are the parameters and the edges represent the dependencies between parameters. RevBayes uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to approximate the posterior probability distribution of parameters. This project will improve the RevBayes program in several signficant ways: (1) unit and integration testing will be implemented to improve the reliability of the program; (2) computational resources, such as multiple cores or GPUs, will be taken better advantage of, to improve the speed of the program; (3) a cross-platform graphical user interface will be developed to improve the usability of the program; (4) output will be bundled to improve the reproducibility of the program; and (5) the program will be made to work with other software programs, to improve its interoperability.

Numerous practical everyday-life issues, as well as fundamental scientific mysteries, can be expressed in geometric terms. For instance, networks are ubiquitous in our modern society. From the World Wide Web and its powerful search engines to social networks, from telecommunication networks to economic systems, networks represent a wide range of real world systems. They can naturally be seen as geometric objects by considering the number of edges of the shortest path connecting two nodes as a quantity measuring their proximity. The study of physical laws has led as well to the development of a refined mathematical framework where elaborate geometric structures are able to depict and model the interactions of elementary particles and the symmetries underlying quantum physics. The notion of a metric space is a central concept that is pivotal in mathematical models of optimization problems in networks, and in a vast range of application areas, including computer vision, computational biology, machine learning, statistics, and mathematical psychology, to name a few. This extremely useful abstract concept generalizes the classical notion of an Euclidean space, where the distance from point A to point B is computed as the length of an imaginary straight line connecting them. The heart of the matter usually boils down to understanding whether a given metric space, in particular a graph equipped with its shortest path distance, can be faithfully represented in a more structured space, typically a Banach space with some desirable properties. Our ability to do so usually has tremendous applications.<br/><br/>The problems investigated in this project are motivated by their potential applications in theoretical physics and theoretical computer science. Most of the problems considered find their origins either in practical issues (e.g. the design of efficient approximation algorithms), or in fundamental mathematical problems in topology or noncommutative geometry (e.g. the Novikov conjecture(s), the Baum-Connes conjecture(s)). Embedding problems that arise in connection to these problems have been considered independently by several groups of mathematicians (Banach space geometers, geometric group theorists, computer scientists...). An underlined aspect of this proposal is to consider these embeddings problems from a unified and global standpoint. Fundamental and long-standing open problems in quantitative metric geometry (e.g. Enflo's problem, a metric reformulation of uniform smoothability, the coarse embeddability of groups and expander graphs into super-reflexive Banach spaces...) will be tackled from a different angle with new and innovative techniques. In particular, the project will develop a certain asymptotic theory of Banach spaces and explore its connections to the geometry of infinite graphs. The approach here to solve the local problems above, is to study asymptotic counterparts of the local properties involved, in order to gain new insights and to devise new approaches. This approach is motivated by the fact that the asymptotic setting usually provides a finer picture, is on some occasion better understood, and requires completely different techniques. A general outline of the research methodology of this project is to utilize powerful tools from surrounding fields (graph theory, probability theory, Ramsey theory...), and cross-over techniques (e.g. techniques from theoretical computer science to solve geometric group theoretic problems).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The November 14, 2016 Kaikoura, New Zealand, magnitude 7.8 earthquake shook up this thinking about fault slip behavior. In what initially seemed to be an event resulting from slip along a single fault, turned out to be more complex with slip jumping from one fault to another within a network of faults called the Marlborough fault system. In this project, a research team from the University of Southern California, United Kingdom, and New Zealand will use a variety of cutting-edge methods to reconstruct the slip and paleo-earthquake history of one of the Marlborough fault system faults, the Kekerengu-Jordan fault system, which experienced about 12 meters of slip in the 2016 event. Data collected in this project would be used in conjunction with data from other faults in system to better understand earthquake recurrence rates and, more importantly, the temporal and spatial linkage between these faults, something that was clearly not well understood before the Kaikoura earthquake. Understanding the threat from major earthquakes to an increasingly urbanized American population is of critical importance for facilitating proactive and efficient measures to reduce future loss of life and property. Yet understanding of what to expect in terms of the occurrence of large earthquakes in time and space remains severely limited by the current lack of information about how entire systems of inter-connected earthquake faults store and release seismic energy in large, potentially damaging earthquakes. Comprehensive data sets, such as those that will result from this project will reveal how the major faults in a fault system interact with one another to generate potentially damaging earthquakes. These kinds of observations will, in turn, allow for better forecasting of what to expect from similar fault networks in the United States, particularly in earthquake-prone California, but more generally for all of the major faults that underlie large parts of the country. The project has potential to benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes through full participation of women in STEM, increased public scientific literacy with STEM through outreach activities, improved well-being of individuals in society by better understanding of fundamental processes underlying earthquakes that would improve the capability to model earthquake hazards, development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through graduate student training, and increased partnerships through international collaboration.<br/><br/>The primary aim is to advance understanding of the collective behavior of regional fault networks, particularly the importance of emergent phenomena such as earthquake clusters and strain transients that may not be expected in the current understanding of earthquake physics and that are not accounted for in current seismic hazard assessment strategies. Mounting evidence suggests that the occurrence of large earthquakes on both single faults and fault systems is not a random process, with increasing observations of temporal and spatial earthquake clustering, changes in incremental fault slip rates, variations in fault loading rates, and potentially coordinated waxing and waning of slip on mechanically complementary faults in regional fault systems. Although a thorough understanding of both the causes and generality of such phenomena is of basic importance for fault mechanics, earthquake physics, and more accurate assessment of seismic hazard, evaluation of the importance of these behaviors has been severely data limited. In particular, there are too few comprehensive paleo-earthquake and incremental fault slip rate data sets to fully assess the collective behavior of major plate-boundary fault systems in time and space. This study focuses on the Pacific-Australia plate boundary in northern South Island New Zealand in order to document a complete latest-Pleistocene-Holocene (15 ka-present) record of incremental plate boundary slip encompassing all major structures in the system. The research team will build on previous work by developing robust records for the Kekerengu-Jordan fault system, an 85-km-long, oblique reverse-dextral fault system, which is the fastest-slipping fault in the onshore part of the plate boundary at 25-30 mm/year. Slip on the Kekerengu-Jordan fault system generated most of the moment release in the 2016 Mw=7.8 Kaikoura earthquake. The new post-IR IRSL225 luminescence dating protocol will be used at key sites on the Kekerengu-Jordan fault system, and at additional sites located with the new post-earthquake high-resolution lidar data collected by the New Zealand government. This new luminescence dating technique provides precise and reproducible dating of carbon-poor sediments typical of those in the study area with precision roughly equal to that of radiocarbon dating. Combining incremental fault offsets and trench observations with post-IR IRSL225 dating, and carbon-14 analysis will yield detailed fault slip rates and earthquake ages along the fault system spanning individual ruptures back though several dozen earthquakes. In conjunction with existing data sets from both the onshore and offshore faults, including the subduction megathrust that underlies the Kekerengu-Jordan fault system, the research will facilitate a comprehensive, system-level analysis of plate-boundary strain release through time and space during latest Pleistocene-Holocene time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, despite decades of research, describing plant water movement remains a formidable scientific challenge, and in the absence of this fundamental knowledge, sustainable management of forests will be impossible. All type of plants, including hardwoods and coniferous trees, have core bundles of vascular tissue inside their stems. These circulatory vascular bundles are composed of hollow conduits known as xylem, or wood, that are specialized to transport water efficiently while allowing maximum resistance to drought (hydraulic safety). Sufficient water transport in plants is not guaranteed when water demand increases during hot and dry days. Under those conditions, water in wood becomes highly unstable and trees can die once an air bubble enters and spreads inside those hollow cells. By integrating modelling activities with visual and physiological processes related to air entry and air bubble formation in wood, plant water transport and resistance to drought will be established. The primary impacts of the proposed project will be to advance discovery in the field of water relations and hydraulic architecture of vascular plants by predicting tree mortality following drought, while promoting training for the next generation of scientists and educators. Results from this research can be directly used in future predictions of vegetation responses to climate. The findings here will also be of interest to policy makers, plant breeders and land managers concerned with potential drought impacts on productivity and distributions of certain species.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is to link the dynamics of embolism formation and removal under tension in xylem of woody plants starting from the bubble scale and integrating the resulting dynamics along individual conduits to arrive at whole-plant vulnerability to cavitation curves. The specific objectives are to 1) measure and model the timescale required for the gas phase induced by cavitation to fully embolize an entire xylem conduit; 2) investigate the conditions under which bubble formation can spread from one conduit to another; 3) investigate the possibility of bubble resorption under tension to occur; and 4) determine the relation between embolism formation and loss of hydraulic conductivity. To achieve the project objectives, a series of science questions will be addressed: Research question 1 (bubble scale): what are the mechanisms and dynamics of embolism formation and removal in a single xylem conduit? What is the time required for a gas bubble to completely fill and to drain a conduit for varying conduit structures and xylem tensions? Research question 2 (conduit connectivity): Is the time needed for the embolism to fill a conduit dependent on conduit size, and the rigidity of the end-wall pit membrane? Research question 3 (Up-scaling to whole-plant): Do the dynamics of bubble formation in a single conduit explain the whole organ vulnerability to embolism curves. The formulation of bubble formation and spread in transpiring plants will represent a major step forward as the theoretical computational methods, and experimental techniques are now ripe for making this progress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the rate of expansion industry's need for skilled technicians has exceeded the ability of the community colleges to find qualified instructors who have both industry and educational experience. Many potential instructors have over twenty years of industry experience but lack the skills associated with different methodologies used in classroom teaching and course management, including assessment. Faculty need expertise on methods that integrate professional skills into classrooms and laboratories. This Skills for Manufacturing Instructors project will address these needs for professional development for community college manufacturing technology instructors.<br/><br/>The project will engage all twelve Connecticut public community colleges and their Advanced Manufacturing Technology Centers. The project will develop modules and a new course that will provide faculty with the skills needed to enhance their teaching effectiveness, improve classroom management, develop high quality student assessments of learning, and strategies to increase student persistence. The proposed course and modules will assist newly hired manufacturing technicians from industry as well as provide opportunities for current instructors to learn new teaching methodologies in a higher education academic environment. Additionally, the project will organize two workshops annually on essential technical skills for the manufacturing instructors and faculty, as well as provide opportunities for certification in widely used technologies. Examples of certifications that would be supported are the National Institute for Metalworking Skills, SolidWorks Computer-Aided Design software, and SME's Additive Manufacturing Certification. Additional workshops will be offered that provide strategies for increasing the persistence of underrepresented populations in the manufacturing programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical area of the US industrial biotechnology sector is the conversion of biomass and other renewable feedstocks to high value and commodity chemicals. K. marxianus can grow at high temperature and low pH, and on a wide range of different sugars, important traits for economic bioprocesses. The project will develop new genetic engineering tools for this yeast and apply these tools to engineer the bio-production of two important classes of chemicals that are traditionally produced from petroleum feedstocks. The project will also contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the development of new educational outreach programs for high school and community college students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The overall goal is to establish K. marxianus as a platform host for the production of a broad range of biobased chemicals. Critical to advancing K. marxianus is the development of new synthetic biology tools that can rapidly create strains with multiple genome edits and that can accurately control transcription of native and heterologous genes. This project addresses these challenges by (1) developing new enabling tools and methods for rapid strain development and genome engineering in this yeast species, and (2) applying the tools for metabolic engineering of pathways leading to commercially significant native (acetate esters) and non-native (polyketide) products. Phenylethyl and isoamyl acetate are valuable fragrance/flavor compounds and are used as industrial solvents. Polyketides have significant value as pharmaceuticals, including as antibiotic, anticancer, and cholesterol-lowering drugs. The rationale behind this project is that K. marxianus is a highly promising microbial host for non-aseptic (and aseptic) bioprocesses that can convert a range of different sugars into high-value and industrially-relevant chemicals and proteins. This research is transformational because it develops new synthetic biology tools and metabolic engineering approaches to harness and enhance the native traits of K. marxianus, enabling new bioprocesses for the conversion of renewable feedstocks to valuable products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is motivated by fundamental questions that arise naturally in the study and analysis of large datasets; some examples where such questions arise include the detection of community structure in large-scale networks and the reduction of large oversampled datasets to smaller, more manageable collections from which inferences can be made.  Designing, analyzing, and studying algorithms for these tasks often rely on random graph and random matrix theory.  For example, studies have shown that many important networks (such as social networks, biological networks, and power networks) can be modeled by random graphs.  This project will develop theoretical results concerning the eigenvectors of such objects, which will help engineers and scientists implement algorithms and make reliable inferences from large datasets.  <br/><br/>This research project builds in part on the investigator's recent work to obtain a clear picture of the properties and behaviors of eigenvectors of large matrices, including those of a very discrete nature (for example, the adjacency matrix of random graphs).   Some of the topics considered include the study of eigenvectors of Wigner matrices as well as the behavior of eigenvectors for perturbed Wigner matrices.  Such questions are motivated by a diverse collection of applications including community detection, matrix completion, and matrix sparsification.  To address these problems, the investigator will develop and utilize a collection of techniques including analytic techniques (e.g., resolvent techniques, concentration of measure), algebraic tools (e.g., linear algebra), and probabilistic methods (e.g., Littlewood-Offord theory).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional analytical instruments often require a skilled operator and are expensive and bulky. This research seeks to make advances in these measurement methods by creating new electronic nanomaterials that enable the formation of highly specific chemical sensors. Key to creating selectivity in such materials is the ability to tailor the chemical environment so that they interact or react with the molecule of interest.  New chemical reactions will be developed to attach groups to carbon nanotubes and create nanowires that will conduct more or less electrical current in response to the presence of a target molecule. Sensors empowered by these new nanomaterials can be lightweight, have very low power requirements, and can be the basis of new generations of functional materials.  Nanostructured materials will be developed that detect toxic or biologically active chemicals that can be encountered in the workplace or at home. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This project will create new functional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphenes by developing/improving reactions that lead to the covalent attachment of different groups to the graphene pi-surfaces. These methods will expand the diversity of functional groups that can be attached and enable novel material concepts and functional interfaces. New functionalization methods will be developed using reactive intermediates such as fluorinated carbenes and nitrenes. We will direct our efforts by determining the impact of functionalization on the mobility of the carriers in the materials. It has been theoretically predicted that the products from carbenes and nitrenes will result in minimal perturbations to the extended electronic structure.   In addition to perfecting and extending the methods initiated previously, this program will explore the covalent attachment of more complex molecular scaffolds that can create binding sites for molecules of interest. The functional nature of the target materials provides natural transitions to impactful, real-world applications. These include transduction materials that enable wearable sensors for workers who may be exposed to harmful chemicals in chemical/polymer production and/or coating processes. Creating soluble forms of SWCNTs and graphene opens a wide range of opportunities for fabrication of organic electronics for the selective assembly at interfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The graphene encapsulated growth process, which was initially demonstrated for the synthesis of two dimensional gallium nitride, involves the diffusion and reaction of growth species within the ultrathin space that is present beneath graphene formed on silicon carbide. The research, which combines both experimental studies and molecular simulations, is aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of the synthesis process, aiming to achieve improved control and scalability, as well as to expand the technique to the synthesis of other two dimensional nitrides and oxides. The realization of large area, uniform and reproducible two dimensional nitride and oxide films impacts a range of technologies including quantum communication and computing, ultraviolet emitters and detectors and high frequency/high power electronics. The activities provide collaborative research opportunities for a graduate student, a postdoctoral scholar and several undergraduate students and also engages high school students from underrepresented groups and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.<br/><br/>Technical description: The research focuses on fundamental studies of defects and growth chemistry relevant to the synthesis of two dimensional nitride and oxide films via graphene encapsulated growth within a metalorganic chemical vapor deposition environment. Experimental studies focus on controlling the type and density of defects in the graphene layer in order to understand their impact on the adsorption and reaction of gallium and nitrogen precursors as assessed by surface chemical analysis. Collaborative research employs atomic resolution characterization techniques including scanning tunneling microscopy and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy with chemical analysis to provide detailed insights on defects and the structure and chemistry of synthesized materials. The experiments are supported by atomistic-scale simulations, which are used to study precursor thermal decomposition and adsorption on the graphene surface, species transport on and through the graphene layer and sub-surface reactions that lead to gallium nitride formation. To enable these simulations, the research team extends existing ReaxFF parameter sets to gallium/graphene systems and uses these, in conjunction with molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques, to study chemical and diffusion events. The studies also extend the technique to investigate the synthesis of other two dimensional nitrides and oxides.

A great wealth of such connections have been found indirectly through intermediate objects of an analytic nature.  The research of the PI aims to provide a window through which well-known conjectures and statements of arithmetic may be seen in a new and more direct light.<br/><br/>The PI has conjectured an intricate but explicit relationship between modular symbols and cup products of cyclotomic units.

The project aims to strengthen his conjecture and extend it and known results to higher-dimensional algebraic groups and other global fields.  This involves substantial foundational work to develop the necessary framework for the desired formulations that are the primary focus of the project.

Driven by battery costs that have declined 70% since 2012, the global energy storage market is also experiencing tremendous growth, as storage technology is integrated with renewable energy. Europe has been on the leading edge of this trend: in 2017, half of all German solar energy installations included energy storage systems, delivering a wide range of cost-saving and energy resilience benefits for customers, utilities, and the grid. The trend is being accelerated by the integration of energy storage and plug-in electric vehicles, with major German manufacturers announcing new battery storage products in 2016. However, in the next five years, the U.S. is expected to become the world's largest energy storage market, having a compound annual growth rate of 21% (IHS Market forecast).  It is expected that, by 2020, more than half of the deployments will be customer-owned systems.  To support US innovation in energy storage, industry needs technicians who have skills and familiarity in this technology area.  To meet this need, Madison Area Technical College will prepare a new group of community college instructors and technicians to work with energy storage technologies. This project will study best practices from Europe, and use the information to develop industry-validated instructional resources for community college students and faculty. The results have the potential to shape and enhance energy storage technician education efforts, and to support the greater role of the United States as a global leader in the energy storage industry.<br/><br/>The goal of this project will be to support the integration of energy storage technology into existing educational programs for energy technicians.

The project will equip a model teaching laboratory and develop courses that integrate energy storage, electric vehicle, and solar photovoltaic technologies. The teaching laboratory will serve as a platform for introduction of new curriculum for college students.

Andrew at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Division of Chemistry to develop a novel approach to fabricate textile-based electronic devices.  Approaches for blending reactive vapor coating techniques with traditional textile manufacturing routines, such as sewing, weaving and knitting are explored.  The aim is to transform familiar fabrics and threads into electronic circuit components by coating the fabric surface with conjugated organic polymers.  Currently available methods for reactive vapor coating are difficult, and not applicable to optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes.  The project investigates the chemical processes involved in the vapor deposition of conjugated polymers on fabrics and the reaction conditions which enable the growth of a solar cell or light-emitting diode directly on prewoven fabrics, thus creating robust, solar harvesting textiles.  Textiles capable of harvesting solar power can drive renewable energy into innovative new applications, such as solar-harvesting window curtains, and sewable solar energy-harvesting patches for outerwear and camping gear.

Nucleobase photochemistry following UV absorption constitutes a fundamental step in radiation induced DNA damage. The extremely efficient response of the nucleobases to absorption of ultraviolet light is often described as nature's strategy to protect the building blocks of life against UV photodamage. UV photo-selection may have played a key role in prebiotic chemistry on an early earth.

Collaboration with computational chemists will provide comparison of the results with quantum chemical modeling. Choosing low energy excitation wavelengths will make the work most sensitive to the details of the relaxation processes. This approach will make it possible to directly investigate the key mechanisms of the response of nucleobases to UV irradiation so this research will contribute to the most basic understanding of fundamental processes that govern the molecular building blocks of life.

This PEN will digitize about 40,000 marine invertebrate specimens and will contribute data on fossils from boreholes drilled by private industry, bulk specimens from Pleistocene marine terraces, specimens representing the northern extent of the Bay of California, and type specimens of fossils from across Southern California.  Throughout the course of the project, undergraduate students will be heavily involved. They will be given training and experience in museum studies earlier in their academic careers than is typical, giving them a boost for future career development opportunities. Many of the students that will be involved are from groups underrepresented in museum sciences.  Since the majority of UCR's student body are low-income and/or from underrepresented minorities, paid internships will be provided through this project to provide an avenue for some who would otherwise be unable to enter the field.  The UCRESM includes an exhibit hallway visited by about 25,000 people per year, including many of the university's tour groups.

These materials consist of individual sheets (planes) of atoms, with the sheets bonded to each other with only very weak bonds (Van der Waals type bonds). In such materials, the electrons move mainly within a sheet, producing special properties for the electron orbitals (that is, the ""quantum states"" of the electrons). It is very interesting from a fundamental physics point of view to study these orbitals of the electrons, and the orbitals have potential application in electronic devices such as low-power, high-speed transistors. An instrument known as a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (LT-STM), recently installed at Carnegie Mellon University and funded through the NSF Major Research Instrumentation program, is being used for the research. With this instrument, the individual atoms on the top atomic plane of the material are imaged, and the electron orbitals are also imaged. The research also includes: (i) study of magnetic properties of the materials, using a magnetic ""probe"" in the LT-STM instrument; and (ii) assembling of stacks of atomic sheets, containing different types of atoms in one sheet to the next. Forming such ""heterostructures"" leads to new type of orbitals for the electrons, again with potential application in variety of electronic devices. The project personnel are involved in graduate and undergraduate student training on this unique LT-STM instrument operation, as well as in assisting external users, and demonstration on nanoscience to visiting middle school children.<br/><br/>Technical Description: Initial studies are focusing on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, such as MoS2 and WSe2. Typically in heterobilayers composed of atomic layers of two different materials, the lattices in the two layers are rotationally aligned, but nevertheless an interference pattern forms due to the different lattice constants (separation between atoms) in the two layers. This pattern is found to have a large influence on the electronic states in the heterobilayer. In particular, states near the valence and conduction band edges are found to be confined within the unit cell of the interference patterns, i.e. analogous to confined states of ""quantum dots"". The relatively large size of the unit cell (about 10 nm) leads to strong confinement of the lowest energy states, leading to a very flat (width of less than 1 meV) electronic bands that are split off from the usual valence and conduction band edge. New types of physics phenomena may be manifest in these materials at low temperature, due to instabilities arising from the large density of states of the flat bands; conceivably, the confined states of the heterobilayers could find application, e.g., in quantum computing. The research effort utilizes low-temperature spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to investigate the band structures of a variety of two-dimensional materials, including heterostructures, that exhibit magnetic, superconducting and charge density wave phenomena. The spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscope offers unique opportunities for the students involved and benefits other research projects by being available to external users.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these tools were initially intended for certain problems about differential equations, they have also led to important breakthroughs in number theory. More precisely, Diophantine equations are potentially complicated systems of equations involving whole numbers, and mathematicians are interested in counting the number of solutions to such systems. Unlike waves, numbers do not oscillate, at least not in an obvious manner, but one can think of numbers as frequencies, and thus associate them to waves. In this way, problems related to counting the number of solutions to Diophantine systems can be rephrased in the language of  quantifying wave interferences. This project will further extend the scope of decouplings towards the resolution of fundamental problems in harmonic analysis and number theory. The project will make new tools accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community.<br/><br/>Decouplings have proved remarkably flexible in addressing a wide variety of problems in such diverse fields as number theory, partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. One important circle of questions that remain to be addressed concerns the decoupling inequalities for curves on small spatial balls. Also, the cone poses a lot of interesting problems, even in three dimensions. The square function estimate, the local smoothing conjecture and, the decoupling into small caps are just a few examples of related problems for the cone. Progress on these problems is likely to lead to progress on many other problems. Finally, the combination of decouplings and the polynomial method has recently led to significant progress in the restriction theory of curved manifolds.

Algebraic geometry concerns the study of solution sets of polynomial equations several variables. It is one of the oldest, most developed and active areas of research in mathematics. It has connections to many sub-fields within mathematics, both pure and applied, and also to computer science and theoretical physics. Moduli theory concerns the behavior of geometric shapes as the coefficients of the defining equations are allowed to vary. The focus of this project is the moduli of complex surfaces. These spaces have been studied abstractly in the past. This project will further study these spaces by understanding the set of natural loci inside the moduli space of surfaces that arise in geometric computations, as well as its structure. In particular, combining tools from classical algebraic geometry as well as theoretical physics, the project aims to develop a flexible machinery to work quantitatively with these loci, and to further apply this machinery to answer questions arising in the enumerative geometry of surfaces (that is, questions of the type: enumerate all surfaces that enjoy certain geometric properties). In addition to research, the principal investigator will be involved in high school mathematics competitions, will advise undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates, work to increase diversity in mathematics, and organize seminars and local conferences.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project concerns the study of the tautological ring of the moduli of surfaces (K3 surfaces, abelian surfaces, etc.). Some of the projects here concern obtaining structural results, understanding the size of the tautological rings, and developing an explicit calculus for tautological classes, expressions for natural geometric cycles in terms of tautological classes. This also leads to projects of independent interest, e.g., generalizations of a conjecture of Lehn concerning tautological integrals over the Hilbert scheme, a higher-rank stable pair correspondence, and connections with the Verlinde formula for new classes of surfaces.

While 3D printing at the macro- and micro-scale is relatively mature, achieving nanometer feature size and precision is still a challenge.  To address this, the project tackles two fundamental issues: (a) how to deliver ultra-small amounts of material; and (b) how to deliver the materials to the designed location with nanometer precision.  The project advances a new approach with novel chemistry concepts for the assembly of molecules into 3D nanostructures by design.  This approach may bring us closer to achieving controlled physical and chemical properties by controlling how the molecules are put together.  This project broadens the application of 3D printing in diverse fields, such as in nanotechnology, nanodevices and sensors, tissue engineering, and in biochemistry and biomedical research.  It also boosts the capability of additive manufacturing down to the nanometer scale and consequently enhances the competitive edge of the United States 3D printing industry.  Graduate students are trained in research methods at the forefront of nanotechnology and additive manufacturing.  Professor Liu continues her long-term collaborations with local community colleges and her international education and outreach activities.  The outreach activities include summer research opportunities and seminars to stimulate the interest of a diverse group of students in advanced chemistry education and to increase awareness of 3D printing and its societal benefits.<br/><br/>The project focuses on controlling the assembly of polymer molecules by direct writing of solutions containing designated components.  To achieve molecular level control, a state-of-the-art atomic force microscope is interfaced with a nanofluidic delivery system.  The former is an existing technology for high-resolution imaging with nanometer precision, and the latter can be considered as an ultra-small needle (opening as small as 30 nm).  The research team has recently improved the delivery of femtoliter droplets, and prior work and preliminary data have demonstrated the feasibility of assembly at the microscale level.  The project builds on this foundation.  The aim is to reduce the droplet size down to the sub-attoliter level.  Towards this end, contact time, pressure and the hydrophobicity of surfaces are modified to weaken inter-molecular and molecule-surface interactions and consequently enhance the kinetics of the assembly process.  Long-term collaborations with local community colleges continue with the designed research project, summer research program, seminar and educational activities.  These activities attract a more diverse population of students into advanced chemistry education.

Arithmetic properties of abelian varieties can be translated into arithmetic-geometric properties of the corresponding Shimura variety.

In this Innovations and Development project, Child Trends, in collaboration with Ivanhoe Broadcast News, will expand the reach of the Child Trends News Service, and rigorously evaluate its impact on viewers.  The News Service aims to build the public's knowledge of, and appreciation for, social science research and to encourage adoption of research-informed parenting practices associated with positive child development--particularly among Latino parents. First produced in 2017 through a NSF proof of concept grant, the Child Trends News Service covers actionable, child-focused, social science research.  By featuring this research on local TV news, the project expands access to evidence-based parenting recommendations.  As of February 2018, 89 stations had subscribed to the News Service, including eight stations in the top 25 Latino-serving TV markets that reach 38% of all Hispanic TV Households in those 25 markets.  This project is a response to the challenges faced by U.S. children, of whom more than one in five live in poverty.  The focus on Latino parents is in response Latinos' increasing share of all children, and that Latino children are disproportionately poor, in comparison to their peers.  The project will examine the impact of the News Service on parents who view the news reports in their homes, as well as Latino parents viewing the News Service as part of their participation in the Abriendo Puertas (Opening Doors) community-based parenting program.  This research will contribute to the knowledge base of what we know about how people access and use science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) information across settings. <br/><br/>The overarching aim of this project is to leverage commercial television news to reach populations who have historically been underrepresented in STEM education and careers. The goals of the project are to:<br/>1.	Build and manage an interdisciplinary collaborative, including news media professionals, researchers, practitioners in organizations serving at-risk families, and experts in STEM communications and Latino studies.<br/>2.	Leverage mass media news outlets to deliver social science research on children to at-risk populations, with a focus on reaching Latino parents.<br/>3.	Advance the field of informal STEM learning by exploring how the public interacts with actionable research on child development to inform their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors.<br/>4.	Expand the reach and application of the news products through strategic outreach to other stakeholders in the child development field including programs serving under-served families.<br/>To accomplish these goals, the project will further strengthen an Advisory Panel to inform content development, study design, interpretation of findings, dissemination of study results, and the transition of the project after the NSF grant period.  The project will continue to provide eight (both in English and Spanish) stories each month to TV stations and strategically grow the reach in top Latino markets.  The editorial process will be informed by surveys of Latino parents to identify topics of interest.  Through a random-assignment impact study with local TV news audiences from diverse racial/ethnic groups, the project will evaluate the impact of the News Service.  The project will use formative research methods to refine messaging and examine the potential for repurposing the videos through a parenting program for Latino parents.<br/><br/>The Child Trends News Service seeks broader impacts in three areas: increasing the public's scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology; increasing partnerships between academia, industry, and others; and improving the well-being of individuals in society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To educate students in these areas, transformative changes must be made within curricular material.  In response, Brookhaven College in Texas will engage industry to identify needed curricular revisions and will create learning modules to educate geospatial and engineering technicians about the spatial data technologies that support civil and construction engineering. By incorporating real-world, service-learning experiences into the curriculum, the project will seek to prepare technicians to enter the well-paying industries of civil engineering, commercial construction, and geospatial technology. The institution will align the new curriculum with the emerging field of constructioneering (http://constructioneering.com/) to educate construction industry professionals who are prepared to manage and integrate survey, engineering, and construction data, and to streamline construction workflows and improve project delivery. The project will also strive to create an environment that allows students to master interdisciplinary knowledge and technical skills in both engineering and geospatial technology.  The curriculum changes also aim to promote 21st century career-ready abilities that use technologies to improve efficiency and lower costs. This project is designed to serve as a national model for cross-disciplinary approaches to technology education. <br/><br/>The project will investigate recent advances in imaging, spatial intelligence techniques, and analysis technologies, and adopt and adapt those technologies into new instructional materials in two ways: by creating new content modules that serve the needs of engineering and commercial construction industries; and by integrating cross-disciplinary field experiences throughout the content modules. These field experiences may help close the identified skills gaps between current curricula and real-world rapidly advancing technology applications and allow student teams to learn and practice the knowledge, skills and abilities needed on the job.  It is expected that, as a result, technicians will understand connections between related geospatial, construction, and engineering disciplines and will be better prepared to meet the needs of construction engineering-related industries. The curriculum materials will be designed for use in community college engineering and geospatial technician education programs, as well as for professional development by the incumbent workforce. Graduates who participate in this program have the potential to become resources and role models, and may expand community partnership opportunities. In addition to serving more traditional students, the project will also recruit students from a population traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (e.g., African American, Hispanic, and low-income students) and will create curricular materials based on research on how these groups learn.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymeric materials play an essential role in addressing many technological challenges including alternative energy, medical/health, and national security/competitiveness. Broadly defined, polymeric materials are classified into two large categories: thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets have their molecules permanently connected (""cross-linked"") and as a result have excellent mechanical properties, dimensional stability, and resistance to chemicals and solvents. However, a critical limitation of thermosets is that they cannot be reshaped, reprocessed, or recycled since their molecules are permanently stitched together. In contrast, thermoplastic polymers can be reshaped and reprocessed, but they normally have lower mechanical strength, lower structural stability at elevated temperature, and poorer chemical/solvent resistances. This research presents a new chemical strategy that aims to combine the best attributes of both thermoplastics and thermosets.  Specifically, a universal strategy will be explored to introduce plasticity, reprocessability and recyclability to various polymer networks and composites through a new silicon-oxygen exchange reaction. Successful demonstration of the proposed strategy could offer significant impact on new materials development, polymer recycling and sustainability, and modern processing technologies including additive manufacturing.

This project will also enable the PI to work with the UCI Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) Program on a K-12 materials science/chemistry outreach effort with a module focusing on dynamic/self-healing polymers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The main objective of this research is to investigate silyl ether metathesis as a new, robust, and universal dynamic covalent chemistry for the design of dynamic polymeric materials. Permanently cross-linked polymers (i.e., thermosets) have excellent mechanical properties, creep resistance and dimensional stability, and chemical/solvent resistance. However, a critical limitation of thermosets is that they cannot be reshaped, reprocessed, or recycled by heat or with solvent. In contrast, thermoplastic polymers can be reshaped and reprocessed, but they normally have lower mechanical strength, lower structural stability at elevated temperature, and poorer chemical/solvent resistances.  This project describes a new chemical strategy that aims to combine the excellent attributes of both thermoplastics (reprocessability, recyclability) and thermosets (mechanical strength, creep and solvent resistances). Specifically, a universal strategy is proposed to introduce plasticity, reprocessability and recyclability to various polymer networks and composites through a new silyl ether metathesis reaction. First, the general applicability of silyl ether metathesis will be investigated for vitrimers made of common commodity polymers (Aim 1). Aim 2 details plans for the synthesis of vitrimers from multiple polymers through dynamic reactive blending. This provides a simple way to tailor and improve vitrimer properties. The dynamic mechanical properties of the resulting vitrimers will be carefully investigated and correlated with the structures. Finally, the proposed strategy is extended to the design of inorganic/organic composite vitrimers through silyl ether metathesis between inorganic surfaces and organic polymer matrices (Aim 3). Similarly, structure-property studies will be conducted for the composite vitrimers.  Successful demonstration of the proposed strategy could offer significant impact on new materials development, polymer recycling and sustainability, and modern technologies including additive manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to make the new compounds so that they are suitable for depositing the metals onto heated surfaces so that they can then be used in the construction of new devices. At the current time, none of the known compounds that contain these metals have the properties needed for this effort. The project employs techniques from organic, inorganic, and materials chemistry.

Initial targets are relatives of known Ti(III) and V(III) amidinates, followed by more ambitious targets, including compounds of Ti(II), Zr(III), Hf(III), Nb(II), Nb(III), and Mo(III). The fundamental knowledge gained in the project may help to solve important technological problems, including deposition of smaller interconnects for computers, and making superconducting wires for the long-distance transmission of electricity. Particularly important targets are Ti(II) compounds, for which no examples are known with the desired combination of properties: volatility, thermal stability, and high reactivity. The chosen ligands combine steric and electronic properties expected to stabilize highly reactive Ti(II) compounds. Similar strategies are being explored for Zr, Hf, V, Nb and Mo, for which only a few compounds even come close to combining all of these desired properties.

Over last 20 year important connections with string theory were discovered as well. Algebraic Geometry is the study of algebraic varieties: geometric objects that can be described as the collections of points satisfying a set of polynomial equations. One of the aims of the field is to classify algebraic varieties. This can be done by first associating discrete invariants to algebraic varieties and then studying all algebraic varieties with a given set of invariants. A basic invariant used in algebraic geometry, as well as in differential geometry, is the first Chern class. Algebraic varieties can be divided into classes according to the positivity properties (or lack thereof) of this invariant. One of the most important of these classes is that of varieties with first Chern class equal to zero. These varieties have a crucial role also in physics and in differential geometry.

The study of these electrochemical reactions is challenging, however. Catalytic reactions for example can involve the transfer of multiple electrons, and reaction efficiency can be highly dependent on the local arrangement of metal atoms near the molecular adsorbate. Traditional electrochemistry techniques sample the entire metal electrode, which can contain a vast number of nanoscale metallic features, making it difficult to draw clear connections between the local metal structure and the chemical activity.  In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Mirkin of the City University of New York, Queens College is advancing nanoelectrochemical methods and using them to study catalytic reactions taking place on the surfaces of metallic nanoparticles and nanorods.  Unlike traditional electrochemistry techniques, the scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) method used by Professor Mirkin and his students can monitor a region of the surface that is only 10 nm across, or about the equivalent of 30 gold atoms.  This high spatial resolution enables the team to characterize not just individual particles, but different sections of the same particle.  Their results could have broad implications for fields ranging from the development of ultrasensitive detectors, to catalysis for energy conversion and storage.  The project is also providing training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, who are getting multidisciplinary research experience in interfacial electrochemistry, bioanalytical chemistry and nanoscience.<br/><br/>Nanoelectrochemical techniques, such as steady-state voltammetry, SECM, and nanoparticle collisions, are combined with high-resolution tunneling electron microscopy and finite-element simulations to study the fundamental processes that impact the detection of electrochemical events on nanometer length scales. The project is investigating electrochemical processes in microscopic carbon cavities, long-distance transfer of electrons between metal nanoparticles and electrodes, and spatial variations in surface reactivity around catalytically active metallic nanorods.  The interactions between single nanoparticles and nanoelectrodes are investigated by two approaches. In the first, the SECM nanotip is brought to within the tunneling distance of a single nanoparticle, and the tunneling current is detected, while the second approach monitors electron tunneling as nanoparticles collide with the electrode.  The main objective is to develop the experimental and theoretical framework for mechanistic studies and visualization of complex nanoelectrochemical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New layered oxysulfide and chalcogenide nanosheets are synthesized in order to explore the interactions of chalcophilic elements with their surfaces. Another aspect of the project is to develop selective surface chemistry for nanosheets derived from van der Waals solids, based on preliminary results obtained with coordinatively unsaturated organometallic complexes. Research on this project is integrated with mentoring and outreach activities that benefit students at the K-12 and undergraduate levels and that provide summer research experiences for high school teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The many applications of these interactions continue to revolutionize society through advances in medicine, communications, technology, and entertainment. Controlling the fundamental way in which matter interacts with light represents a major priority for many phenomena of great importance for society. This grand challenge is yet to be fully conquered despite the efforts of many chemists and physicists. With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Carlos E. Crespo-Hernndez of Case Western Reserve University to investigate whether strategic structural modification of the DNA component pyrimidine can be used to rationally control the dissipation of energy, processes critical to DNA photochemistry and photostability. Prof. Crespo-Hernndez and his research students use a combination of experiment and theory to examine this innovative idea. The transformative potential of this research is the development of molecular design principles for the control of light-induced pathways in biological and other organic molecules in general. Prof. Crespo-Hernndez seeks to motivate students to enter and persist in scientific studies and careers by providing research opportunities to high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and by mentoring and serving as a role model. The interests of these students are heightened by opportunities for cross- and multidisciplinary research and training in important areas of modern photochemistry and photobiology, time-resolved techniques, and computational methods, and by exposure to national and international collaborations. Research opportunities are provided for economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students from the Greater Cleveland area.<br/><br/>In this research, Professor Crespo-Hernndez is investigating whether selective functionalization of the pyrimidine chromophore can be used to rationally control the radiative and nonradiative decay pathways that are critical to nucleic acid photochemistry. Prof. Crespo-Hernndez and his research students examine this innovative idea by gathering experimental and theoretical data using femto-to-microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy and multiconfigurational calculations.  The objectives include: 1) unravel the electronic relaxation pathways in rationally selected nucleic acid derivatives; 2) map the topology of the potential energy surfaces; and 3) establish structure-dynamics relationships to reveal how functionalization regulates radiative and nonradiative decay pathways. Close collaboration with the theoretical group of Professor Ins Corral of the Universidad Autnoma de Madrid, Spain enhance the impact and increase fundamental understanding of the transformative science proposed. Understanding how functionalization of the pyrimidine chromophore regulates the electronic relaxation pathways in nucleic acid derivatives can assist in the development of therapeutic drugs, crosslinking agents, and fluorescent biomarkers, and may hold the key for understanding why the genetic alphabet is composed of only four nucleobases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are many types of heart disease, but all of them affect the mechanical performance of the heart in some way -- resulting in a heart that struggles to adequately pump blood to itself and/or the rest of the body.  Many devices are being developed to address the mechanical affects of heart disease, but proving that they can work safely and effectively before they are implanted in patients can be a challenge.  In addition, cardiovascular surgeons would like to be able to identify the best implant for a particular patient based on his or her anatomy and disease-effects.  High-quality engineering models offer a potential solution for addressing these challenges.  However, there are significant gaps in the currently available technology for modeling of cardiovascular disease. Despite significant advances in computational and laboratory simulation models, the ability to take advantage of these advances in a unified framework is still beyond reach. This project will help pioneer a new generation of cardiovascular biomechanics models capable of bridging computational and experimental approaches. The research objective is to implement and validate a complete, hybrid framework that integrates experimental (simulation) mechanics with computational physiology. This new framework will selectively harness the strengths while bypassing the limitations of the individual modeling approaches used. This advance will transform current medical device development and treatment planning methods, serving to reduce the amount of animal and human testing necessary, improve clinical decision support, reduce development costs, and expedite the availability of medical products to patients. The educational objectives based on this research include a pipeline of related programs spanning K-12 through graduate school, providing enhancements at every level, with a particular emphasis on increasing the inclusion of minority students. These educational enhancements will enrich STEM education and train the next generation of multidisciplinary engineers to tackle the most pressing medical needs of the aging US population (cardiovascular health), establishing a sustainable pipeline for continued training of young minds in biomedical STEM education.<br/><br/><br/>This project will combine a realistic, computational physiology model with fluid dynamic simulations that will capture the autoregulation response of the heart and allow the integration of actual medical devices within the hybrid system.  By developing a hardware-in-the-loop system that combines computational and in vitro modeling, called a Physiology Modeling Coupled Experiment (PMCE), the project will advance cardiovascular modeling as a whole.  The first aim is to develop robust coupling methods to interface the computational and experimental domains, including: multiple experimental-computational interfaces; discontinuous flow and pressure waveforms; and simulations that include compliant elements.  The second aim is to develop a generalized computational physiology model that accounts for autoregulation, and will therefore produce realistic hemodynamics that can be related to patient characteristics such as body size, body mass index, age, fitness, and metabolic state.  The third aim will be to validate the hybrid model using clinical data that describes real world hemodynamics with various implants, including left ventricular assist devices, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and Fontan cardiopulmonary assist systems.  The integrated educational activities will transition from public outreach at the K-12 level, including STEAM exhibits at the Artisphere Festival in Greenville, SC, through programs focused on transitioning to college, to undergraduate research, and transitioning to graduate school. All educational activities have established objectives, and the PI will assess the effectiveness of these activities so that changes can be made if appropriate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The New York Hall of Science, which serves a large and diverse audience, is an ideal setting for testing the promise of this strategy. Youth educators and curators of public programs at the Hall of Science will mentor two groups of high school- and early college-aged youth, who will contribute to the design and facilitation of engineering-focused events and activities for museum visitors. They will work together to develop engineering programming for the public that emphasizes the cultural and interpersonal dimensions of engineering practices. This group of young people will be recruited from the Hall of Science's more than 100 Explainers, a very diverse group of young people who work part-time at the Hall of Science and engage with visitors as they explore the museum. Researchers will track participants' experiences and document their impact on museum visitors' perceptions of engineering. The expectation is that creating and delivering these experiences for visitors will have a positive impact on the youth participants' understanding of the engineering disciplines, and on visitors' perceptions of engineering and its relationship to everyday life.<br/><br/>The project will use observations, interviews, journaling and the Engineering Professional Skills Assessment to explore youth experience, and visitor exit surveys and interviews to probe visitor perceptions. Both the skills assessment and visitor surveys are NSF-funded instruments. Data coding will be grounded in the engineering habits of mind defined by the National Research Council's Committee on Understanding and Improving K-12 Engineering Education in the United States (2009). The project will capture evidence regarding which habits of mind the Fellows are most frequently engaged with. The effort will also explore how interactions with peers (as colleagues), with experts (as learners, such as with Designers in Residence) and with visitors (as teachers and leaders) may be associated with different combinations of the habits of mind over the course of the project. Visitor data and assessment data will allow the project to begin to make analytic connections between participating young people's increased understanding of culturally-situated engineering challenges, and their impact on the experiences of museum visitors who engage with engineering programming at the Hall of Science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work focuses on a new class of metals - Weyl semimetals - that have massless electrons similar to those in graphene but that are free to move in three dimensions. By applying extremely large magnetic fields this project seeks to force the Weyl electrons to interact with one another and form new states of matter. There is a large gap in our understanding of what happens to three dimensional metals in extreme magnetic fields, and this project fills that gap. The plan includes measurements under these extreme conditions, pushing the frontier for techniques such as ultrasound spectroscopy up to 100 tesla and eventually beyond. This broadens the range of parameters where discoveries can be made by all researchers investigating new materials. A resonant ultrasound spectroscopy lab module will be developed, bringing this modern experimental technique to the classroom. This module will be made available through the American Association of Physics Teachers Advanced Lab website, and the undergraduate will have the opportunity to present their work at the ""Beyond First Year Labs"" conference. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>The quantum limit is the magnetic field beyond which all electrons in a metal are confined to the last Landau level. This state is highly degenerate and prone to the formation of density waves, excitonic phases, and possibly Wigner crystals. While the quantum limit has been studied extensively in gate-tunable two dimensional systems such as GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures and graphene, very little is known about 3D metals in the quantum limit, and even less is known about 3D Dirac and Weyl semimetals in this limit. This project studies how Weyl fermions behave when magnetic fields provide the dominant energy scale in the system. Questions include: do Weyl fermions survive when the cyclotron and Zeeman energies are larger than the spin-orbit coupling; are Weyl fermions unstable to the formation of a new state of matter in high magnetic fields; and does the Weyl topology of the electronic structure play an important role in magnetic-field induced correlated states? This project develops experimental tools aligned along two complementary directions of ultrasound and electrical transport to answer these questions. This includes quantitative resistivity measurements using focused-ion-beam lithography for investigating phenomena such as the chiral anomaly. These transport measurements (including Hall effect) are used to develop a realistic tight-binding model for TaAs in the quantum limit, enabling theoretical calculations of possible high-field correlated states. The principle investigator's previous work on TaAs suggests the formation of a correlated electronic phase above 80 tesla. This project develops frequency-dependent pulse echo ultrasound, covering frequencies from the low MHz up to a few GHz, to probe quasiparticle dynamics near the field-induced phase transition, and to uncover which (if any) symmetry is broken at the transition. The synthesis of these two approaches will yield both a quantitative picture of how the electronic structure of a Weyl semimetal evolves with field into the quantum limit, and how that electronic structure becomes unstable to interactions and ultimately leads to a new field-induced state of matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, nanoscale control of materials is essential to enable further decreases in the feature sizes and growth of materials in three dimensional architectures that are being developed for applications such as logic circuitry, memories, and photovoltaics. This research investigates the fundamental rearrangement of single atomic layers on surfaces during thin film growth, and provides important knowledge regarding the factors that influence transformation of disordered layers of atoms into ordered, crystalline arrangements. The primary experimental platform utilizes an electron beam to probe the structure of atomically-thick layers during growth and thermal processing. The research also uses atomically-resolved electron microscopy to probe the structure of these films. The knowledge generated from this research allows for an enhanced control and understanding of the formation of nanoscale crystalline materials that can be created on three dimensional (non-planar) surfaces and impacts a wide variety of fields in nanoelectronics, computing, photovoltaics, and nanoscale mechanical systems. This research activity is integrated with a university thin film course, a hands-on equipment laboratory, and an industrial outreach effort. Graduates typically find employment in national laboratory or industry.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research elucidates the fundamental transformations that occur during atomic layer deposition and annealing by utilizing in situ reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Current atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes are often limited in terms of the structural control that is available due to precursor decomposition at high temperatures, which presents a significant barrier to precisely controlled three dimensional epitaxial architectures that are integral to next generation electronics. Therefore, this work separates the precursor chemisorption steps (ALD component) that result in amorphous layers from thermal processing that provides energy needed to induce crystallization in the model material system gallium oxide. Importantly, electron diffraction is probing in real time the structural transformations that occur to reveal the effect of ambient atmosphere, substrate structure, and orientation with adlayer thicknesses in the range of 0.5-10 nm. Analytical electron microscopy is providing precise structural and compositional details of the films and film-substrate interfaces including defect characteristics. This research captures a slow-motion picture of the structural changes that occur during many traditional thin film epitaxy techniques, and yields new relationships that control crystallization of ultra-thin layers and thus impacts the thin film/epitaxy communities. Undergraduate and graduate students are trained during the research. Industrial engagements are pursued with the Lehigh University Office of Economic Engagement.

A set of socioeconomic, urbanization, and climate change scenarios will be designed to explore challenges of growing water demand under urbanization and climate change. The modeling platform is designed to be transferrable to watersheds across the world - especially those facing the challenges of fast urbanization and potential climate change - for a systematic and integrative evaluation of the food-energy-water system to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies for water sustainability.<br/><br/>A modeling platform integrating three key components will be built to allow an improved understanding of water demand and sustainability under urbanization and climate change. The first component is an urban growth model, supported by satellite remote sensing and socioeconomic data, to project future urbanization and predict the consequent urban heat island intensity. The second component is a multi-sector water demand model to evaluate the impact of urbanization and climate change on water demand from public supply, and electricity use and resulting thermoelectric cooling water demand. The third component will examine the impact of urbanization on runoff and crop land loss, along with resulting complex changes in crop yields and irrigation water demand. This integrated modeling platform will serve as a prototype in coupling often independent research areas (e.g., urbanization, energy, and water) together with scenario analyses to explore complex problems and create a means to address growing water demand challenges under urbanization and climate change. This project will offer the opportunity for stakeholders to participate in the dialogue. The plan is to develop an interactive training program for land use planners and water managers with specific outreach to planning agencies that will encourage people to engage in the training.

This proposal builds upon theories of risk communication, emotional intelligence, and self-determination to design new approaches to cybersecurity risk communication and training. The goals are to enable users to assess risks, costs, and benefits consistently and correctly, to promote task-focused coping responses, and to facilitate their internalization of values, promoting spontaneous diffusion of cybersecurity knowledge. By enabling non-expert users to make informed security decisions through raising cybersecurity risk awareness and self-efficacy development, this project directly addresses an increasingly serious threat to economic growth and national security. This project also creates cybersecurity research and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and members from the underrepresented groups through outreach initiatives.<br/><br/>This project systematically tests two hypotheses: (i) that addressing gaps in mental models along with development of self-efficacy can promote task-focused coping responses and early conformance behavior, and (ii) that communicating social motives can lead to the development of intrinsic motivation and spontaneous diffusion of information. Towards that end, the researchers design and conduct a series of interview-style user studies including both expert and non-expert users, and they develop effective risk communication modules that address gaps in mental models and enable non-expert users to evaluate risks, costs and benefits of security decisions. This project will also test the efficacy of different interventions  to promote task-focused coping responses and promote spontaneous diffusion of information. By systematically testing the aforementioned hypotheses, this project provides in-depth understanding regarding the influence of emotions and social motives in cybersecurity behavior and makes a valuable contribution to the theoretical foundation of risk communication. By investigating mental models of high school students as well as adults, this project advances the theory of risk communication for adolescents in the cybersecurity context and enables cybersecurity professionals to design risk communication modules specifically targeting this vulnerable demographic.

He is developing new methods for the preparation of novel chemical compounds that have the potential to serve as lead compounds for pharmaceutical development.  His unique approach exploits the unusual chemical properties that arise when an aromatic ring is complexed to a metal. These unusual chemical properties lead to new chemical reactions that convert the originally flat aromatic ring into a significantly more complex molecule. The presence of the metal allows for introduction of the complexity in a controlled fashion. The invention of the new methods allows for completely new approaches to the synthesis of a variety of interesting and potentially useful molecules. While not part of this proposal. The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, and medicinal chemistry. Students work in a fully interdisciplinary research environment on a wide range of problems and become integrated into the scientific community through attendance and presentations at professional meetings, participation in writing peer-reviewed manuscripts, participating in the proposal-writing process, and meeting other scientists.  Thus, it is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Harman's group is also well positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.  Outreach activities involving K-12 students will also be part of the funded project.  Finally, collaborations with professors from undergraduate institutions allow these professors greater exposure to current research methods, and expose their students to major research programs. <br/><br/>The goal of this work is the development of new methods for the syntheses of novel molecular substances from aromatic molecules. This is being accomplished by leveraging the unique chemical properties of an aromatic molecule that result from its dihapto-coordination to a transition metal. Such action modifies the chemical reactivity of the aromatic substrate, allowing its elaboration into novel organic compounds. Significantly, these dearomatization reactions are leading to new molecules with considerable stereochemical complexity that are well suited for biological evaluation. Previously, heavy metal dearomatization agents derived from osmium, rhenium, and tungsten have been investigated, exploiting their powerful pi-donating abilities. In this work, the PI is exploring the feasibility and practicality of a dihapto-coordinate dearomatization methodology based on a second-row metal. Fundamental chemical features of molybdenum-based aromatic complexes are being investigated and compared to the analogous heavy metal systems. Differences in bond energies, oxidation state stabilities, pi-interactions, tolerance of chemical reagents, cost, and recyclability are ultimately leading to new synthetic opportunities that complement those provided by the heavy metal based systems.  The molecular frameworks that are formed through these studies are providing novel architectures that ultimately will be valuable in the development of new biologically active materials. In many cases there are simply no other means for easily obtaining these compounds. Other broader impacts of this work are related to the professional training of graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of Organic, Inorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry.

This insight was further developed, first notably in algebraic geometry, later progressing to geometry and topology. For a classical geometric space, the multiplication of its coordinates is commutative, namely, the multiplication does not depend on the order of operation.  However, there are many natural ""geometric objects"" in both mathematics and physics, especially quantum mechanics, where the coordinates no longer commute. Noncommutative geometry is a branch of mathematics that is designed to handle just such noncommutative ""geometric objects"". Invariants of differential equations and more generally K-theory of operator algebras are a central part of noncommutative geometry. The principal investigator intends to study a certain class of invariants of differential equations and apply them to study problems in geometry and topology.<br/><br/>A long term research goal of the principal investigator is to use methods from K-theory of operator algebras and more generally noncommutative geometry to study higher index theoretic invariants of elliptic operators and their applications to geometry and topology.

This project aims to answer core questions of the Langlands program revolving around the so-called functoriality conjecture, in a generalized setting known as the relative Langlands program. <br/> <br/>The relative Langlands program replaces reductive groups by more general homogeneous spaces, aiming to understand their local and automorphic spectra. A basic tool is the relative trace formula, a generalization of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula, which has still not been fully developed. The project aims to establish new types of comparisons between relative trace formulas that would simultaneously address the questions of relative functoriality, and of conjectural relations between periods of automorphic forms and L-functions. The two main goals of the project are: (1) the development of the technical basis for such comparisons, including a general relative trace formula, and (2) the development of a local-to-global strategy for the comparison of trace formulas, as in endoscopy, but with scalar transfer factors replaced by more general transfer operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its main goal is to better understand how to build and sustain the capacity of elementary science teachers in grades 3-5 to instruct and formatively assess students in ways that are aligned with contemporary science education frameworks and standards. To achieve this goal, the project will use classroom-based science assessment as a focus around which to build teacher capacity in science instruction and three-dimensional learning in science. The three dimensions will include disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. These dimensions are described in the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council; NRC, 2012), and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States, 2013). The project will work closely with teachers to co-develop usable assessments and rubrics and help them to learn about three-dimensional assessment and instruction. Also, the project will work with teachers to test the developed assessments in diverse settings, and to create an active, online community of practice. <br/><br/>The two research questions will be: (1) How well do these assessments function with respect to aspects of validity for classroom use, particularly in terms of indicators of student proficiency, and tools to support teacher instructional practice?; and (2) In what ways do providing these assessment tasks and rubrics, and supporting teachers in their use, advance teachers' formative assessment practices to support multi-dimensional science instruction? The research and development components of this project will produce assessments and rubrics, which can directly impact students and teachers in the districts and states that have adopted the NGSS, as well as those that have embraced the vision of science teaching and learning embodied in the NRC Framework. The project will consist of five major tasks. First, the effort will iteratively develop assessments and rubrics for formative use, using an evidence-centered design approach. Second, it will collect data from evidence-based revision and redesign of the assessments from teachers piloting the assessments and rubrics, project cognitive laboratory studies with students, and an external review of the assessments design products. Third, it will study teachers' classroom use of assessments to understand and document how they blend assessment and instruction. The project will use pre/post questionnaires, video recordings, observation field notes, and pre/post interviews. Fourth, the study will build the capacity of participating teachers. Teacher Collaborators (n=9) will engage in participatory design of the assessment tasks and act as technical assistants to the overall implementation process. Teacher Implementers (n=15) will use the assessments formatively as part of their instructional practice. Finally, the work will develop a community of learners through the development of a technical assistance infrastructure, and leveraging teacher expertise to formatively assess students' work, using the assessments designed to be diagnostic and instructionally informative. External reviewers and an advisory board will provide formative feedback on the project's processes and summative evaluation of the project's results. The main outcomes of this endeavor will be prototypes of elementary science multi-dimensional assessments and new knowledge for the field on the underlying theory for developing teachers' capacity for engaging in multi-dimensional science instruction, learning, and assessment.<br/><br/>The DRK-12 Program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These applications are based on materials containing specific elements called 3d transition metals. However, many more types of magnetic phases are predicted to exist and proposed for applications. One exotic example is the quantum spin liquid, where the spins directions are never aligned and always fluctuating, even down to the lowest possible temperature. This could be exploited to make a quantum computer. Another example is the magnetic multipolar phase, where the atomic magnets have a more complex multipole structure than just a simple arrow, that could be used for ultrahigh-speed electronics. This work focuses on a class of oxides, and will lead to unconventional magnetic phases and ways to control them for future applications. The PI collaborates with the University of Michigan Museum of History to perform K-12 education outreach, such as developing table-top demonstrations, setting up research stations, and participating in science communication programs, and she mentors undergraduate and graduate students with twin aims of encouraging broad participation in research and preparing the next generation of scientists.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>This project is directed at novel magnetic phases in a new class of materials, 5d transition metal oxides, where electron correlations and spin orbit coupling coexist at comparable energy scales. Specifically, the project consists of three closely related research efforts: (1) developing and utilizing a set of symmetry sensitive optical techniques, magneto-optical Kerr effect, nonlinear optical spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, to probe both ground states and excitation of the magnetic phases in spin orbit coupled correlated electron materials; (2) investigating the evolution of these magnetic phases under static controls such as chemical substitution and DC magnetic field, in order to drive quantum phase transitions; (3) exploring dynamic control over these magnetic phases using electromagnetic radiation from modern femtosecond pulsed lasers, and realize thermally inaccessible hidden phases. The discovery of novel magnetic phases in this new interaction regime sheds light on the understanding of physics that has in common strong electron correlations and strong spin orbit coupling, and the successful control over these new magnetic phases guides rational design of new materials for realizing long sought-after quantum phases and novel devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Alabugin is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Florida State University.  He is developing new ways to prepare precisely shaped and functionalized structures of graphene (a flat sheet containing only carbon atom). The goal of the project is to provide the missing synthetic tools needed to construct new molecules with interesting optoelectronic properties. To do this, the high energy and unique, tunable reactivity of carbon-rich precursors for will be used to develop strategies that build the shaped graphene structures from smaller pieces. Key to this effort are cascade reactions that form multiple bonds and unite multiple cyclic unites in a single operation. By splicing together the smaller structure in a controlled fashion, the shape of the larger object can be controlled more precisely. The results will be disseminated in the PI's publications and outreach activities, including participation in public lectures, scientific symposia, giving talks at industrial, undergraduate, and graduate institutions, as well as recording educational videos at the GEOSET studio at Florida State University.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research is in leveraging electronic factors that control alkyne cyclizations for the development of efficient routes to conjugated carbon nanostructures with predesigned shape and functionality. In this approach, oilgoalkyne chains of varying sizes, equipped with different substituents, are built in a modular fashion and then ""zipped"" up via a cascade of fast and efficient radical cyclizations. Selectivity of initial radical attack on the multifunctional substrates is controlled by the presence of a ""traceless directing group"" that is removed in the course of the one-pot process. By the choice of the relay functional groups and the terminal pi-system, the final step of the cascade can be controlled, so that either a five- or a six-membered rings is formed. In particular, this work is developing a suite of peri-cyclizations based on a combination of traceless directing groups, cyclization at the ""zigzag edge"" of acene subunits, and fragmentations. This approach opens access to unusual aromatics and conjugated persistent radicals.  The broader impact include the applications of the new carbon-rich conjugated molecules as components in the design of optoelectronic materials, energy storage devices, sensors, transistors, solar cells, polymer composites etc. The educational plan includes providing advanced research training to students of different backgrounds, including students from the Florida historically black universities.

While these tools were initially intended for certain problems about differential equations, they have also led to important breakthroughs in number theory. More precisely, Diophantine equations are potentially complicated systems of equations involving whole numbers, and mathematicians are interested in counting the number of solutions to such systems. Unlike waves, numbers do not oscillate, at least not in an obvious manner, but one can think of numbers as frequencies, and thus associate them to waves. In this way, problems related to counting the number of solutions to Diophantine systems can be rephrased in the language of quantifying wave interferences. This project will further extend the scope of decouplings towards the resolution of fundamental problems in harmonic analysis and number theory. The project will make new tools accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community.<br/><br/>Decouplings have proved remarkably flexible in addressing a wide variety of problems in such diverse fields as number theory, partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. One important circle of questions that remain to be addressed concerns the decoupling inequalities for curves on small spatial balls. Also, the cone poses a lot of interesting problems, even in three dimensions. The square function estimate, the local smoothing conjecture and, the decoupling into small caps are just a few examples of related problems for the cone. Progress on these problems is likely to lead to progress on many other problems. Finally, the combination of decouplings and the polynomial method has recently led to significant progress in the restriction theory of curved manifolds.

It will examine how these narratives differ from the ways in which scientists and engineers understand and explain their work related to disability. Currently, stories about technologies for disability feature accounts of life-changing technology and techno-optimism, which differs substantially from the stories disabled people tell about the technologies they choose to use. The researcher also plans to implement educational and outreach activities aimed at the inclusion of people with disabilities in conversations about technology, and about engineering and design spaces as collaborators and future practitioners. She will also develop classroom, public, and open-access materials that include narrative accounts from disabled people about technologies that appropriately bear witness to ambiguity and resistance to technological configurations; it is expected that these materials would be used to complement existing STEM educational materials.<br/><br/>This project highlights the disconnects between STEM practice concerning disability and the lived experience of disability. By looking at the history, narratives, and context of negotiations about technology, this work centers the expertise possessed by disabled communities about the nature of disability, offering alternative narratives for considering disabled bodies in the technological imagination - and bodies in technology, more generally. This CAREER plan seeks to bridge what we know about bodies and biases from STS and philosophy of technology with first-person observation and historical context from the field of disability studies.

The first application is related to the classification of algebraic objects when the objects are determined up to isomorphism by their cohomological invariants. The second application considered in the project is the rationality problem for classifying spaces of algebraic groups.

This project aims to address the national shortage of culturally-competent secondary teachers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). STEMTeach will use a combination of high-quality teaching approaches and student support to improve the quality of STEM secondary education available in Northwest Georgia. It aims to overcome two common obstacles for dual degree teacher certification programs. The primary challenge is that students rarely regard teaching as a ""first-choice"" career in STEM. The secondary challenge is the course and practicum requirements of completing two degrees. Some STEM majors do not consider teaching before their junior or even senior year. This late decision-making increases the time and, therefore, the expense to complete college, which students with financial need often cannot afford. The project will graduate 25 highly qualified Noyce scholars to teach in high-need rural and urban schools. Additionally, the project will strengthen Berry's STEM education program. The centerpiece of these efforts will be the expansion and further development of outreach and early awareness experiences, apprenticeships with master teachers, mentoring, and early field experiences. As a result of this project, Berry College will develop three new STEM-focused education courses. In addition, it will create activities and supports specifically for these STEM dual majors following their graduation. Through Noyce support, Berry College will increase its production of new STEM teachers by 50% annually. It will also recruit students into the teaching profession from a wider variety of STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>STEMTeach at Berry College will support a total of 25 Noyce undergraduate scholars majoring in physics, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, or mathematics.

Berry will collaborate with high-need school districts in rural Floyd County Schools and urban Rome City Schools. The program will evaluate and share its Noyce project findings among stakeholders in Georgia, at national conferences, and via submissions to peer-reviewed journals. The research will focus on the specific impacts of the apprenticeship model, including its effect on STEM students' decision to pursue teaching, their retention in a certification program, and teacher selection of school placement and in-service retention.

Like most funding agencies, NIH uses peer review to evaluate the merit of grant applications. Approximately three reviewers from a given review group (called a ""study section"") assign preliminary impact scores and write critiques to evaluate each application before attending study section meetings where all members contribute to a final priority score. Although NIH's review process is considered one of the best in the world, reports and self-studies show that racial/ethnic minorities and women have lower award rates for first time, and renewal applications, respectively, for NIH's largest funding mechanism, the R01 grant. This is problematic because R01s are critical for career advancement, and research conducted by racial/ethnic minorities and women is linked to technological innovation and is known to address costly education, economic, and health disparities. As a leader in efforts to diversify the science and medical workforce, NIH has called for studies to test for the possibility that bias may operate in its peer review process. This call brings to light the broad need for research on the effectiveness of peer review, which is used across all science and technology fields, and for more scientists to engage in such research. If factors unrelated to the quality of the proposed science negatively impact the outcome of a grant review, it runs counter to funding agencies' goals to select the best science, blocks expensive downstream federal efforts to broaden participation in science, and undermines the competitiveness of the U.S. scientific enterprise.<br/><br/>Our group was the first to show that, when combined with traditional analyses of scores and award rates, linguistic analysis of NIH peer reviewers' narrative critiques of R01 applications can show evidence of potential stereotype-based bias in reviewers' decision making. Although such bias is generally unintentional and impacts reviewers' judgment regardless of their own sex or race, it can lead reviewers to differentially enforce evaluation criteria. Controlled experiments show, for instance, that cultural stereotypes that racial/ethnic minorities and women lack intrinsic ability for fields like science, can lead reviewers to unconsciously require more proof to confirm their competence. Over the past decade machine learning technologies have made data-, text-, and video-mining into state-of-the-art analytic techniques, which, if applied to scientific peer review, could revolutionize the field. Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) neural networks -- algorithms that function like the human brain to identify complex patterns in data -- in particular, have catapulted the application of computer science to the study of social and psychological phenomena. Using a large, demographically diverse set of NIH R01 application critiques, scores, and video of constructed study section discussions, this project is producing analytical tools that use LSTMs to capture evidence of stereotype-based bias in both written and oral discussion of grant applications.

Students who graduate with credentials in UAS technologies should be able to enter a high-growth STEM industry that is expected to need many workers in the next decade. <br/><br/>The central goal of the project is to develop UAS curricula at Parkland College that meet industry needs in the major agricultural hub of Central Illinois and its surrounding area, which is expanding the use of UAS technologies. The newly-developed courses will be based on existing courses from partnering community colleges but with an emphasis on UAS applications for agricultural industries. Topics covered in the courses will include flight controllers, aerodynamics, managing data, regulations, and safety and operational considerations. The courses will be combined to create 6-credit and 18-credit UAS certificates. Industry input about curricular content will be integrated into designing the credentials so that the credentials appropriately prepare technicians for jobs in the UAS sector. The project team also aims to develop articulation agreements with universities offering UAS degrees. These connections will ensure that the new curriculum will be transferable for students wishing to continue their education. Project outreach activities will focus on recruiting women and veterans into the program, and foster associations with regional high schools. The products and best practices from the project will be disseminated through coordination with community college and university partners as well as online at multiple NSF-ATE Centers, including the National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this end, this project plans to develop a curriculum for a new academic program that will prepare students to work as technicians in operation, maintenance, and repair of small UAS. Through site visits and a national steering committee, the project will work with employers to identify current and future needs for technicians.  It will use this information to create an associate degree program that aligns with the expectations of employers, manufacturers, and regulatory agencies. This new curriculum could benefit employers involved directly in the UAS industry, as well as employers in other fields such as agriculture, insurance, real estate, utilities, construction, media, and law enforcement/public safety. Project results will be shared with other community and technical colleges interested in training UAS technicians, with a special focus on building capacity for colleges that wish to develop an aviation technician program or to enhance current offerings. The project will promote diversity in the technical workforce by training all students in entrepreneurial principles and skills, and by supporting enrollment and retention of female students. The project aims to create a pool of trained technicians available for work in southern New Jersey, a region in which policymakers and government agencies are encouraging development of a robust UAS industry.<br/><br/>The project will define the skills and knowledge needed to enable a technician to maintain, upgrade, or repair a small UAS, and develop an innovative academic program that promotes the requisite student learning. Curriculum development will use a systematic approach to instructional design, based on the Dick and Carey model instructional model.  This approach includes defining the needs, the audience, the tasks that students will need to master, as well as planning for student assessment and course/program evaluation. The curriculum will include education and training in aviation regulation, aviation weather, aeronautical knowledge, mechanical/electronic engineering, geospatial data collection, and computer science. The curriculum will also include three competency areas that researchers have identified for UAS technicians: hardware, software, and documentation and personnel issues. Drone manufacturers and employers will provide input to ensure that the program educates skilled technicians who can comply with FAA regulations for safe operation of small drones in the national airspace system. Industry experts conclude that the largest barrier in building a UAS maintenance knowledge base is lack of maintenance documentation for drones. The project will address this barrier by facilitating greater information-sharing by manufacturers. Project leaders have extensive professional contacts and collaborators in the UAS industry, as well as administrative experience and expertise in engineering curriculum development. The project plans to build on an existing aviation program at the college that can provide resources (e.g., equipment; teaching space; administrative support) and a sustainable source of new equipment and ongoing professional development opportunities for faculty. Other academic institutions, including Rutgers University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith, will provide input on the curriculum and related project activities.  In addition, so that this program can build on existing expertise and experience in UAS technician training, the project leaders will make site visits to other community colleges with active UAS training programs, including Sinclair Community College in Ohio and Northland Community and Technical College in Minnesota.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Amber VanDerwarker, Douglas Kennett, and Heather Thakar will undertake research to study early plant domestication and the transition from foraging to food production over the last 12,000 years in Central America. Previous scholarship has focused almost exclusively on maize domestication because of its importance for the development of complex political institutions throughout Mesoamerica. This project expands this narrow focus on maize to include the broader forest and field agricultural regimes. Given that most of the world's population today is supported by agriculture, there is enormous value in reconstructing the breadth of ancient cropping practices along with the economic and societal resilience it affords. Ancient analogs that integrate field cultivation and arboriculture provide alternatives to modern mono-cropping in ways that can conserve soil fertility and promote cultigen diversity. Archaeology is well situated to inform modern farming practices through the documentation of ancient agricultural practices worldwide and the reconstruction of cropping strategies practiced through time in particular regional contexts. In regions such as Mesoamerica, which represents one of the few primary centers of plant domestication, the nature and timeline of the establishment and augmentation of agricultural and arboricultural systems is of great significance.<br/><br/>Drs. VanDerwarker, Kennett, and Thakar will examine both the (1) adoption, spread, and intensification of field cultigens within an evolving regional food economy, and (2) the extent of forest management and change in tree cropping systems. The research team will accomplish these goals through the analysis of well-preserved plant remains from El Gigante Rockshelter in Honduras, which was occupied intermittently for 11,000 years. The research team is composed of archaeologists specializing in archaeobotany, archaeometry, and Mesoamerican prehistory, and will employ an integrated analysis of plant identification, metric analysis, and direct radiocarbon dating. This combined approach will allow the team to not only document the timing and use of new domesticates, but will also facilitate the reconstruction of field clearance and woodland management practices that shaped modern forest communities in this region. The team will thus generate new data and interpretations for long-term human-landscape adaptations while creating educational and training opportunities for students and local Honduran stakeholder communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classical approaches using the theory of L-functions and sieve theory have achieved great results in this direction, and it is expected that by incorporating tools from additive combinatorics one can go beyond what the classical methods could achieve. The PI will also continue to investigate the theory of Gowers norms for multiplicative functions and for the von-Mangoldt function.

A large part of the theory of dynamical systems deals with long-term behaviors of typical trajectories in certain mathematical or physical systems, such as hyperbolic systems or Hamiltonian systems. A key task of spectral analysis of the ergodic Schroedinger operators is to study the asymptotic behaviors of the solutions of the associated eigenvalue equations. Bridges between two different areas can then be built since ``asymptotic behaviors of solutions'' may be interpreted as ``long-term behaviors of certain systems''. The goal of this project is to develop dynamical techniques that are driven by building such bridges and that may benefit both areas.<br/><br/>Different disordered media lead to different type of ergodic base systems. The famous and intensively studied Anderson model corresponds to i.i.d. random variables which can be generated by full shift. Two types of base systems with which this project is concerned are quasi-periodic systems, typical almost periodic systems, and hyperbolic systems, classic type of strongly mixing systems. Various levels of randomness may be detected by a dynamical object, the Lyapunov exponent, which is the main object of study of this project. One focus of this project is the study of positivity and large deviation estimates of the Lyapunov exponent. These properties are super sensitive to the randomness of the base dynamics, are generally difficult to obtain, and are thus among central topics in dynamics systems. From the side of spectral theory, they are strong indications of the Anderson Localization phenomenon and imply immediately certain regularity of both the Lyapunov exponent and the integrated density of states. Deep investigation of the two properties for both quasi-periodic and hyperbolic base dynamics may shed light on how to obtain positive Lyapunov exponent of the standard map. This is one of the most notorious unsolved problems in dynamical systems where the difficulty lies exactly in the complicated coexistence of both elliptic and hyperbolic behaviors. Another fundamental relation between dynamical systems and spectral theory is the Cantor Spectrum phenomenon. The most famous physical example regarding this phenomenon is the Hofstadter's butterfly. In dynamical systems, Cantor spectrum phenomenon may be viewed as some kind of ubiquity of uniformly hyperbolic systems.  Another focus of this project is then to investigate Cantor spectrum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this important national issue, Chemeketa Community College in Oregon will collaborate with food and beverage processors and processing equipment manufacturers to develop a new education program for manufacturing systems technicians. The goal is to develop an industry-driven program with stackable certificates embedded in a two-year associate degree, and with clear pathways to employment in high wage fields and/or a baccalaureate degree. As courses are developed, the project will use a work-based learning model that allows employees to engage both in the classroom and on the job.  In this way, employees and employers can immediately benefit from the new skills and knowledge that the employees are learning. This industry-driven project is designed to develop a prototype that could be useful regionally and nationally for addressing technician education in other areas such aerospace and technology manufacturing, both growing manufacturing sectors with large existing companies. <br/><br/>Project activities will include conducting a DACUM (Developing a Curriculum), the occupational analysis process developed by Ohio State University that is used extensively in developing two-year college workforce programs. Based on the DACUM results, programs and courses in current associate degree technician programs at the institution will be reorganized and modified to fit the needs of the cross-sector group of industry partners.  As needed, new courses will be created to meet industry-specific requirements. For example, industry partners have indicated that they increasingly use automated processes and robots to improve quality of products and reduce costs. To accommodate these changes in manufacturing processes, this project will research, develop, and disseminate curriculum to prepare workers with the skills and knowledge to set up, operate, test, and maintain these machines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the fundamental goals of number theory is to understand solution sets of polynomial equations.  These equations define geometric objects, for example, the algebraic curves on which many modern cryptographic systems are based.  Instead of focusing on solutions to a single equation, one can consider a family of equations and attempt to understand the average behavior, the extremal behavior, and in particularly nice settings, to compute the entire distribution of the number of solutions when varying through this family.  Within families of curves there are certain properties that one might want to avoid, or select for, so it is an important problem to understand how often these properties arise.  In the second half of the twentieth century, mathematicians began to develop the interplay between number theory and the theory of error-correcting codes.  This project will explore this connection, using ideas from coding theory to understand families of algebraic curves.<br/><br/>The questions examined in this research project are a part of the field of arithmetic statistics.  The principal investigator will explore distributions of rational point counts for families of elliptic curves over finite fields, especially families that play a key role in cryptography.

The project will also study the distribution of rational point counts for genus-3 curves over finite fields.  Computational evidence suggests that there are more curves with many rational points than with few points.  The principal investigator aims to use ideas from the theory of error-correcting codes to understand this asymmetry.  A major theme of this project is finding boundaries between counting problems that have polynomial answers, ones where formulas are not polynomial but can be expressed in terms of quantities such as Fourier coefficients of modular forms, and problems where we can only hope for asymptotic answers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here a classification of a collection of complicated objects provides a simpler way to identify and distinguish between objects in the more complicated class. The classification theory for von Neumann algebras is relatively well developed. The classification was obtained by Connes (and others) in the 1970s. While on the C*-algebra side, it was only in the 1990s that one began to see rapid developments in classification theory. Since then, the classification of C*-algebras has blossomed into one of the central areas in the study of C*-algebras, and tremendous progress has been made in the last few years.

Self-assembled from metal ion clusters and organic linkers, crystalline porous materials known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit remarkable synthetic simplicity, structural diversity, and size-selective guest uptake capacity, which make them attractive platforms for a variety of advanced applications. Although their practical applications are well documented, electronic and photonic MOFs are still at their infancy and evolving rapidly. Supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program of the National Science Foundation, this project focuses on developing stimuli-responsive MOFs that not only capture complementary guest molecules inside their cavities, but also engage them in specific electronic interactions to stimulate new properties and functions, particularly, charge conduction and light to electrical energy conversion. Precisely oriented films of electro- and photoactive MOFs grown on functionalized electrodes are integrated into prototype devices to exploit the preorganized porous architectures filled with complementary guests to promote directional charge movement in electrical and photovolatic devices. Systematic structure-property relationship studies demonstrate how stimuli-responsive MOFs adapt to different physical and chemical inputs and how their tunable electronic and optical properties can be exploited. In addition to providing graduate students and postdoctoral researchers a cutting-edge research and learning environment, this interdisciplinary project is enabling the PI to engage undergraduate and high school students in research, motivate younger generation to pursue higher education in science and technology through outreach activities at local schools and science museum, and raise the public awareness on the importance of basic research by discussing scientific breakthroughs in public forums. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The electrical conductivity and photovoltaic activity are among the most coveted but remote properties of metal-organic frameworks. The lack of intrinsic charge carrier density and the light-harvesting capability, however, deprives many existing porous frameworks of tunable electronic and optical properties that are key to their abilities to serve as viable semiconductors and photovoltaic materials. To address these issues and transform MOFs into viable electronic and photonic materials, in this project, the PI and his team are (1) constructing stimuli-responsive MOFs based on redox- and photoactive ligands that can interact with and respond to various guests, applied electric field, and light to create new non-native properties, (2) growing robust, oriented MOF-films in a bottom-up fashion on functionalized electrode surfaces that can promote directional charge movement, and (3) doping these stimuli-responsive MOF films with complementary redox-active guests that can produce mobile charge carriers by interacting with the ligands and facilitate charge dispersion through the frameworks by forming extended -stacks. The current-voltage profiles of MOF films measured before and after guest infiltration and in the presence and absence of light reveal their stimuli-responsive nature and the impact of the encapsulated electroactive guests on their electronic and optical properties. Since guest intercalation is a ubiquitous and non-destructive process, it can be adopted broadly to engineer non-native electrical and photonic behaviors in any adaptive MOFs. The prototype MOF-based solar cells developed in the PI's lab are also used for outreach activities to demonstrate light to electrical energy conversion to K-12 students and motivate them to pursue higher education in science, technology, engineering, and math.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

APbX3 perovskite, where A is either methylammonium or cesium and X is a halide, has displayed the potential to be an efficient and cost-effective photovoltaic material. These perovskites also show promise for photocatalytic organic synthesis due to their simple synthesis, post-reaction processability, composition from earth-abundant elements, exceptional photophysical properties, readily tunable conduction and valence bands, and high catalytic turnover numbers. Although the instability of these perovskites towards moisture hinders their application as photovoltaics, moisture sensitivity is less of a hindrance for chemical catalysis with suitable organic solvents. This project examines the stability of perovskite nanoparticles in various organic solvents and their suitability for several carbon-carbon bond formation reactions. Band edge-tuning of perovskites is used to adjust their excited-state redox potential to optimize photocatalytic organic synthesis.

It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal.  VL/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  More information about the Symposium may be found online at https://vlhcc18.github.io/.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants to the Graduate Consortium, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women.  <br/><br/>Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.  People now swim in a ""sea"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Graduate Consortium, the 16th to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to use tools and techniques in the early stages of problem solving such as problem definition and solution searching.  In particular, what methods, models, diagrams, and tools can people leverage to create mental models of complex socio-technical systems that can be used to make design decisions and for collaboration?  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.  The student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive constructive feedback from the faculty participants as well as from the other students.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  This event will therefore promote discovery and learning, while also building community among young researchers working from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  To get feedback from a broader slice of the VL/HCC community, every student participant will present a poster or demo at the Showpieces event during the main conference. An extended abstract of each student participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Structural defects in semiconductor materials, imperfections where atoms are misplaced in the crystalline material, often limit their performance, and it is desirable to remove such defects. Many of the improvements previously seen relied on a fundamental understanding of the behavior, formation, and removal pathways of different types of imperfections.  In this project, we aim to understand defects in nanocrystals, which are tiny pieces of crystalline solids and are known to behave differently than their bulk counterparts.  Nanocrystals can be thought of as small analogues of individual LEGO bricks, and similarly they can be attached into larger structures that may have properties that are more interesting or useful than the individual building blocks.  Unfortunately, when nanocrystals are attached, they can attach imperfectly which can give rise to the same crystalline defects that limit traditional semiconductors.   This project aims to look at these defects with atomic detail using advanced electron microscopy techniques to understand the defects that form when nanocrystals attach, how those defects can be removed, and how to prevent them from forming in the first place.  By developing a fundamental understanding of defects in nanocrystals, it may be possible to make nanocrystal assemblies with sufficient material quality (lack of defects) to have properties not observed in any natural material. Furthermore, this project exposes a diverse body of undergraduates to high-level scientific research thought a unique undergraduate research program where ~20 first-year undergraduate students work collaboratively to analyze atomically resolved electron microscopy data under the guidance of graduate student mentors.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The assembly of epitaxially connected nanocrystals with atomically coherent interfaces and mesoscale order provides a route to materials with interesting emergent properties. However, the irreversible nature of the attachment process often leads to nonequilibrium defect formation at the interfaces, which can limit ultimate materials performance. A suite of in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments are used to understand the process of oriented attachment in colloidal nanocrystals.  Specifically, in-situ high resolution TEM experiments probe the fundamentals of dislocation dynamics in imperfectly attached particles. In addition, an automated HRTEM image analysis tool is used to determine faceting, number of step edges, and size of ensembles of single particles with atomic layer precision.  This tool is used to develop nanocrystal synthesis protocols for preparing atomically defined nanocrystals which should minimize defect formation during attachment.  Finally, alignment and attachment of nanocrystals are imaged in-situ at a liquid-liquid interface in a specially designed liquid phase TEM cell design based on bifunctionalized silicon nitride membranes.  In-situ techniques to study dynamics at liquid-liquid interfaces provide insight to many self-assembly processes at these dynamic interfaces.  Individually these experiments provide insights into each step of the oriented attachment process, and together they provide a unified picture of assembly processes from the atomic to mesoscale.  This project trains graduate students in advanced in-situ materials characterization tools and prepares them to be future scientific mentors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symmetries are present in our daily life and they are encoded mathematically by objects called groups. In recent decades, a lot of attention has been given to quantum phenomena. In this context, quantum symmetries appear, which are best described by group-like objects called tensor categories. Moreover, tensor categories are the language of quantum computation and topological phases of matter. Researchers would like to classify modular categories (a distinguished class of tensor categories) because of their applications in condensed matter physics and quantum computing. In particular, unitary modular categories are algebraic models of anyons, which have applications in topological quantum computing. This model also has the advantage of being a fault-tolerance model of anyons, since small perturbations will not change the physical properties of the quantum system.<br/><br/>Tensor categories can be thought of as the categorical version of rings. This notion includes representation of groups, Lie algebras, and Hopf algebras. The project will consist of three main programs: classification, construction, and study of homological properties of tensor categories. One of the aims is to advance on the classification of low-rank premodular categories and supermodular categories. Another goal of this project is to understand how the cohomology behaves under standard constructions and use these results to get new examples of Hopf algebras and categories satisfying certain properties, such as the finite generation of cohomology for Hopf algebras and tensor categories, proposed by Etingof and Ostrik. The investigator will explore generalizations of the support variety theory. These are geometrical objects that measure projectivity, in the context of finite tensor categories. The last goal of the project is to search for new constructions of finite tensor categories, using Hopf algebras, and modular tensor categories, via gauging the symmetry with a focus on permutation actions on Deligne products of a given modular category.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Successful internship programs that integrate work-based learning and undergraduate research experiences can increase the competitiveness of community college-trained students for these positions. The City College of San Francisco (CCSF) is collaborating with the Office of Career Planning and Development at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) to address this problem.  This collaboration aims to align the Biotechnology Internship program at CCSF with the PhD-level Mentor Training program at UCSF. The CCSF students will work on research projects under supervision of UCSF mentors, while both are being trained on how to build effective mentor/intern relationships.  In this way, the project will support productive relationships between UCSF mentors and their CCSF interns. This collaborative mentor/intern model is expected to help the interns develop technical and employability skills, and help mentors enhance their ability to train and supervise a diverse workforce. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to increase the number of CCSF interns who work with trained UCSF mentors and to improve the quality of the intern-mentor relationship.  The project aims to achieve these goals through an evidence-based, iterative approach to curriculum and program development by: a) identifying the needs of the CCSF students and their UCSF mentors; b) modifying the CCSF Internship and UCSF Mentor Training programs to respond to unaddressed needs; and c) examining whether joint interventions to align both training curricula improves the intern's and mentor's experience.  The project includes a research component that can contribute new knowledge about and understanding of practices that increase the success of mentored research experiences.  Furthermore, enhanced curricula, interventions, and tools identified by this project can be used more broadly to develop and enhance professional development for internship programs, graduate and postdoctoral training of mentors, faculty training, and industry professional training, with a focus on improved retention of diverse student populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These problems appear to have little in common with each other, nor do they seem to have any obvious applications, and yet a deeper look reveals many subtle connections between them and possible applications to other areas of applied and theoretical science. For example, the question ""how many alternating sign matrices of order N exist?"" which was asked by mathematicians in the 1980s in connection with an obscure algorithm proposed by the logician Charles Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll) in the 19th century turned out to have connections to ""square ice,"" an exotic form of water ice that was detected experimentally a few years ago by British researchers. Similarly, the Witten zeta function, which the investigator plans to study in connection with the enumeration of certain types of symmetry, was previously studied by other researchers (including the physicist Edward Witten) in a different context related to problems in quantum field theory. It is these sorts of connections that the investigator hopes to shed light on through his research, and which make pure mathematics such a fruitful area of study for the advancement of human knowledge.<br/><br/>The specific problems the investigator proposes to study are questions at the interface of enumerative, algebraic and asymptotic combinatorics, with connections to other branches of mathematics, notably representation theory, probability theory, asymptotic analysis, and number theory. For example, one problem involves a new direction in asymptotic representation theory, namely that of finding asymptotic formulas for the number of n-dimensional representations of a Lie group as n grows large. The investigator's recent paper solved this problem for the group SU(3) using a difficult analysis of the so-called Witten zeta function associated with the group, which highlighted some intriguing connections between the problem and seemingly unrelated questions in analytic number theory and the theory of modular forms. In an additional part of the project, the investigator proposes to author a monograph on alternating sign matrices, which have been the subject of great interest since their discovery in the 1980s and are related to many contemporary research topics in combinatorics, probability theory and statistical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Industries in the rural communities served by Santa Fe College in Florida have increasing demand for highly-skilled and effective technicians. To address this need, Santa Fe College will develop educational resources to promote participation in STEM disciplines and awareness of career possibilities in STEM by providing unique experiences for students. The project will design a single multidisciplinary course to engage students in the scientific methods used for research and analysis. Three different versions of the course will be developed to include a hands-on project focused on either guitar building, rocketry, or robotics. The math, technology, and science skills will be woven throughout these student projects. The courses will be offered to students at three rural educational centers. These students include those who are transitioning from secondary to postsecondary education and first-time college students. Many students in these populations are unfamiliar with STEM technician jobs.  The project aims to enhance student abilities and promote interest in career opportunities that will help strengthen the nation's STEM technician workforce.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project will be to: 1) create and implement a project-based Research and Analysis course with three experiential learning project options: guitar building, robotics, and rocketry; 2) provide faculty professional development to ensure consistent implementation of the pedagogy at three rural educational centers; 3) engage a minimum of three local businesses in development and implementation of career exploration presentations and/or videos; and 4) evaluate the change in STEM career attitudes and intentions of program participants through a pre- and post-test research study. Curriculum development will use evidence-based pedagogical practices designed to mitigate stereotype threat and enhance self-efficacy. Building on the work of others, this project will adapt, integrate, and enhance relevant curriculum and resources from other ATE projects, to meet the needs of Santa Fe College's students and community. Because of the rural nature of the participating educational centers, students will include a higher than average percentage of low socioeconomic status students and first-time college students. The project aims to emphasize collaboration with industry partners to better meet employer needs for STEM technicians, and to connect students with industry so they obtain firsthand knowledge of requirements for developing a successful career. The change in STEM attitudes and interest in STEM careers will be measured using a validated pre-post analysis. The results of this project will be disseminated through project presentations and publications, and shared on the ATE Central website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While previous archaeological studies have explored this phenomenon in the context of subjugated Native populations, few have considered how the independent development of ""pericolonial"" pastoral traditions spurred societal changes among unconquered indigenous groups. The non-coerced adoption of sheep by Navajo frontier communities in 17th and 18th century New Mexico and the subsequent evolution of an intensely pastoral lifeway that continues to this day stand out as unique sociocultural developments in the Southwest. The ENPLP will investigate the mechanisms by which early Navajos successfully negotiated the entry of Old World domesticates and their attendant social and landscape impacts while remaining free from Spanish hegemony. This work will allow the researchers to examine the complexity of Navajo societal responses to more than four centuries of Euro-American colonialism in the Southwest, as well as contribute an important long-term perspective to ongoing efforts to preserve and sustain traditional Navajo culture. Such work has the potential to prove significant for researchers outside the American Southwest exploring an array of anthropological topics including pastoralism, colonialism, and indigenous identity politics.<br/><br/>The ENPLP will examine the pericolonial impacts of incipient pastoralism on the social organization and settlement patterns of early Navajo communities in the Dintah region of northwest New Mexico. The oldest known center of Navajo settlement in the Southwest, Dintah was the center of a number of sociocultural shifts in Navajo society during the Gobernador Phase (c. AD 1626-1775), including population growth, fortress construction, and migration away from the region. Although previous researchers have suggested these changes are related to the rise of Navajo sheepherding practices following Spanish colonization circa AD 1600, this relationship remains poorly understood. The ENPLP will employ a collaborative three-phase research program involving both Native and non-Native archaeologists to address these questions. In Phase One, the participant-observation of modern sheepherding practices on the Navajo Nation will be used to identify interpretive analogs for early Navajo pastoral land use. Phase Two will build on the ethnoarchaeology to create a geospatial model for early Navajo pastoral site location and land use. Phase Three will employ intensive site mapping and geoarchaeological testing to distinguish potential Navajo pastoral sites by identifying nearby corral-related dung deposits in the Dintah region. These data will be combined with archival data from previous Cultural Resource Management projects in order to determine the spatial and material correlates of Gobernador Phase Navajo pastoral sites. Together this information will be used to assess the extent, intensity, and type of herding strategies employed by Gobernador Phase Navajo groups in Dintah, as well as evidence for social differentiation based on access to livestock.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This equation was derived more that a hundred years ago to explain the behavior of long waves in channels of shallow water.  In the 1960s, researchers at Princeton's Plasma Physics Laboratory demonstrated that this equation exhibits a wealth of novel features, which have sparked the interest of mathematicians and physicists alike.  However, despite all the attention it has received over the years, existence of solutions under minimal assumptions has been proved only recently by the PI and her collaborators.  One ingredient in their work is the recent discovery of new conservation laws.  This project outlines several additional problems that can now be attacked using this discovery.  Another major impetus behind this project is to prove that complicated transient dynamics resolve into simple dynamics in the distant future.  The physical significance of this phenomenon relies on its stability under perturbations.  While in the past, the PI has investigated deterministic perturbations to the equations, the current project takes this theme in a new direction by considering stability in the presence of (random) noise.  <br/><br/>The project focuses on several problems that lie at the intersection of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations, completely integrable systems, and stochastic partial differential equations.  The PI's discovery of new microscopic conservation laws for KdV has opened the door to treating three seemingly unrelated problems of long-standing interest regarding KdV on the line: optimal regularity well-posedness, symplectic non-squeezing, and invariance of white noise.  In addition, the PI is proposing a coherent plan for establishing invariance of the Gibbs measure for the Landau-Lifshitz model and invariance of white noise for the focusing cubic Nonlinear Schr\""odinger Equation (NLS).  This program involves establishing the analogous statements for the physical atomic models associated with these problems (which the PI has successfully completed) and then taking the continuum limit for the corresponding rough data.  This should reveal the physical renormalizations for the Landau-Lifshitz and the cubic NLS models that would ensure well-posedness for such data.  As the Gibbs measure for the Landau-Lifshitz model corresponds to Brownian motion on the sphere, this problem is also interesting from a purely probabilistic point of view as yielding a Hamiltonian measure-preserving flow on such paths.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical area of the US industrial biotechnology sector is the conversion of biomass and other renewable feedstocks to high value and commodity chemicals. K. marxianus can grow at high temperature in high acidity, and on a wide range of different sugars.  These are important traits for economic bioprocesses. The project will develop new genetic engineering tools for this yeast and apply these tools to engineer the bio-production of two important classes of chemicals that are traditionally produced from petroleum feedstocks. The project will also contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the development of new educational outreach programs for high school and community college students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The overall goal is to establish K. marxianus as a platform host for the production of a broad range of biobased chemicals. Critical to advancing K. marxianus is the development of new synthetic biology tools that can rapidly create strains with multiple genome edits and that can accurately control transcription of native and heterologous genes. This project addresses these challenges by (1) developing new enabling tools and methods for rapid strain development and genome engineering in this yeast species, and (2) applying the tools for metabolic engineering of pathways leading to commercially significant native (acetate esters) and non-native (polyketide) products. Phenylethyl and isoamyl acetate are valuable fragrance/flavor compounds and are used as industrial solvents. Polyketides have significant value as pharmaceuticals, including as antibiotic, anticancer, and cholesterol-lowering drugs. The rationale behind this project is that K. marxianus is a highly promising microbial host for non-aseptic (and aseptic) bioprocesses that can convert a range of different sugars into high-value and industrially-relevant chemicals and proteins. This research is transformational because it develops new synthetic biology tools and metabolic engineering approaches to harness and enhance the native traits of K. marxianus, enabling new bioprocesses for the conversion of renewable feedstocks to valuable products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computerized mechanized welding and cutting machines weld and cut 300 percent faster than manual methods. Automated electronics enable the welding and cutting processes to be more precise, as well as offering the potential to control and document the entire process. The fabrication and joining industry is rapidly adopting these new computerized technologies and advanced processes. As a result, a growing need exists for welding technicians who have more extensive knowledge of metallurgy, nondestructive examination, quality control, computerized data acquisition, and technical writing and reporting. In collaboration with industry partners, this project at Central Arizona College aims to develop curricula and associated materials for an advanced fabrication and joining program to prepare Advanced Welding Processes Technicians. It will include higher-level education and training not offered by most community college welding programs. Since the college is a both an Hispanic Serving Institution and a rural community college, this project will strive to encourage students from minority backgrounds to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) credentials. The curriculum, STEM content, and project-based learning exercises will be shared with the National Center for Welding Education and Training, the seven Hispanic Serving Institutions participating in the Science Foundation of Arizona Kick Starter project, and other community colleges. The welding programs at community colleges involved in the Science Foundation of Arizona will provide feedback on the effectiveness of the new curriculum and associated materials. This feedback will support the effort of the college to create quality learning products that foster student learning and help meet the country?s need for personnel with advanced fabrication and joining skills.<br/><br/>Developing curriculum and associated materials in advanced fabrication and joining processes is the first step in meeting the need for fabricators and welders with additional knowledge of data acquisition, metallurgy, and quality control land welding codes to ensure quality welds. Six new courses will be developed that will form a core advanced certificate, and four additional courses will be developed for the advanced processes technician specialization. The ten courses will be field-tested in the classroom during the second half of the three-year project, with at least ten students in the first cohort. Feedback from the students, their instructors, and industry partners will guide subsequent improvements to the curriculum. Students in the college certificate and associate degree welding programs, incumbent workers who need advanced skills, and students from other community college welding programs will be recruited to the program. The project will create project-based learning exercises and contextualized STEM content for the program.  These practices are research-validated best practices for teaching technical and science-based skills to learners, especially those from traditionally under-represented and disadvantaged backgrounds,. Project-based learning provides contextualized, authentic experiences (i.e. experiences that mimic what workers do in their jobs) that help students master challenging STEM concepts and processes.  This approach makes the science more understandable for students because it places the material in a real-world context (such as a welding shop) and often builds on content students have already mastered.  In this way, students can discover meaningful relationships between academic theory and practical, real world applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will investigate the effect that these types of particles have on human cell metabolism.  The project will also engage with local area high school students, and HS teachers, many who serve underrepresented minority (URM) populations.

Such automation can result in loss of lower skill jobs, as well as create opportunities for new, often higher skill jobs.  Some studies suggest that more than 60% of the jobs in the inland region of southern California are automatable and, therefore at risk.  To buffer this potential job loss, the Riverside Community College District/Norco Campus will develop a work-based learning program in the field of advanced manufacturing automation.  This program will include accredited apprenticeships, coursework, certificates, and degree pathways. Apprenticeships are a potential solution for employers seeking to build their workforce and for students pursuing greater career opportunities. Norco College will establish and expand partnerships with employers and develop curriculum related to work-based learning and apprenticeship. This apprenticeship project aims to provide students with a foundation of technical knowledge in automation and manufacturing, as well as hands-on experiences in the industry.<br/><br/>The project aims to respond to the need for highly-qualified technicians in automation by: (1) developing a comprehensive apprenticeship program to train technicians to fill emerging automation-related technical occupations; (2) building partnerships with industry to ensure industry needs are being met, and to increase employer engagement; (3) implementing new strategies to support student recruitment, retention, and completion targeting underrepresented student populations (including women); (4) supporting existing apprenticeship programs; and (5) encouraging the implementation of accredited apprenticeship programs nationwide.  These efforts will be coordinated with the state and federal apprenticeship agencies, the local Workforce Development Boards, and the California Community College system, with the goal of developing a systematic approach to apprenticeship opportunities in the region.

Its main goal is to better understand how to build and sustain the capacity of elementary science teachers in grades 3-5 to instruct and formatively assess students in ways that are aligned with contemporary science education frameworks and standards. To achieve this goal, the project will use classroom-based science assessment as a focus around which to build teacher capacity in science instruction and three-dimensional learning in science. The three dimensions will include disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. These dimensions are described in the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council; NRC, 2012), and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States, 2013). The project will work closely with teachers to co-develop usable assessments and rubrics and help them to learn about three-dimensional assessment and instruction. Also, the project will work with teachers to test the developed assessments in diverse settings, and to create an active, online community of practice. <br/><br/>The two research questions will be: (1) How well do these assessments function with respect to aspects of validity for classroom use, particularly in terms of indicators of student proficiency, and tools to support teacher instructional practice?; and (2) In what ways do providing these assessment tasks and rubrics, and supporting teachers in their use, advance teachers' formative assessment practices to support multi-dimensional science instruction? The research and development components of this project will produce assessments and rubrics, which can directly impact students and teachers in the districts and states that have adopted the NGSS, as well as those that have embraced the vision of science teaching and learning embodied in the NRC Framework. The project will consist of five major tasks. First, the effort will iteratively develop assessments and rubrics for formative use, using an evidence-centered design approach. Second, it will collect data from evidence-based revision and redesign of the assessments from teachers piloting the assessments and rubrics, project cognitive laboratory studies with students, and an external review of the assessments design products. Third, it will study teachers' classroom use of assessments to understand and document how they blend assessment and instruction. The project will use pre/post questionnaires, video recordings, observation field notes, and pre/post interviews. Fourth, the study will build the capacity of participating teachers. Teacher Collaborators (n=9) will engage in participatory design of the assessment tasks and act as technical assistants to the overall implementation process. Teacher Implementers (n=15) will use the assessments formatively as part of their instructional practice. Finally, the work will develop a community of learners through the development of a technical assistance infrastructure, and leveraging teacher expertise to formatively assess students' work, using the assessments designed to be diagnostic and instructionally informative. External reviewers and an advisory board will provide formative feedback on the project's processes and summative evaluation of the project's results. The main outcomes of this endeavor will be prototypes of elementary science multi-dimensional assessments and new knowledge for the field on the underlying theory for developing teachers' capacity for engaging in multi-dimensional science instruction, learning, and assessment.<br/><br/>The DRK-12 Program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

There are many systems that exhibit this behavior. The values of the temperature throughout an object, the concentration of some chemical, or the population density in migration are some examples of quantities that show diffusive behavior. In mathematical analysis, the prime example of a diffusive equation is the heat equation, or the more general family of parabolic partial differential equations. The purpose of this research project is to study non-standard diffusion. The project explores regularization effects in nonlinear equations that are outside the classical framework of parabolic equations. The research studies non-local equations, where the evolution of the value at any point depends on the global picture, and applies those methods in equations from statistical mechanics modeling the density of particles in a dilute gas. The project also studies conservation law equations, a fundamental class of partial differential equation, and aims to explicate regularization properties there as well. The project will involve graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the research.  Results will be disseminated through publications, conferences, and summer schools.<br/><br/>The study of non-local equations, and more precisely integro-differential equations, is a very active area of research. Recent work indicates that some of the ideas and methods developed in that area can be used to obtain regularity estimates for the Boltzmann equation from statistical mechanics. This research project aims at proving that if the solution of the Boltzmann equation ever develops a singularity, then some hydrodynamic quantity must be unbounded. These hydrodynamic quantities are the mass, energy, and entropy density, which correspond to physically meaningful properties of the fluid. Thus, the project aims to establish that if there is a singularity in the mesoscopic description of the fluid given by the Boltzmann equation, it must be apparent macroscopically. The Boltzmann equation can be rewritten as a parabolic integro-differential equation, and the restriction on its hydrodynamic quantities determines the non-degeneracy of the corresponding kernel. This connection between integro-differential equations and the Boltzmann equation is also useful as a guide for further development of the former subject. The study of regularization mechanisms using methods from parabolic equations applied to conservation law equations is arguably even more surprising. In scalar conservation laws, the solution is transported following a velocity that depends on the value at every point. Shock singularities are unavoidable for smooth initial data; however, the same shock mechanism forces some self-organization that translates into a regularization effect when starting from very rough initial data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lack of diversity in the supply chain for REEs, coupled with significant environmental impacts of primary mining, have made extraction of REEs from secondary sources an attractive alternative.

The objectives of this work are to 1) quantify the material and energy flows of emerging secondary REE extraction processes and their primary alternatives, 2) create a framework to compare economic and environmental performance of primary and secondary sources of rare earth elements, and 3) make recommendations for development of viable domestic supply chains and manufacturing. <br/><br/>Methodologies from life-cycle assessment, commodity market modeling, material characterization, and techno-economic analysis will be synthesized to assess processes to recover REEs from byproducts, e.g. coal ash, phosphogypsum, red mud, and electronic waste.

Lindsey. Professor Lindsey is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University. He is developing methods to create chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls (molecules that nature used to harvest energy from light) in the laboratory from simple starting materials in a straightforward manner. The synthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls has never been fully accomplished in this manner. The ability to build such molecules along with analogues will afford a much deeper understanding of energy flow in photosynthesis (an area that impacts biophysics, plant sciences, energy generation), the nature of metabolic breakdown products (an area that impacts ecology, global carbon balance), and the chemical properties of such compounds (an area that impacts nutrition, medicine).  The project mainly involves organic chemistry but will also impact diverse areas of science including understanding of photosynthesis. Thus, the project is well suited for the education and training of scientists in a collaborative environment.  Professor Lindsey's group is well-positioned to provide this experience for students underrepresented in science.  In addition, outreach activities involving North Carolina teachers will also be part of the funded project.  <br/><br/><br/>Chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls are the chief pigments in photosynthetic organisms, including plants, cyanobacteria, and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria.  The lack of synthetic methods for preparing (bacterio)chlorophylls and analogues constitutes an intellectual and technical deficit in the photosynthetic sciences.  The Lindsey lab proposes to fill this chasm by developing robust methods for synthesis of such valuable macrocycles.  The particular challenges in synthesizing (bacterio)chlorophylls include (1) the stereochemistry of substituents in the pyrroline ring(s), (2) the fifth (isocyclic) ring, and (3) substituents arrayed about the perimeter of the macrocycle. The intellectual merit of the work concerns the development of routes for the synthesis of the key photosynthetic pigments and analogues; the latter have broad impact (beyond the scope of the present grant) encompassing studies of quantum coherence in photosynthesis and catabolism in ecology.  A key outcome is a methodology in heterocyclic chemistry for preparing pyrroles, pyrrolines, dipyrromethanes, hydrodipyrrins, and phyllobilins relevant to the (bacterio)chlorophylls of photosynthesis.  The broader impacts entail professional development of middle and high school science teachers to improve teaching of photosynthesis (via a chlorophyll-based experiment) in schools and to inspire middle and high school students to STEM, thereby broadening the participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An example of the resonance phenomenon is the sound we hear after striking a bell: it has a frequency of oscillation (the tone) and a rate of decay (how soon we stop hearing the sound), which both depend on the shape of the bell. The frequency and the decay rate that we hear correspond to the real and imaginary part of the least-decaying resonance of the bell. Eigenvalues and resonances have innumerable applications in physics and engineering. A major goal of this project is to understand how the distribution of eigenvalues and resonances depends on the system (for example, how the shape of the bell determines how long it will sound); while this topic has seen recent progress, there remain many important open questions. The project includes research projects for graduate students and numerical experiments for undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The project employs microlocal analysis, which is the mathematical theory explaining the classical/quantum, or particle/wave, correspondence. For instance, the high-energy distribution of resonances in the simplest model of a bell is related to the classical dynamical system of billiard ball trajectories inside the bell: for bounded times, waves approximately propagate along billiard ball trajectories. However, for long times this approximation becomes worse and eventually breaks down. An especially interesting situation is when the classical system has chaotic behavior; the implications for eigenfunctions and resonances are studied in the field of quantum chaos. Part of the project is centered around the fractal uncertainty principle, which is a new tool beyond the classical/quantum correspondence, established through use of harmonic analysis, fractal geometry, and combinatorics. The fractal uncertainty principle has already seen several applications, including progress towards the conjecture that all strongly chaotic open systems have exponential wave decay. Another part of the project is the study of classical, or Pollicott-Ruelle, resonances, using microlocal methods -- a rare example of the reversal of the classical/quantum correspondence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The properties of each metal depend strongly on its crystal structure, also known as its phase. For example, tantalum (Ta) in its stable cubic phase is ductile and is a good conductor of electricity. It is widely used in integrated circuits and thin film capacitors. In 1965, Mildred Read and Carl Altman discovered that, in certain atom-by-atom thin film deposition processes, Ta can also be made in a metastable tetragonal phase which is brittle and has much lower electrical conductivity. Use of this phase has been limited to thin film resistors. However, in 2012, an electronic effect (giant spin Hall effect) was discovered in the metastable phase, which promises to revolutionize information storage by making significant further miniaturization of computer devices possible. Thus, there is now much interest in the ability to reliably produce the metastable phase. As it turns out, all of the elements from group 5 and 6 in the periodic table, which, in addition to Ta, include tungsten (W), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), vanadium (V), and niobium (Nb), have the same stable crystal structure at all temperatures and pressures, and, with the exception of Nb, metastable phases have been reported for all of them (a metastable Nb phase has been predicted, but not realized). This leads to the prospect that, if the metastable phases can be reliably produced in all of these metals, this may open up a class of new materials with potentially interesting properties. Indeed, it has recently been shown that the metastable phase in W has an even stronger giant spin Hall effect than Ta. However, with the exception of metastable Ta, and now W, the metastable phases of these elements have primarily been laboratory curiosities. Neither their formation mechanisms nor their properties are known. In this research, detailed analyses of the first few atomic layers that form as thin films of Ta, W, Cr, Mo, V, and Nb are deposited, atom by atom, onto a substrate will be used to determine how and why the metastable phases form. In addition, a unique ultra-high vacuum deposition system that is capable of making very pure films under a wide range of conditions will be used to explore the range of conditions under which metastable phase films of these materials can be made. Finally studies of the atomic arrangements and properties such as hardness, electrical conductivity, and electronic effects in those films will provide information about possible new applications for these new materials. In addition to fundamental understanding about why certain phases form, this work should enable technologists to develop new applications using these materials and to determine how to control process parameters to reliably obtain metastable films with desired properties for those applications. In particular, this work has the potential to revolutionize computer random access memory technology, which would enable the development of several generations of higher performance microelectronic devices. In addition, approximately 16 students, including 2 PhD students, 2 MS students, and 12 undergraduate students (6 from Cornell and 6 from Houghton College, a small undergraduate liberal arts college in upstate New York) will engage in this effort. All students will be mentored to come up to speed on the goals, participate in the research, and to present their work in both talks and papers. The net effect will be very high-level training for these future STEM professionals. Finally, the project will involve numerous outreach activities to local area schools and institutions, including presentations, demonstrations, curricular assistance, tutoring (especially for disadvantaged/underrepresented students), and many others. These activities are intended to inform the public about the practice, value, and accomplishments of science, including this project, and to encourage students to pursue STEM fields as they see fit.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The group 5 and 6 elements, Ta, W, Cr, Mo, V, and Nb, are well known for having only one equilibrium crystal structure, the body-centered-cubic phase, at all temperatures and pressures. In addition, it has been shown that in certain atom-by-atom fabrication processes such as sputter deposition, metastable phases can be made in all but Nb (metastable Nb has been predicted, but not realized). However, very little is known about the mechanism by which these phases form, and, with the exception of metastable beta-Ta and beta-W, very little is known about their properties. Recently there has been a spike in interest generated by the discovery of the giant spin Hall effect in both beta-Ta and beta-W. In the present program, phase formation mechanisms and the relationships among film deposition parameters, microstructure, and properties, will be studied for the group 5 and 6 elements. Phase formation will be studied using reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to characterize the initial phases of film growth by molecular beam. The extent to which metastable phases can be produced in W, Cr, Mo, V, and Nb will be determined in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) sputter deposition system that provides a wide range of deposition parameters (temperature, bias, power, sputter mode) and is capable of reducing oxygen and other impurities to extremely low levels. The effect of various deposition parameters on microstructure will be studied using x-ray diffraction (XRD), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and other methods, and the stability of the metastable phase will be studied by determining stress change (as an indication of phase change) in-situ during heating in the UHV system. Finally, hardness and elastic modulus will be determined using nanoindentation and electrical conductivity will be measured with a four-point probe. This work is expected to provide fundamental details regarding the mechanism of metastable phase formation and the crystal structures of the metastable phases in the group 5 and 6 metals, as well as descriptions of the conditions under which those phases can be grown and the relationships among those deposition conditions and the microstructure and properties of the resulting films.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With collaborators, the PI will incorporate algebraic geometric methods (particularly Hodge theory, positivity, and genericity) into geometric combinatorics with the goal of understanding the possible face numbers of certain polyhedral complexes. By refining established techniques, he will investigate sharper inequalities among face number which will elucidate combinatorial structures. He will also deepen the commutative algebraic underpinnings of his recent work on matroids. In Diophantine geometry, he will study bounds on the number of rational and torsion points on curves.

The current research focuses on lightweight Mg metal deformation, which is of interest to the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries. The research (including both experimental activities and computational modeling) provides insights into improved design and manufacture for these applications. Students involved in this research find employment within the materials, automotive or aerospace manufacturing sectors, and some go on to research careers which serve the nation's interests in energy, defense, or education. An outreach program seeks to develop enthusiasm for materials science, and science and engineering more generally in local elementary school students in Charlottesville and the surrounding rural area. Within this program, the role of strong, yet light-weight materials is demonstrated in efficient transportation - from the Wright brothers' first flight to modern vehicles, like Tesla electric cars and drones. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The objective of the proposed research is to determine the degree to which dislocation climb and cross-slip accommodate strain during the polycrystal plasticity of non-cubic metals. Lightweight Mg and its alloys are selected for this study because of the world-wide interest in increasing the efficiency of transportation as well as the scientific convenience that the near-thermo-elastic isotropy of Mg crystals simplifies the analysis of plastic anisotropy. Textured samples of pure Mg and commercial alloys will be tested under creep and stress-relaxation conditions along different directions with respect to the initial texture. While there is already published data for these materials, a controversy regarding the roles of cross-slip and climb remains. Quantitative accounting for the effect of initial texture, various dislocation types (with a, c, and c+a Burgers vectors), as well as the evolution of the dislocation substructure (largely unstudied in non-cubic materials) will settle the issue. The approach is multi-scale, addressing the macroscale, mesoscale and microscale. MACROSCALE creep and stress relaxation experiments are performed on textured polycrystalline samples, and texture evolution and strain anisotropy are measured on samples crept to significant strain levels. The results of macroscale experiments guide selection of specific stress and temperature conditions to explore with meso- and micro-scale characterization. A new technique known as in situ high energy X-ray diffraction (HEXD) reveals the MESOSCALE distribution of full stress tensors and dislocation contents (including the densities of different types, Burgers vector and line direction) within individual grains of a polycrystal. Information that was previously relegated to single crystal experiments or very small numbers of grains in a polycrystal has only recently become available for statistically significant numbers (hundreds) of grains within polycrystals, and a new polycrystal plasticity model, which accounts for dislocation climb, is used to interpret the HEXD data. Finally, X-ray diffraction line profile analysis and transmission electron microscopy (including in situ straining) experiments elucidate the MICROSCALE dislocation densities, reveal critical dislocation configurations and their kinetic descriptions in terms of specific thermally activated unit processes. The interpretation of the results is aided by discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulation, used to explore the effects of these dislocation ensembles and how they recover. Graduate students are trained in advanced experimental characterization and modeling techniques. With guidance, undergraduate students also perform some of the experiments and analyses, especially at the macroscale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genealogical trees for small parts of the Tree of Life are called `phylogenies' by biologists; there is more interest in phylogenies today than at any time in the past. Phylogenies are crucial in fields such as epidemiology where they are used to track the spread of infectious disease and molecular biology where they are used to understand how molecular pathways developed. The `Tree of Life' can be discovered by comparing the characteristics of different organisms. Traditionally, phylogenies were reconstructed by comparing anatomical traits across different species. More recently, DNA sequence information from individual genes, or even full genomes, are compared to estimate phylogenies. This project will continue the development of the RevBayes computer program that biologists use to reconstruct phylogenies. The program takes as input the comparative information from the organisms of interest. The output of the program is the probabilities of the best phylogenies that explain the comparative data. Specifically, the project will improve the speed, usability, and reliability of the program.<br/><br/>RevBayes is the successor of the MrBayes program which is widely used by biologists to estimate phylogeny. However, the RevBayes program represents a significant departure from MrBayes. The RevBayes program implements an R-like language to describe statistical models. The model is represented in computer memory as a graph in which the vertices of the graph are the parameters and the edges represent the dependencies between parameters.

Genome-wide proteomics studies provide a growing list of putative protein-protein interactions, and demonstrate that most if not all proteins have interacting partners in the cell. However, these techniques can only identify whether two proteins possibly interact. A full comprehension of how proteins bind and form complexes can only come from high-resolution three-dimensional structures, since they provide the atomic details necessary to understand how the interactions occur and how the high degree of specificity can be achieved.  While the most complete structural characterization is provided by X-ray crystallography, many biologically important interactions occur in weak, transient complexes that are not amenable to direct experimental analysis, even when both proteins can be isolated and their structures determined. The goal of this project is to further improve the protein-protein docking server ClusPro that, starting from the structures of component proteins, attempts to determine the structure of their complexes with accuracy close to that provided by X-ray crystallography. The server at https://cluspro.org  already has close to 10,000 registered users, although it can also be used without registration. Docked structures generated by ClusPro have been reported in over 600 research papers. The public server is important for biological and chemical scientists who may not have extensive computational experience but still will be able to use state of the art docking methods. The increased availability of protein complex structures will have major impact in many areas of biology, biochemistry, and biotechnology. <br/><br/>The project has six aims focusing on problems of increasing difficulty. First, a new opportunity to progress is provided by earlier development of the manifold fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation algorithm, which increased the speed of sampling by orders of magnitude. An additional advantage of the method is that increasing the number of correlation function terms is computationally inexpensive. Therefore, Aim 1 is the development and implementation of complex energy functions, including distance-dependent and three-body potentials for scoring. Second, recently developed methods have shown considerable promise in predicting contacts between residues in proteins using evolutionary covariance information. The problem is that these methods require large numbers of evolutionarily related sequences of interacting proteins to robustly assess the extent of residue covariation. Aim 2 is exploring how sequence information can be used for extracting inter-protein contacts to improve docking results even with somewhat limited number of sequences. Third, with the increase in the number of protein complex structures, there is increasing need for integrating direct docking and template-based prediction methods, and several strategies will be explored to implement such integration. Fourth, the docking method will be modified to work optimally with homology models rather than X-ray structures of interacting proteins. The fifth aim is exploring new approaches to the docking of proteins with substantial backbone conformational changes upon binding. The sixth and final aim is implementing the newly developed algorithms in the ClusPro server.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex interactions between spins - quantized ""compass needles"" carried by electrons bound to crystal lattices - provide magnetic matter with desirable quantum coherence properties.  For instance, a special state of matter called a ""quantum spin-liquids"" could be used for new quantum information and sensing technologies.  However, these strange new quantum states involve many spins and are incredibly challenging to both predict and measure in real materials.  This experimental research brings together materials science, spectroscopy, and modeling to discover if and how macroscopic quantum effects emerge in networks of interacting spins.  The project focuses on an unexplored set of inorganic compounds that are designed for new types of behavior.  This research will utilize neutron spectroscopy to accurately map spin states in custom-grown samples and so, probe directly predictions from realistic theoretical models.  Professional researchers in the project will team with high-school students, their teachers, and undergraduate students to generate a long-lasting interest for materials research and provide the network needed to support the future quantum workforce.  Participants not only train in sample growth and cryogenic measurements in the principal investigator's laboratory, but also get involved in experiments at world-class facilities for crystal growth and neutron scattering, for instance at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Participants subsequently engage the general and university public to expose the beauty of ""the Universe"" within condensed matter and communicate the promise of the quantum materials revolution.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>Correlated magnetic insulators are unique materials at the heart of the current quantum revolution. They often provide definitive answers to a universal question: how do macroscopic quantum phenomena emerge in crystalline matter from assemblies of atomic-scale entities? Several systems of interacting spins host desirable quantum phases with no classical analogues - characterized by a high degree of entanglement, their excitations are non-local like spinons or Majorana fermions. In most cases, however, these many-body states are difficult to predict with existing techniques. Realizing and detecting genuine quantum phases in real materials is therefore extremely challenging. This experimental research merges in-house efforts with the use of world-class centers for crystal growth and inelastic neutron-scattering in the United States to track and expose quantum phenomena in triangular networks of interacting spins. Low-dimensional and geometrically frustrated, triangular-lattice antiferromagnets are at the boundary between semi-classical and quantum behaviors. This tendency, when combined with spin-space anisotropies and quantum fluctuations tuned by compositional variations, produces novel phases and quasiparticles. The research activities advance inelastic neutron scattering instrumentation and data analysis tools to accurately map spin excitations in laboratory-grown samples and to benchmark predictions from realistic models. Three related directions are explored: (1) nonlinear dynamics and possible breakdown of magnon quasiparticles in transition-metal compounds; (2) spin-orbit-induced anisotropies and spin-liquid phenomenology in rare-earth magnets; (3) discovery and characterization of new triangular-lattice materials. Teams of high-school, undergraduate and graduate students participate in every step of the research process in the principal investigator's laboratory and at large-scale central facilities. Mentoring of participants by professional researchers provides the scaffolding needed to support the future quantum workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the extensive progress in programming languages in the past few decades, today's mainstream operating systems and hypervisors are still written in C-like low-level languages.  There seems to be an inherent conflict between high-level formal reasoning and low-level systems programming: the former relies on a rich theory at a high abstraction level while the latter must manipulate and manage low-level effects and hardware resources.  The chief novelties of this project are (1) to design and implement a new language (named DeepSEA) that can be used to tackle this inherent conflict and directly program and synthesize certified software, and (2) to develop a DeepSEA toolchain and apply it to build certified OS kernels and Ethereum-style smart contracts. The project's impacts are demonstrated in multiple ways. The technology for building certified software will have a profound impact on the software industry and the society in general; it will dramatically improve the reliability and security of many key components in the world's critical infrastructure. The project would catalyze a change in the way computing science is taught at U.S. universities, by pushing new courses on formal methods into the existing curriculum; it would broaden the participation of underrepresented groups and give U.S. students a unique combination of technical training and international experience in this cutting-edge field.<br/><br/>Certified programming is a unique challenge for language design: both operating systems and smart contracts are inherently low-level and effectful, while software verification requires high-level abstractions and pure functions.  Recent projects on OS kernel verification required writing (manually) the actual kernel in a C-like language and a formal specification of the kernel in a proof-assistant language; a large part of the verification effort is then spent on showing that the implementation indeed satisfies the specification.  DeepSEA bridges this chasm automatically---from a single input program, one can derive the relation between abstract data types and bytes, and between functional specification and concrete implementation. Instead of having to choose between high- and low-level languages, DeepSEA can have the best of both.  The DeepSEA language provides native support for layered specification and abstraction refinement, full equational reasoning, a functional model of effects (including concurrency), and effect encapsulation and composition: consequently it directly supports certified programming at multiple abstraction levels.  Using DeepSEA, a programmer need only to write the formal specification of a desirable system; then the DeepSEA compiler will automatically compile the DeepSEA program into a certified artifact consisting of a C program (which is then compiled into assembly by the verified C compiler, CompCert), a Coq specification, and a formal (Coq) proof that the C program satisfies the specification. The project opens up a new space of language designs that can directly support the development of correct-by-construction system software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This air-sea interaction is a key factor in numerical modeling of hurricanes, but how this interaction changes in very high wind speeds is unknown due to the difficulty of making measurements in major hurricanes.  This project will make use of a large wave tank at the University of Miami that can generate winds of Category 5 hurricane intensity to fill the current gap in observations and to study the roles of wind and waves in air-sea interactions.  The project has the potential to improve numerical modeling of hurricanes, which directly impacts public safety and the economy.  The research team also plans to engage the public through a variety of outreach mechanisms, such as social media and facility tours.  The project will also help to train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The research team plans to establish new relationships for the air-sea momentum exchange in extreme wind and wave conditions with a focus on improving hurricane modeling.  The main goal of the project is to identify the roles of various wind and wave related processes in controlling the air-sea momentum transfer in high winds, and to measure the rate of transfer in such conditions.  The possible mechanisms cited by the research team are:  sheltering of the air flow in the lee of steep breaking waves, enhanced dissipation of waves by wind, and vertical density gradient decrease due to spray and foam entrainment.  The researchers hypothesize that the air-sea momentum transfer undergoes a fundamental change of governing physical processes between low-to-moderate, high, and extreme wind conditions.  To address this hypothesis, four main tasks are laid out:  1) Conduct a series of laboratory experiments in the SUrge-STructure-Atmosphere INteraction (SUSTAIN) facility at the Univ. of Miami; 2) Derive a new relationship between air-sea momentum flux and mean wind, wave-state, and spray concentration and streak coverage; 3) Formulate a new wind input source function; and 4) Conduct numerical simulations in a fully coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model and validate against field observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Free boundaries correspond to sharp changes in the variables describing the problem. While significant progress has been made in the study of free boundary problems, many important questions have yet to be studied in the case of nonlinear partial differential equations and especially equations of mixed type. For these cases, a better understanding of properties of free boundaries, such as stability, regularity and geometric structure, would make it possible to study complex phenomena in real-world applications. The primary focus of this project is the study of shock reflection problems in gas dynamics, one of the most fundamental multidimensional shock wave problems. The project will also have a broad impact through close interactions with engineering and meteorological communities and through training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The project consists of two main topics: (1) Free boundary problems in shock analysis. The PI will continue his work on self-similar shock reflection for potential flow and for full and isentropic Euler system. Shock reflection problems arise in many physical situations. Moreover, such problems are important in the mathematical theory of multidimensional conservation laws since their solutions are building blocks and asymptotic attractors of general solutions to the multidimensional Euler equations for compressible fluids. Self-similar equations of compressible fluid dynamics are of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type. Shocks correspond to discontinuities in the solution for Euler system, and in the gradient of the solution for potential flow equation. Type of equation may change from hyperbolic to elliptic across the shock. Shock reflection problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem in which unknown are the elliptic (subsonic) region and solution in the elliptic region. The PI will continue his work on existence, stability and regularity of global solutions of the regular reflection, to extend the global existence results to the case of compressible Euler system, which is a fundamental model of gas dynamics.  Further study includes uniqueness and stability for regular reflection problem in various classes of solutions. (2) Another area of the proposed research is semi-geostrophic system.

Recent work highlights the ability of climate models to predict such things as regional surface air temperature, precipitation, Arctic sea ice extent, and ocean heat content with several years lead time; such predictions are of great use to those who manage infrastructure and resources. The use of models for predictions of regional changes in ocean chemistry and biology on these timescales is much less common but could also be very useful to managers, policy makers, and the scientific enterprise. In this CAREER award, the investigator will use a model to make regional predictions of changes in ocean chemistry and biology on one- to ten-year timescales; these predictions will be tested against real-world observations to assess and understand the skill of the predictions.

Most scientific research on the Khoisan languages (the non-Bantu click languages of Africa), has focused on their sound systems because this complexity illuminates cognitive patterns and physiological mechanisms relevant for human language. However, because far less attention has been paid to their grammatical systems, Khoisan languages have had little or no impact on current syntactic theories. To achieve a deeper scientific knowledge of the Khoisan languages, this project will study morphosyntactic aspects of two completely undescribed languages: Cua and Tshila (classified as central Khoisan or Khoe-Kwadi languages). Such data sets will also clarify the linguistic classification of the central Khoisan languages, and their historical connections to other Khoisan languages. The project's training component will bring advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students to Botswana for hands-on training in linguistic research on the Khoisan languages. This will increase the number of researchers working on the highly endangered Khoisan languages while simultaneously increasing scientific knowledge about the linguistic properties possessed by these languages. The team will work closely with the language communities in developing materials and resources, of value to the communities and in educating participating students about broader impacts and community-academic collaborations. Also, because the U.S. State Department notes the importance of Botswana as a partner and as a model of stability in Africa, the national interest is served by strengthening on the ground connections and partnerships with the country and enhancing an international collaboration with the University of Botswana.<br/><br/>The project will investigate the unique syntactic and morphological structures of Cua and Tshila, important for theoretical and typological syntactic work. For example, the grammatical sketch will cover the complex system of pronouns. English has handful of pronouns. In subject position, these are: I, you (singular and plural), he, she, we, they. Central Khoisan languages have far more pronouns. Kua (a related Khoisan language) has 31 subject pronouns (factoring in person, number, gender). The same morphological features that characterize pronouns also characterize the person-gender-number (PGN) markers found on noun phrases. For example, in Kua &#967;am=&#449;oe includes two morpheme and is glossed ""lion=3MPS""; it means ""male lions"". The clitic (&#449;oe) encodes both the notion of plurality (more than two) and masculine reference.  Understanding the structure of pronouns and PGN markers and how they vary across the Kalahari Khoe languages is one of the central scientific goals of the project. The project will result in a dictionary, linguistically annotated recordings of texts, literacy resources, and a grammatical sketch, as well as disseminating results in journal articles. The project will also help to document the rich cultural heritage of Botswana, and southern Africa more generally.

This award supports developing methods, concepts, theory, algorithms and computer codes to understand the physical properties of strongly correlated materials in and out of equilibrium.  A long-term goal is to enhance predictive power to accelerate the process of material discovery and design utilizing strongly correlated materials. Simplified many-body Hamiltonians will be constructed and used to understand qualitative aspects of strong correlation phenomena at low energies with computationally intensive calculations that model more accurately the microscopic complexity of real materials. Computational methods include combining electronic structure and dynamical mean-field theory.  This project will continue the development and testing of this non-perturbative approach on materials of current experimental interest. <br/><br/>In materials proximate to the Mott transition, the physics is governed by charge blocking. The PI will explore the implications of strong correlations near a Mott transition in nonequilibrium steady states in the presence of dissipation and electric fields.   <br/><br/>In Hund's metals, the physics is governed by spin blocking while the charge fluctuates strongly.

By such control, better materials can be made for many different applications, from structural materials to catalysts to batteries, and to materials with high tolerance to radiation damage.  This program is examining a new approach to making these next-generation metals and metallic nanostructures, mixing inspiration from powder metallurgy and from an exotic materials processing technique called dealloying.  Dealloying occurs when one element of a solid metal is pulled out of the metal, leaving behind a nanoporous material.  The central hypothesis of this work, is that a powder mixture can be used to create dealloyed materials.  One powder component acts to absorb elements dealloyed from the other.  Because powders are being used, it is expected that bulk amounts of processed materials can be made easily and readily tested for different applications. Student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels will help develop the next generation of materials scientists trained in modern metallurgy.  Such training will be complemented by organizing and participating in international conferences on dealloying and related professional development.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Nanocomposite and nanoporous metals consisting of multiple interpenetrating but compositionally distinct solid and void phases hold promise for structural applications requiring high strength, high ductility, radiation tolerance, catalysis, sensing, supercapacitors, batteries, and as templates to make new nanocomposites via backfilling.  A technique to make such materials is dealloying - the selective dissolution of one component from a multi-component alloy.  This project explores the next-generation of dealloyed nanostructured materials, using a concept called powder-based dealloying.  Powder-based dealloying refers to the metallurgical phase evolution in the environment of mixed powders, where the composition of one powder is the material to be dealloyed, and the other powder, when melted, acts as the dealloying medium.  This involves analysis of the kinetics of dealloying in fixed volumes, and it is hypothesized that bulk samples of metals can be made that exhibit very fine microstructures with characteristic lengths less than 50 nm.  We are also taking the first steps to assess how dealloying can be integrated into powder metallurgical processing methods, and perhaps ultimately additive manufacturing. By examining a range of model materials made by powder-based dealloying, a database of basic physical kinetics behavior will be developed that will be applicable to many high-temperature processing technologies, from sintering to additive manufacturing, as well as more efficiently work with rare, hard-to-sustain, and refractory materials. Student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels will help develop the next generation of materials scientists trained in modern metallurgy.  Such training will be complemented by organizing and participating in international conferences on dealloying and related professional development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This can negatively impact health and lead to lower life expectancy. This project will equip communities to obtain and understand information on local air pollution and advocate for solutions to local, near-road air quality concerns. Student involvement will lead to an increase in participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. The team will achieve these goals by combining air quality measurements, modeling, and community engagement. If successful, the results of this research will transform air pollution exposure assessment modeling and highlight the potential for productive collaborations between researchers and community members to solve air quality problems.<br/><br/><br/>The central research question for this project is how accounting for spatial and temporal variation in air pollutant concentrations impacts exposure estimates for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations and active individuals. The primary hypothesis is that the proposed hybrid modeling approach will yield better estimates of air pollutant concentrations than each model individually. The central education question is whether combining undergraduate service learning projects and community engagement increases retention and recruitment of underrepresented students in engineering and empowers community members around local air pollution concerns. This project pursues the following aims to address these questions: (1) Create a dataset of extensive, detailed, and accessible modeled air pollution concentrations and exposures needed for community planning, advocacy, and empowerment. (2) Partner with neighborhood associations to create a robust local dataset of measured air pollutant concentrations in Hartford, CT. (3) Engage engineering students in service learning projects using local air pollution assessment projects. The coupling of computational modeling, low-cost monitoring, community engagement, and service learning will transform the way air pollution researchers and impacted communities interact. <br/><br/>This project moves beyond standard concentration estimates for exposure by addressing a large number of chemical species from all spatial scales. This project tests the effectiveness of high-resolution networks of low-cost (<$1000) air pollution monitors for use in model evaluation. This contribution is significant because it uses an unprecedented combination of model development, community engaged research (citizen science), and service learning and will transform how policy makers, environmental justice researchers, urban planners, and epidemiologists estimate human exposures to air pollution and develop solutions to local concerns in a project that highlights engineering as an agent for societal change. Community engagement during this project increases the impacted public's literacy in areas pertaining to environmental science and air pollution. This work positively impacts society by facilitating the development of more effective and equitable air pollution policies, providing improved estimates of concentrations and exposures for epidemiological studies, informing urban planning, educating and empowering local communities and individuals around environmental concerns, and increasing retention and recruitment of underrepresented students in engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many lakes, however, are now experiencing increased input of carbon and nutrients, warming temperatures, and declining ice cover, which may reduce water quality or cause blooms of potentially harmful algae. Specifically, many lakes across the United States are experiencing increased browning due to high loading of organic matter leached from land plants. Browning reduces water clarity and interferes with drinking water management practices. In addition, it can cause other changes that may lead to rapid long-term declines in water quality. This research will test the hypothesis that browning may reduce oxygen concentrations in lakes. Low oxygen can cause nutrient release from lake sediments that may increase algae blooms, leading to lake eutrophication. Understanding the effects of browning will increase knowledge of lake ecosystems, and improve forecasts of how lakes will change as their surrounding environments change.  This research will also train graduate and undergraduate students, and will lead to better public understanding of threats to lake water quality.<br/><br/>Ecological tipping points are of vital interest as anthropogenic activities rapidly transform natural ecosystems. Changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) represent one important potential driver of tipping points in aquatic ecosystems. This project will investigate whether increases in terrestrial DOM loading can push clear-water oligotrophic lakes beyond a critical tipping point by stimulating hypolimnetic anoxia and sediment DOM and phosphorus release, which may initiate a positive feedback loop of decreasing water clarity, stronger thermal stratification, and enhanced hypolimnetic anoxia. This feedback loop accelerates ecological change and ultimately may shift lake trophic status toward greener, mesotrophic to eutrophic as well as browner, dystrophic conditions. This project will extend a long-term data set of water quality variables sampled since the late 1980s in two lakes in or near the Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station, located in northeastern Pennsylvania. Complementing these long-term observations, experiments and modeling will be carried out to understand feedbacks associated with browning and enhancing understanding of broader patterns of change in inland water bodies. The project will support a regional lake monitoring network in Pennsylvania and closely interface with GLEON, the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These bacteria may even contribute to the formation of precipitation in clouds. Little is known about how and why bacteria acquired this ability, which in scientific terms is called ice nucleation activity. In this project, scientists will study the bacterium Lysinibacillus parviboronicapiens, which was recently isolated from precipitation and which secretes a yet unidentified molecule with ice nucleation activity. The scientists propose to identify the genes that are necessary to synthesize this molecule, to study where the bacterium typically lives, and how it benefits from ice nucleation activity. One of the long-term goals is to understand the detailed mechanism this molecule uses to nucleate ice. This knowledge could improve our ability to predict amount and frequency of precipitation or to influence weather increasing rainfall during droughts or preventing damaging hail storms. The educational outreach components of the project are three-fold: the science of ice nucleation will be disseminated and taught to Appalachian high school students to increase knowledge and stimulate interest of possible scientific opportunities in their future; under-represented undergraduate students will participate in research programs; and graduate students will receive advanced training on ice nucleation, be mentored throughout their graduate school career, and produce data that can be disseminated via scholarly publications. The project will be evaluated on its effectiveness to not only conduct the proposed research activities but its ability to train and disseminate information to the three target audiences.<br/><br/><br/>Pure water super-cools to approximately -40C before it freezes. Only in the presence of particles with ice nucleation activity (INA), called ice nuclei, can water freeze at warmer temperatures. Ice nuclei in clouds in non-tropical climates catalyze the freezing of water droplets that become precipitation. Circumstantial evidence points to biological ice nuclei as contributors to ice nucleation in clouds. Besides a single type of bacterial INA protein, little is known about biological INA molecules and about the evolution of INA and its role in the life cycle of organisms. Lysinibacillus parviboronicapiens (Lp) was recently identified as the first Gram-positive bacterium to have INA. Initial characterization of the INA of Lp revealed this activity to be heat-resistant, proteinase-resistant, secreted, and water-soluble. This project has the following objectives: 1. Identify and characterize the biosynthetic pathway of the Lp INA molecule and characterize the molecule itself, 2. Unravel the evolutionary history of the underlying biosynthetic pathway, 3. Determine the role of the molecule in the ecology of Lp. Accomplishing these objectives will provide new knowledge of how organisms can change the environment in which they live. Because of the hypothesized role of ice nucleation in atmospheric processes, this project may also improve our understanding of how bacteria influence amount and intensity of precipitation and, therefore, help elucidate the possible role of bacteria in influencing earth's climate.

When the two sets are in a one-to-one correspondence, then one may call the correspondence a reciprocity law. One deep example of a reciprocity law is that of Artin and Langlands, which is a vast generalization of Quadratic Reciprocity Law discovered by Gauss that is important for solving equations over the integers modulo a prime, and which is the genesis of the more general Langlands Program. While a general reciprocity law within the Langlands program is still far from properly formulated, even for objects over rational numbers, one can consider the ""Langlands Functoriality Principle,"" which is a consequence of Artin-Langlands reciprocity and is a conjecture that is currently at the core of Langlands program. This project deals with both reciprocity and functoriality and will establish new techniques and tools to study them.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will compare the Fourier transform defined by Braverman-Kazhdan and the Hankel transform defined by Ngo, for the standard L-functions for classical groups. In the long run this will lead to a full theory of L-functions for cusp forms on any reductive group and any irreducible representation of its L-group. This will not only lead to fairly general cases of functoriality through converse theorems, but will also provide suitable Poisson summation formulas that are needed in the Beyond Endoscopy approach to functoriality. In terms of reciprocity, a number of cases where the equality of Artin factors with the factors defined by the Langlands-Shahidi method through the local Langlands correspondence (local reciprocity) for GL(n) will be established, following the techniques used in the cases of exterior and symmetric square factors for GL(n) proved earlier.

The geologic data mainly consist of dated glacial deposits that are preserved above the level of the present ice sheet, and range in age from thousands to millions of years old. These provide information about the size, thickness, and rate of change of the ice sheets during past times when the ice sheets were larger than present. In addition, some of these data are from below the present ice surface and therefore also provide some information about past warm periods when ice sheets were most likely smaller than present. The primary purpose of the computer model is to predict future ice sheet changes, but because significant changes in the size of ice sheets are slow and likely occur over hundreds of years or longer, the only way to determine whether these models are accurate is to test their ability to reproduce past ice sheet changes. The primary purpose of this project is to carry out such a test. The research team will compile relevant geologic data, in some cases generate new data by dating additional deposits, and develop methods and software to compare data to model simulations. In addition, this project will (i) contribute to building and sustaining U.S. science capacity through postdoctoral training in geochronology, ice sheet modeling, and data science, and (ii) improve public access to geologic data and model simulations relevant to ice sheet change through online database and website development. <br/><br/>Technical aspects of this project are primarily focused on the field of cosmogenic-nuclide exposure-dating, which is a method that relies on the production of rare stable and radio-nuclides by cosmic-ray interactions with rocks and minerals exposed at the Earth's surface. Because the advance and retreat of ice sheets results in alternating cosmic-ray exposure and shielding of underlying bedrock and surficial deposits, this technique is commonly used to date and reconstruct past ice sheet changes. First, this project will contribute to compiling and systematizing a large amount of cosmogenic-nuclide exposure age data collected in Antarctica during the past three decades. Second, it will generate additional geochemical data needed to improve the extent and usefulness of measurements of stable cosmogenic nuclides, cosmogenic neon-21 in particular, that are useful for constraining ice-sheet behavior on million-year timescales. Third, it will develop a computational framework for comparison of the geologic data set with existing numerical model simulations of Antarctic ice sheet change during the past several million years, with particular emphasis on model simulations of past warm periods, for example the middle Pliocene ca. 3-3.3 million years ago, during which the Antarctic ice sheets are hypothesized to have been substantially smaller than present. Fourth, guided by the results of this comparison, it will generate new model simulations aimed at improving agreement between model simulations and geologic data, as well as diagnosing which processes or parameterizations in the models are or are not well constrained by the data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing detection methods based on machine learning and blacklists are both brittle to new attacks and somewhat lenient, in order to avoid blocking legitimate messages; as a result, widely used email systems are vulnerable to carefully crafted phishing emails. To address this, the project team will develop systems that automatically block obvious scams while forwarding less certain cases to groups of crowd workers trained to detect phishing mails. To support these workers' decision-making, the team will develop novel explanations of the system's decision making that will highlight the aspects of both the message and its algorithm that triggered the need for human judgment. The system will also aggregate these crowd decisions to generate real-time phishing alerts that can be shared to both individual users and to email systems. The project will lead to advances in interpretable machine learning, an important topic given the increasing role that artificial intelligence and machine learning systems play in society, and also increase our ability to characterize the evolution of phishing attacks and the vulnerability of internet platforms and users to those attacks over time. The project team will also use the work as an important component of new courses on usable security and outreach programs to high school teachers and students to both educate them about and increase their participation in cybersecurity research.<br/><br/>The work is organized around three main objectives: empirical characterization of phishing risks, developing accurate and interpretable machine learning models for phishing detection, and developing reliable crowdsourcing systems for phishing alerts. The team will assess phishing risks through developing analytics tools on the effective adoption and configuration of anti-spoofing protocols in email systems, using adversarial machine learning methods to conduct black box testing on existing phishing detectors, and creating reactive honeypots that entice and respond to phishing attacks in order to collect data on not just the initial phishing emails but on attackers' behaviors throughout the course of a successful phishing attack. The data collected on phishing emails will be used to develop the machine learning models, using Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory based deep learning techniques to generate both suspicious features and confidence estimates of individual decisions. The suspicious features will be used to generate interpretable security cues such as text annotations or icons by first creating simpler and more interpretable machine learning models such as decision trees that mimic the local detection boundary near the target emails in the feature space. Rules in the decision tree will be mapped back to interface elements and email content to provide the warnings, and these will be compared to generic email security warnings in a series of user studies that also model people's ability to detect phishing using a variety of cues, features, and media. Those individual models, along with the confidence estimates from the phishing detection model, will then be used to drive a crowdsourcing-based system where the models of individual users' quality will be aggregated to make reliable judgments around emails the models judge as too suspicious to pass but not suspicious enough to automatically filter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genome-wide proteomics studies provide a growing list of putative protein-protein interactions, and demonstrate that most if not all proteins have interacting partners in the cell. However, these techniques can only identify whether two proteins possibly interact. A full comprehension of how proteins bind and form complexes can only come from high-resolution three-dimensional structures, since they provide the atomic details necessary to understand how the interactions occur and how the high degree of specificity can be achieved.  While the most complete structural characterization is provided by X-ray crystallography, many biologically important interactions occur in weak, transient complexes that are not amenable to direct experimental analysis, even when both proteins can be isolated and their structures determined. The goal of this project is to further improve the protein-protein docking server ClusPro that, starting from the structures of component proteins, attempts to determine the structure of their complexes with accuracy close to that provided by X-ray crystallography. The server at https://cluspro.org  already has close to 10,000 registered users, although it can also be used without registration. Docked structures generated by ClusPro have been reported in over 600 research papers. The public server is important for biological and chemical scientists who may not have extensive computational experience but still will be able to use state of the art docking methods. The increased availability of protein complex structures will have major impact in many areas of biology, biochemistry, and biotechnology. <br/><br/>The project has six aims focusing on problems of increasing difficulty. First, a new opportunity to progress is provided by earlier development of the manifold fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation algorithm, which increased the speed of sampling by orders of magnitude. An additional advantage of the method is that increasing the number of correlation function terms is computationally inexpensive. Therefore, Aim 1 is the development and implementation of complex energy functions, including distance-dependent and three-body potentials for scoring. Second, recently developed methods have shown considerable promise in predicting contacts between residues in proteins using evolutionary covariance information. The problem is that these methods require large numbers of evolutionarily related sequences of interacting proteins to robustly assess the extent of residue covariation. Aim 2 is exploring how sequence information can be used for extracting inter-protein contacts to improve docking results even with somewhat limited number of sequences. Third, with the increase in the number of protein complex structures, there is increasing need for integrating direct docking and template-based prediction methods, and several strategies will be explored to implement such integration. Fourth, the docking method will be modified to work optimally with homology models rather than X-ray structures of interacting proteins. The fifth aim is exploring new approaches to the docking of proteins with substantial backbone conformational changes upon binding. The sixth and final aim is implementing the newly developed algorithms in the ClusPro server.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many speech separation algorithms perform reasonably well when they are tested in simulated environments, but this level of performance does not always carry over to real environments that are more nuanced. For example, a common complaint of many hearing aid users is that their hearing aid is not effective in noisy environments such as restaurants. Current computational measures do not enable practical or convenient speech assessment in everyday environments, and this is a major hurdle for improving real-world separation performance. In addition, the end-user has largely been left out of the development and evaluation process, which is not ideal since an approach's usefulness is ultimately determined by people. The objective of this project is to develop computational evaluation algorithms to better assess speech quality and intelligibility in real environments. <br/><br/>A key area of research focuses on developing novel, data-driven assessment algorithms that use deep learning to predict human assessment scores, which enables testing in real environments.  Considering the recent success that deep learning has had in speech processing, this new assessment approach is promising and offers substantial differences from prior approaches. The relationship between spectral-temporal speech attributes and human assessment scores are determined as a result of this project. Quantifying this relationship ensures that assessment algorithms are accurate and have strong agreement with human evaluations. An effective integration of human assessment in speech separation algorithm development should result in improved separation algorithms, which ultimately benefits users and applications. This is expected since accurate assessment enables researchers to more easily identify and correct weaknesses based on real-world environmental factors. The research activities lay the foundation for the emerging research area of improving realism in speech processing applications and offer key insights on human perception to the larger scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference will bring together researchers working on the interplay between three and four dimensional topology to share state of the art knowledge, hear talks from a select group of internationally renowned experts, and develop new collaborations. This grant will support travel expenses for graduate students, early career researchers and speakers.<br/><br/>There is a fundamental nexus of problems, including the smooth 4-dimensional Schonflies and Poincare conjectures and their connection to decompositions of 3-manifolds, which is deeply rooted in and has long motivated the work of Abby Thompson (working mostly in dimension 3), Marty Scharlemann (working in 3.5-dimensional topology), and Rob Kirby (working mostly in dimension 4). This conference uses the collective legacy of these researchers as an organizing theme with the goal of reinvigorating work on these foundational problems, reminding the community of the power of their tools, and showcasing recent topological advances in the spirit of their work.

One of the biggest unknowns about past climate is the origin of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) variability over global warm-cold cycles. This project will address potential causes of the varying atmospheric carbon dioxide by focusing on changes in the efficiency of fertilization of the surface ocean, and how, and if, that is related to changes in the deep-ocean. Furthermore, the research will investigate both the ""how"" of varying carbon dioxide with the ""where"", namely the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP), an important region of the world ocean where, today, significant CO2 is exhaled to the atmosphere and the greatest rates of phytoplankton growth are found. The project will contribute to an improved understanding of global climate change and important Earth systems connected to the tropical Pacific Ocean. On the broadest of levels, understanding the past dynamics of Earth's carbon cycle is of fundamental importance to inform and guide societal policy-making in an increasing CO2 world. The project will support the educational and professional development of graduate and undergraduate students and results will be incorporated into the curriculum of undergraduate and graduate classes. In addition, a series of YouTube videos will be developed that are aimed at communicating the importance of how past climate variability informs us about climate's future variability and its potential impact on our lives.<br/><br/>The project seeks to answer questions related to: 1) where and how atmospheric carbon dioxide was sequestered from the atmosphere, or ventilated from the ocean, on millennial timescales, and 2) how these carbon dynamics are related to both changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation over the last glacial period and into the deglacial and Holocene. To address these objectives, an integrated suite of multiple proxies will be measured in two high accumulation rate sediment cores previously collected from the EEP. These proxies include: authigenic uranium as a proxy for bottom water oxygenation and radiocarbon ages of benthic foraminifera as a proxy for changes in the age of deep water in the EEP, 231Pa/230Th ratios and excess Ba fluxes as proxies for productivity, excess 230Th-derived 232Th flux as a proxy for dust flux, B/Ca ratios in planktonic foraminifera as a proxy for carbonate ion concentration of surface water, and Nd and Pb isotope ratios as a proxy for the provenance of the dust source of the detrital component of the sediment and, therefore, an index of Intertropical Convergence Zone migration. By investigating the storage of a respired carbon pool in the deep ocean during cold periods of the last glacial period (i.e., from ~71,000 to 14,000 years ago), in conjunction with probing how this storage relates to changes in export production and potential iron fertilization, the research will shed light on the mechanistic links between ocean (stratification/ventilation) and atmospheric (wind belt shifts) circulation and the modification of atmospheric CO2 levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this end, one considers the collection of all solutions of a system of equations as a geometric object and investigates the functions defined on this object. Reversing the perspective leads to the implicitization problem, which the investigator plans to work on: Given a geometric object, such as a curve or a surface, one wishes to construct a system of polynomial equations that has the geometric object as its solution set. Once the system of polynomial equations is known, it becomes much easier, for instance, to decide whether a specific point lies on the surface or whether the surface is smooth at one of its points. The implicitization problem is difficult and requires advanced techniques from pure mathematics, but its solution even in particular cases has numerous applications, for instance in computer aided design, robotics, and other areas of engineering.<br/>	<br/><br/>This project addresses several topics in Commutative Algebra that have close connections with Algebraic and Analytic Geometry and with Elimination Theory. They include the implicitization problem for Rees algebras and rational maps, equisingularity theory, the Poincare problem for plane foliations, and residual intersection theory. Determining the implicit equations of graphs and images of rational maps is a classical, but open problem in elimination theory, which amounts to finding defining ideals of Rees algebras. Previously, the PI and his collaborators solved this problem for Rees algebras of codimension three Gorenstein ideals, under the additional assumption that the entries of a syzygy matrix of the ideal generate a complete intersection. Now the PI intends to remove this crucial hypothesis. The PI also plans to investigate Rees algebras of more general ideals, with the aim to obtain at least qualitative statements and bounds for the implicit equations. A goal in equisingularity theory is to devise fiberwise numerical criteria for when a family of analytic spaces is topologically trivial. An important intermediate step are numerical characterizations of integral dependence of modules. The PI intends to prove such a characterization using a notion of multiplicity that is inspired by intersection theory. Poincare had asked how to decide whether a singular algebraic foliation of the complex plane has an algebraic curve as a leaf. In more recent times, this question has often been treated as a problem about relating invariants of a vector field to invariants of curves or varieties that are left invariant by the vector field. The PI will investigate this problem, using his expertise from prior work on algebraic differentials and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. The notion of residual intersection, a generalization of linkage or liaison, is ubiquitous and appears naturally in intersection theory and in the study of Rees algebras, for instance. Of central importance are the Cohen-Macaulayness and duality properties of residual intersections. Based on partial results and experimental evidence, David Eisenbud and the PI have observed that, unexpectedly, many residual intersections, even when they fail to be Cohen-Macaulay, admit maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules of rank one that are self-dual. The PI and his collaborators intend to give a proof of this unusual phenomenon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How continents break apart by rifting processes is thought to be predefined by inherent structural and compositional variability of Earth's crust and mantle that make up the lithosphere and is likely inherited from previous tectonic events. Understanding the style of continental breakup provides fundamental information for the exploration for energy and mineral resources and to understanding the geologic hazards associated with these processes. Geological observations often support the fact that these inheritances are key parameters in the development of rift structures but the extent to which these inheritances play a role during the rifting process remain unclear. This project investigates how the variable composition of continental lithosphere and the presence of inherited geological structures affect rifting processes. A multi-disciplinary approach will employ geological and geophysical observations to characterize inheritances in the crust and mantle of the lithosphere. These observations will be integrated into numerical models that simulate the deformation of the lithosphere over millions of years by extension.  The results of this project will fundamentally advance the understanding of lithospheric scale deformation processes and impact structural geology, computational geosciences and potentially the fossil fuel communities. Under broader impacts the project supports an early career female researcher at Texas State University, a primarily Hispanic-serving institution, and a master student will be recruited to participate directly in the research.<br/><br/>Passive margins define about half of the Earth's coastlines and have been the focus of numerous studies in recent decades. While understanding of rifting processes has greatly improved, fundamental questions remain on the effects of inherited conditions on localization processes in extending lithosphere. Multiple studies suggest that structural, compositional and thermal inheritances are key parameters in the development of rift structures. However, the extent to which they play a role during breakup is still unclear. This project will address the hypothesis that inheritances strongly affect rifting processes and can explain: 1) the distribution of strain during the initial phase of deformation, 2) the mechanism of thinning during the rifting process, and 3) the mechanism leading to the exhumation and/or the formation of oceanic crust. To test this hypothesis numerical rifting experiments will be run with both structural and compositional inheritances. Inheritances are parameterized as oriented fabrics obtained from 2D seismic and 3D structural observations. A polymineralic composition is assigned to these heterogeneities in order to account for the natural variation in compositions observed in the continental lithosphere. In order to constrain the models, a multidisciplinary approach will be used that combines: 1) the analysis of geological and geophysical data, 2) a systematic exploration of the effects of numerical modeling experiments using a bimineralic rheology, and 3) a case study of the Northeastern Canadian margin with 2D and 3D numerical models. This approach will allow for a large amount of quantitative information on rift evolution to be acquired by independently varying the composition, distribution and orientation of inheritances. Results will help improve understanding of strain distribution, localization processes and mechanisms of deformation during continental breakup, and visualize the dynamic evolution of rifting processes depending on the type of inheritances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Von Neumann algebras have since become a field of independent interest with further applications to areas such as ergodic theory, Voiculescu's free probability theory, Jones' theory of subfactors and planar algebras, knot theory, and many others. The development of von Neumann algebras has also historically been closely connected to the study of measurable dynamics and these connections have recently begun to reemerge in the presence of newly developed rigidity phenomenon. The investigation of this rigidity phenomenon has since led to new connections between von Neumann algebras and other areas of mathematics. Furthering the development of rigidity will in turn lead to new insights and connections among these various fields.<br/><br/>Developing alongside the theory of von Neumann algebras has been ergodic theory, and many results in one field has had major applications in the other. A reemergence of this collaboration has occurred in the last ten years with Popa's discovery of deformation/rigidity theory, which juxtaposes deformability properties such as Haagerup's property, free products, or unbounded cocycles, with rigidity properties such as property (T) or spectral gap, allowing one to discover hidden structure in a von Neumann algebra in the case when both types of phenomena occur. This project will investigate more fully these connections, focusing specifically on connections to the deep rigidity theory for ergodic actions of lattices in higher rank groups initiated by Mostow, Margulis, Zimmer, and many others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These proteins have different functions. Thus, the number and type of proteins produced from a gene, i.e., gene regulation, are important aspects of how an organism functions. The investigators will look across the whole genome in natural populations of the fruit fly that have adapted to different temperature environments. By comparing gene regulation among these populations, they will learn how gene regulation changes as organisms adapt to their environment. The project will provide an unusually complete view of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of the evolution of gene regulation. It will also inform how insects adapt to novel environments. Thus, they will also learn about the factors that limit the geographic ranges of insects that are agricultural pests or disease vectors.  Broader impacts of this project include extensive training of young scientists, including members of underrepresented groups in science. The project will also strengthen scientific connections between U.S. researchers and their counterparts in Africa. Finally, the team will improve the quality of scientific reference material available to the public online.<br/><br/>The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster originated from warm regions of Africa; this research focuses on three parallel instances of adaptation to colder climates.  The project includes the collection of RNA sequence data from three pairs of warm- and cold-adapted populations that encompass these three climate transitions.  By applying a population genetic framework to this data set, population differences in gene expression and alternative splicing that were most likely driven by local adaptation can be identified.  Crosses between warm- and cold-adapted populations will allow these changes to be classified as either cis-encoded at the affected gene, or trans-encoded by another gene.  For cis-encoded cases of adaptive expression or splicing evolution, patterns of genetic variation can illuminate key details of natural selection's mode of action. Researchers will use existing population genomic data to test whether selection favored new mutations or standing genetic variation.  The project also entails the genetic mapping of cold tolerance differences for each population pair.  The combination of mapping results, population genomic analysis of existing data, and the above RNA sequencing results will identify notable candidate genes for local adaptation via cis-acting changes in gene regulation.  Probing the interface between genetic adaptation and the thermal environment will test whether gene regulatory changes alter or maintain ancestral regulation, and whether such changes result in gene regulatory networks that are less buffered against perturbation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many lakes, however, are now experiencing increased input of carbon and nutrients, warming temperatures, and declining ice cover, which may reduce water quality or cause blooms of potentially harmful algae. Specifically, many lakes across the United States are experiencing increased browning due to high loading of organic matter leached from land plants. Browning reduces water clarity and interferes with drinking water management practices. In addition, it can cause other changes that may lead to rapid long-term declines in water quality. This research will test the hypothesis that browning may reduce oxygen concentrations in lakes. Low oxygen can cause nutrient release from lake sediments that may increase algae blooms, leading to lake eutrophication. Understanding the effects of browning will increase knowledge of lake ecosystems, and improve forecasts of how lakes will change as their surrounding environments change.  This research will also train graduate and undergraduate students, and will lead to better public understanding of threats to lake water quality.<br/><br/>Ecological tipping points are of vital interest as anthropogenic activities rapidly transform natural ecosystems. Changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) represent one important potential driver of tipping points in aquatic ecosystems. This project will investigate whether increases in terrestrial DOM loading can push clear-water oligotrophic lakes beyond a critical tipping point by stimulating hypolimnetic anoxia and sediment DOM and phosphorus release, which may initiate a positive feedback loop of decreasing water clarity, stronger thermal stratification, and enhanced hypolimnetic anoxia. This feedback loop accelerates ecological change and ultimately may shift lake trophic status toward greener, mesotrophic to eutrophic as well as browner, dystrophic conditions. This project will extend a long-term data set of water quality variables sampled since the late 1980s in two lakes in or near the Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station, located in northeastern Pennsylvania. Complementing these long-term observations, experiments and modeling will be carried out to understand feedbacks associated with browning and enhancing understanding of broader patterns of change in inland water bodies.

This project involves partial differential equations, geometric function theory, calculus of variations and related problems that arise in real-world applications including: nonlinear elasticity, microstructure of materials, and crystals to name a few. The proposed physical interpretations of mathematical objects, like Sobolev homeomorphisms that are viewed as elastic deformations, have proven useful in understanding and solving challenging problems in nonlinear elasticity. The primary aim here is to develop new, and improve old, methods to meet these challenges. The new mathematical concepts such as free Lagrangians allow one to establish the existence of traction free energy-minimal deformations. Further advances in Hopf-Laplace differentials could lead to predictions of the formation of cracks in deformations, and in understanding the principle of interpenetration of matter. Theoretical prediction of failure of elastic bodies caused by cracks would have a broad impact to both mathematical analysts and researchers in the engineering fields. The research topics in this project, although in general mathematically challenging, also take on questions that are suitable for graduate students. The ultimate goal is to attract graduate students and young scholars, both women and men, to geometric function theory with a wide range of applications, to encourage them to participate in the interdisciplinary efforts, and to prepare and help them to develop meaningful interactions with physicists and engineers. The principal investigator is currently working with Jani Onninen on a joint monograph designed for researchers as well as graduate students in geometric function theory.<br/><br/>The principal investigator has a history of strong efforts to gain from an interplay between pure and applied mathematics. It resulted in the solution of several mathematical problems such as the Nitsche conjecture in the theory of minimal surfaces, the Evans-Ball conjecture on approximation of Sobolev mappings with diffeomorphisms, the novel concept of free Lagrangians in the calculus of variations, formation of cracks along trajectories of Hopf differentials, rigorous description of the phenomenon of interpenetration of matter, and the partial answers in the dimension two to the legendary Morrey's conjecture on quasiconvexity of the rank-one convex functionals; in particular, sharp inequalities of Burkholder's stochastic integrals. The latter include the complex Beurling-Ahlfors singular integral transform. The eminence of this transform lies in the fact that it connects two homotopy classes of the first order elliptic systems in the complex plane: one whose solutions are orientation preserving mapping and the other with orientation reversing solutions. The notoriously difficult problem has been to identify the Lp-norm of the Beurling-Ahlfos transform.

The expanded program aims to teach transferable skills that meet workforce needs in non-petroleum industries in the region.<br/><br/>The project will enhance the academic quality of the current automation and control program.   In response to industry demand, the new automation and control program will incorporate information technology skills such as networking and programming.  In addition, it will offer industry certifications such as the National Institute for Metalworking Skills-based Industrial Technology Maintenance certification and the Cisco Interconnecting Networking Device certification. The project expands on infrastructure developed and best practices learned as a recipient of a Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training grant from the Department of Labor.   The project will expand technical knowledge in the region as students offer new skills and expertise to their employers and to peer networks. Students who learn transferable automation and control skills that incorporate the nationally recognized National Institution of Metalworking Skills certification will have improved career options, in the region and beyond. In addition, the regional economy can benefit by having a workforce that can apply automation and control skills in diverse industries. Newly hired technicians who have industry-needed skills can be immediately productive, contributing to increasing technical knowledge and application in the region.

Professor Winter seeks to understand the structure-reactivity principles for photochemical reactions, with the long-term goal of developing a predictive theoretical model that relates chemical structure to reactivity. The research focuses on why certain types of structures break apart to form ions.  The research uses a combination of theory and experiment. Photochemical reactions have broad applications in biology and environmental chemistry. Establishing the basic mechanisms for fundamental bond breaking contributes to the broader challenge of understanding the guiding principles in photochemical reactions.  Professor Winter engages college freshman in an early multidisciplinary research experiences through the Freshman Research Initiative. This research provides research opportunities for undergraduates and students from under-represented groups.  <br/><br/>To study photoheterolysis reactions, Professor Winter uses a joint theoretical/experimental approach. High-level computational methods are used to map excited state transition states and surface crossing topologies in selected reactions which are known to proceed by heterolysis. Ultrafast femtosecond-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy is used to determine the rates and mechanisms of photoheterolysis reactions on model substrates, while high-level excited state calculations are designed to provide a mechanistic rationale.   This combination of theory and experiment determines the effect of structure on the rates and mechanisms of photorelease in model systems.  The Professor Winter leads a Freshman Research Initiative at ISU that engages freshmen in an early multidisciplinary research program. He also continues his Chats with Eminent Female Scientists (ChEFS) Initiative, involving online video interviews with successful academics, providing insights and advice for students interested in an academic career.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A singularity is a place on a curve, surface, or higher dimensional space where it is not smooth, that is, it has a cusp (a sharp point, a place where it folds or turns abruptly) or it crosses itself. The understanding of singularities has applications to computer vision and medical imaging. In general, one wants to find and study measures of how extreme a singularity is and how these vary under operations such as deformations. This is done using abstract algebraic techniques as usually the dimension, or the number of equations, or variable and unknown coefficients make the spaces completely impractical to visualize. The goal is to attach invariants to singularities that are measures of the nature of the singularity. This project studies such invariants in three different ways. <br/><br/>More precisely, this project involves the study of the exterior algebra, modules of higher differentials, exterior powers of complexes, and related power operations such as Adams operations, sometimes with differential graded algebra structures playing a role. The homological behavior of exterior power operations is known to be complicated, yet these algebras and operations play a central role throughout many parts of algebra and mathematics. This project focuses on the following research directions (1) Adams operations and applications to Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities, (2) invariants of singularities for p-differentials, and (3) resolutions of graded Artinian algebras. For the first, the main goal is to develop a characteristic zero version of Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity. For the second, the focus is on studying singularities via their modules of higher differentials; the goal is to understand symmetries and the vanishing of invariants obtained from them, such as generalized Tjurina numbers, by showing how their resolutions are interrelated in the general non-isolated Gorenstein singularity setting. The third involves applying the resolution of Artinian algebras to various problems, such as conjectures on Betti numbers and finding dg-structures on resolutions in order to further understand Koszul homology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, random matrix techniques have improved our theoretical understanding of numerical analysis and deep learning networks. <br/><br/>Methods from probability (random walks and coupling), analysis (homogenization) and mathematical physics (loop equations) were recently advanced in connection with spectral analysis of random matrices, to prove eigenvalues and eigenvectors universality.

In this type of failure, small metallic lines used to conduct electricity (so-called interconnects) develop microscopic voids and ultimately break due to a large amount of electrical current, leading to the overall failure of the electronic device. It is known that electromigration is controlled by the structure of the metallic material, in particular how its atoms are arranged. In typical metals, certain regions (called grain boundaries) display large levels of disorder in the atomic arrangement, and this is known to facilitate failure by electromigration. In this project, new kinds of nanoscale metallic materials with well-ordered atomic structures (so-called twin boundaries), and thus a high potential to prevent electromigration, will be studied. Electromigration is a barrier for the progress of the electronic industry, hampering further miniaturization and greater reliability. In the case of the new wearable and flexible electronic technologies, it limits broader mass-market applications. The understanding of electromigration in metals with twin boundaries emerging from this research will contribute to remove these difficulties, and enable new directions in the design of interconnects. Furthermore, mentoring and research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students will be enabled by this grant. The graduate students will engage in mentoring of undergraduates participating in the project, and of high-school students hosted in the PI lab through the Nanoexplorers program at UTD. By doing meaningful research related to this project, the high school students will be inspired to pursue careers in STEM. <br/><br/>Technical summary: <br/>Electromigration is a diffusion process where electrons travelling in a conductor in a high-current-density scenario- promote the diffusion of atoms in the metallic lattice, leading to voids and eventually failure. Diffusion depends on the microstructure; in fact, grain boundaries are known to facilitate electromigration due to their loosely-packed structure. Twin boundaries, on the other hand, promise to slow diffusion by several orders of magnitude due to their ordered atomic structure. The proposed research aims to investigate the potentially-beneficial role of materials with well-defined and repeatable twin boundaries, as interconnects with increased resistance to electromigration. The proposed research program is experimental in nature, and aims to gain insights into the electromigration behavior of twinned interconnects by conducting tests where high current densities and controlled temperatures will cause failure. A combination of high-throughput ex-situ electrical tests for statistically-significant quantification of failure, and in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tests to understand the evolution of the twinned microstructure during electromigration, will be conducted. The objectives of the research are: i) To quantify the electromigration parameters in twinned interconnects; ii) To characterize in-situ TEM the electromigration behavior to obtain structure-property relations; and iii) to compare the electromigration performance of twinned interconnects with respect to published data from interconnects currently used in the electronic industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More recently, vision scientists have determined that the retina routes the cone signals into three ""cardinal color"" pathways: red vs. green (RG), bluish vs. yellowish (BY), and black vs. white (BW). However, the manner in which light is turned into colored perceptions is not fully understood - in particular, how do people perceive colors beyond the six cardinal colors, the ""non-cardinal"" colors? To investigate this, the researchers will test how different spatial characteristics of the stimuli (e.g., size, striping, contrast) affects the ability to perceive non-cardinal colors. The results may allow vision scientists to understand more about the neural mechanisms behind color perception. In addition, this project will provide research internships for undergraduate college students, the next generation of scientists, as part of NSF's mission to promote the progress of science.  <br/><br/>This project will use visual psychophysics to test the neural mechanisms underlying our ability to perceive non-cardinal colors.  Although there is ample evidence that such mechanisms exist in the isoluminant plane of color space, there is less strong evidence for the two planes with luminance input (red-green/luminance and tritan/luminance).  Thus, these latter two planes are a focus of the proposed studies.  Non-cardinal mechanisms will be measured by the ratio of the contrast thresholds to detect the stimuli when embedded in aligned noise (same color) versus when embedded in orthogonal noise (e.g., red/green stimuli embedded in tritan noise).  Stimulus attributes such as size, contrast, and gratings vs. full-field will be manipulated.

Prominent advances in polymer chemistry over the last several decades have ushered in the ability to design a variety of molecular architectures with a high degree of control and functional versatility. The development of new molecular architectures that synergize the features of advanced functionality and enhanced elasticity is the primary objective of this research. The proposed work is hypothesized to produce ultra-flexible materials and super-soft gels that are potentially superior and could have applications as lubricants, articular cartilage (knee or joint) replacements, and protective equipment that reduces force impact.  A new class of architectures of polymer molecules having bottlebrush-network shapes will be designed and explored, which is expected to lead to special super-elastic properties. This research will be integrated with broader impacts of education for undergraduates, graduates, and the local community.  It will contribute to nurturing the growing research in polymer science at FSU and the nation.  A three-point plan focuses on curriculum development, collaborative events, and community outreach directed towards underrepresented groups in polymer science.  Education about plastics, their challenges, and their opportunities to solve societal needs for future generations will be undertaken and integrated with the proposed research. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>	<br/>The design of bottlebrush (BB) systems for frontier materials applications places emphasis on the degree of polymerization of the backbone and the side chains in addition to graft density. Although these coarse dials serve as a means to begin understanding of these unique architectures, there are other synthetic components which may present a means potentially to discover new properties. A majority of BB systems are derived from the polymerization of either a vinyl monomer or norbornene to produce a variety of graft chemistries affixed to a highly limited number of backbone options. This work proposes to expand the suite of backbone chemistries possible through the use of precise polypentenamer scaffolds suited to produce BB systems through a ""grafting-from"" approach. These materials will produce a graft at exactly every fifth carbon (similar to polynorbornenes) but with a flexible rubber-like backbone chemistry between each graft site. It is hypothesized that the reduced Kuhn length associated with this flexible backbone will result in amplified sensitivity as the size of the grafts increase and begin to occupy the pervaded volume around it. Such dynamic behavior will be fully studied through light scattering and viscoelastic measurements as a function of the synthetic design principles that elucidate variances in the aforementioned coarse dials for BB systems. The results will be corroborated with developing theoretical and computational treatments for BB systems. Given the rubber-like backbone, a natural extension for such systems towards superelastic and supersoft networks will be explored to provide potentially transformative materials for use in lubrication and impact dampening. <br/><br/>A three-point plan will be implemented to increase the education in polymer science at FSU and the surrounding community through enhanced curriculum, collaborative events, and outreach. Undergraduates will be offered an advanced elective in polymer synthesis. Research focused around polymer science will be highlighted with an FSU annual poster session. Finally, continued efforts to reach out to the surrounding community through a plastics education exhibit will bring to light societal aspects that involve polymer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The exotic quasiparticles-Dirac fermions, hosted by these two-dimensional materials provide a new testbed for electron motion because of their chiral nature and negative energy states. The PI recently developed a versatile technique to create pristine nanoscale PN junctions with arbitrary shapes, which enabled the first imaging of confined Dirac fermions. This project investigates the role of the potential shape and the differences in behavior between massless and massive Dirac fermions within these confinement potentials. Because Dirac fermions exhibit Klein tunneling (100% barrier transmission) and anti-Klein tunneling (100% barrier reflection), the research carried out by this project reveals novel bound states not found with Schrdinger fermions. Moreover, steered Dirac fermion trajectories across and in response to PN and graphene/superconductor junctions are mapped and compared directly to microscopic models for barrier transmission and superconductivity. Theoretical predictions for the behavior of Dirac fermions at these interfaces are abundant, but it has not been possible to directly test them - until now. Specifically, to reveal chiral bound states and trajectories this CAREER project contains three main research efforts: (1) Visualize and control chiral bound states in two-dimensional material heterostructures composed of graphene and bilayer graphene. This study creates pristine nanoscale PN junctions in two-dimensional material heterostructures and use scanning tunneling microscopy to map quantum interference and confinement within these PN junctions. Different junction shapes (circular vs. non-circular) and charge carrier types (massless vs. massive Dirac fermions) are investigated; (2) Visualize and control ballistic chiral electron trajectories in two-dimensional material heterostructures. This study uses scanning gate microscopy in conjunction with nanoscale PN junctions and magnetic fields to map and steer ballistic trajectories of massless and massive Dirac fermions; (3) visualize and control chiral trajectories at a graphene/superconductor interface. This study uses scanning gate microscopy to map Dirac fermion reflections off a superconductor's interface at the nanoscale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many studies over time indicate that when K-12 students have the opportunity to study engineering, their engagement in and understanding of math and science increases. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) teachers want and are required by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to incorporate engineering concepts and capabilities into their curriculum, regardless of the subjects they teach. Yet, only a fraction have completed engineering coursework. The challenge, then, is to expose STEM teachers to engineering research and its potential applications and provide a process for infusing their curriculum with innovative engineering and design concepts and practices. Stanford's new Teaching Engineering Design & Innovation (TEDI) program addresses this challenge head on. TEDI will expose 38 teachers and 10,000 students from school districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to the ways science and math content knowledge and Design Thinking (DT) provide solutions to difficult engineering design challenges. TEDI's primary goal is to promote interest in engineering and proficiency in STEM among Bay Area high school students by having teachers practice engineering and use DT to create innovative and exciting curriculum for their students. The major elements of the TEDI model include 8-week teacher placements into Stanford engineering research laboratories; weekly workshops exposing them to a range of engineering disciplines and DT exercises; paid industry placements for teachers before or after a summer at Stanford; and assistance in developing and disseminating new curriculum for use with their own students and others. At a time when over 60% of all California K-12 students are Hispanic, African American, Native American or Pacific Islander groups historically under-represented in STEM and 62% are eligible for free and reduced-price meals, TEDI educates and supports diverse students from some of California's most under-resourced schools to enter and thrive in the STEM pipeline, becoming the scientific and technical workforce of tomorrow and contributing to our nation's economy and global competitiveness.<br/><br/>The RET Site: Teaching Engineering Design & Innovation (TEDI) creates enduring partnerships between San Francisco Bay Area high school STEM teachers, Stanford faculty and graduate students, and industry to focus on critical engineering and design skills that drive U.S. innovation and global competitiveness.

These microbial communities, or microbiomes, are made up of hundreds of species of bacteria, but which species are present, and how common they are, varies from individual to individual animal. This variability is important because abnormal communities can lead to conditions that range from obesity to depression. However, the rules by which microbial communities come together or breakdown are poorly understood. Using wild bats as models, the researchers will investigate how host sociality, diet, genetics, and microbe functions and interactions shape the make-up of digestive microbiomes.  The results of this research to understand the rules governing microbiome composition can help advance human and wildlife health. To improve students' understanding of how scientific research is conducted, the team will engage elementary school students from around the country in the project, sharing data live from the field in real time. Students will learn how to analyze and interpret the project data through the researchers' STEM K-12 initiative: The Malaysian Bat Education Adventure.  Using an existing Biodiversity module (grades 5-6) and a new module ""Microbial Diversity: What's in your bat?"" (grades 6-7), students will be introduced to topics of microbial ecology and diversity. The program's success in changing student STEM knowledge, skills and attitude will be evaluated with quantitative methods in a pre- and post- intervention design with control group.<br/><br/>The research will determine the relative role of community processes in structuring gut-microbial composition and function in insectivorous bat species co-distributed across a gradient of habitat degradation. The researchers hypothesize that microbiome community assembly and disassembly involve deterministic processes of niche filtering, species interactions, and dispersal. This research will test the hypothesis that changes in host ecology wrought by habitat degradation will alter the relative influence of these processes with consequences for community composition and function. Bats will be studied across a forest modification gradient in Malaysia, and individually-matched samples of gut-microbial composition, metagenome function, dietary composition, host genotype and measures of social interaction obtained for each bat. These data, in conjunction with analyses of co-occurrence, phylogenetic and functional trait patterns, will be used to test structural equation models specified to untangle the processes structuring communities in a causal modeling framework. Evidence of the role of dispersal in structuring microbiomes will derive from comparisons of co-distributed host species that differ in sociality. Interspecific associations will be assessed using co-occurrence network approaches. Functional trait space is developed from genomic inference for each bacterial phylotype within an individual bat's microbiome. Phylogenies are estimated using maximum likelihood and 16S gene alignment among community members. To test the role of diet and host genetics (the host environment) in community processes, the researchers describe diet from feces with the COI DNA barcodes, and quantify host diversity and relatedness through genome fingerprinting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organometallic molecules consist of an organic component (mostly carbon and hydrogen atoms) and metal atoms which play a key role in how the molecules interact with light.   The main focus of this project is to understand the first steps following absorption of light, how the energy is transported through the different molecular architectures and how the structure of the molecules can help enhance and control the energy transport process. This project involves tuning the electronic properties of the molecules by varying the kinds of metal atoms used or the nearby organic structures (called ""ligands"") to which the metal atoms are attached.  By observing how energy and electrons move through molecules after they are exposed to light, the Kleiman research team can provide the fundamental information that will be needed to develop efficient solar energy capture and transport systems based on organometallic molecules.  It is noted that energy and electron transfer processes in organometallic ssytems occur in very fast time scales (a millionth of a millionth of a second).  Thus, these studies utilize ultrafast laser spectroscopy tools, including the use of multidimensional spectroscopies developed in the Kleiman laboratory.<br/><br/>The project aims at fundamental understanding of the excited state dynamical parameters leading to photoinduced energy transfer, photoinduced-multielectron-redox reactions, and their competition, as they are modulated by the nature of the metal center and the organic ligands. A major question to answer is the role of vectorial energy transfer vs potential delocalization of the excited states. Within this context the project opens a new venue for the exploration of excited state dynamics and couplings of cyano-bridged metallo-dimers, oligomers and nanoparticles using ultrafast broadband Transient Absorption Spectroscopy combined with 2-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy to explore the initial steps following photoexcitation in multi-metal architectures with organic ligands that allow the modulation of their HOMO-LUMO gaps and state couplings. The investigations will include assemblies of increased complexity where the photophysics can be modulated by the orientation of different organic ligands, and where metal centers are covalently bound through NC bridges whose own orbitals cannot trap the excitation but can open coupling-channels between different centers. The broader impact of this project includes the internationalization of graduate education through the collaboration with a laboratory in the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina). Additionally, undergraduate, graduate and postdoc students will learn to use state of the art tools and become proficient in recent spectroscopy technological advances preparing them for careers in industry and/or academia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On land, annual variations in crustal seismic velocities have been tied to seasonal changes in temperature, ground-water, or snow/ice pack. In the deep sea, no such seasonal variations should exist and yet recent observations at Axial Volcano using the cabled ocean bottom seismograph network find annual seismic velocity variations. This project will investigate the robustness of the deep sea observations by looking at seafloor cabled data from other nearby settings (e.g. Hydrate Ridge).  It is hypothesized that either there is a seasonal change in the characteristics of the noise source large enough to generate the observed velocity difference, or there is some geophysical process, such as crack opening, that is responding to annual forcings.  The results are likely to either demonstrate that current assumptions about seasonal variability in terrestrial observations need to be revisited, or that the crust may be deforming due to some external forcing such as annual solid earth tidal forces. Both have significant broader impacts for the field, and how ambient noise results might be interpreted. The project will also support one chapter of a graduate student's thesis.<br/><br/>Ambient noise can be used to measure annual changes in geophysical properties through changes in seismic velocity. The correlation function of continuous ambient noise recorded at two seismometers is proportional to the Green's function of the medium between the two sensors. This can then be utilized to image the velocity structure of Earth's subsurface. Evidence for annual changes in velocity at Axial, which are consistent over 3 years of recording suggest that either there is a seasonal change in the characteristics of the noise source large enough to generate the observed velocity difference, or there is some geophysical process, such as crack opening, that is responding to annual forcings. This project will investigate both these options by looking at seafloor cabled data in other settings (e.g. Hydrate Ridge) to test the robustness of the observation, and by constraining the depth extent of the velocity changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the exact logic for making decisions in different applications requires domain-specific insights, it typically relies on computing quantitative summaries of large data streams in an efficient and incremental manner. Programming the desired logic is challenging due to the enormous volume of data and hard constraints on available memory and response time. This project aims to assist IoT programmers in meeting this challenge by designing a query language with natural and high-level constructs suitable for processing streaming data, supported by a compiler and run-time system to facilitate deployment while meeting the constraints of desired accuracy, memory footprint, and real-time response.<br/><br/>The design of the query language draws upon insights from two distinct paradigms: extensions of relational query languages for handling streaming data, and state-based languages for runtime monitoring and synchronous programming. The novel integration of linguistic constructs allows the programmer to impart input data stream a logical hierarchical structure  and also employ relational constructs to partition the input data by keys and to merge data streams from different sensors. While theory of approximation and streaming algorithms allows exploration of trade-offs among language features, accuracy, and processing time during compilation, distributed platforms such as Apache Storm are used for high performance processing.  Two application domains, device monitoring for physiological patient data and dynamic monitoring of network traffic for anomalies, are used for experimental evaluation.

Answering these questions is based on studying statistically stationary regimes of the system's evolution. This project is targeted at existence/nonexistence of such statistically stationary regimes, their description and behavior for several types of random dynamical systems arising in various applications from traffic to neuronal systems to the large-scale structure of the Universe: (i) randomly forced Hamilton-Jacobi equations;  (ii) small random perturbations of dynamical systems with multiple instabilities;  (iii) systems with random switching.<br/><br/>For general randomly forced Hamilton-Jacobi equations, the PI proposes to obtain a description of the global behavior in terms of one-sided action minimizers and their positive temperature counterparts, thermodynamic one-sided limits for directed polymers. For this, the PI proposes an extension of the notion of the directed polymer from quadratic to general Hamiltonians. Further questions  that the PI will address are: localization/delocalization, characteristic exponents, the renormalization group associated with the flow of monotone transformations defined by global solutions, the fixed points of this renormalization group and simplified discrete models, statistics of shock magnitudes and ages. Small noisy perturbations will mainly be studied for dynamical systems with heteroclinic networks, consisting of multiple unstable equilibria connected to each other by heteroclinic orbits, on much longer time scales than those already studied in the literature. This will allow to make conclusions about the behavior of invariant distributions and approach homogenization questions. For this, the mechanism of unlikely transitions in the network and the associated time scales will be studied in detail. The small scale analysis of the involved random variables will involve Malliavin calculus. For systems with random switchings, the previous work showed that under broad Hrmander-type hypoellipticity conditions, these systems have a unique invariant measure and this measure is absolutely continuous. Obtaining further regularity of the invariant density, studying its smoothness and the character of singularities turned out to be a hard problem.

The PI proposes a comprehensive research plan to underpin the fundamental mechanism of conductivity in the nanoparticles grafted with poly(methyl methacrylate-b-styrenesulfonate) chains with low sulfonation amounts in ionic liquids.

The PI will study segmental chain dynamics and ion transport of the synthesized grafted nanoparticle films using the quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments. The measured chain and ion mobility will be combined with the structural information obtained from X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and tomography. The major objectives of the project are to understand the assembly of poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted iron oxide nanoparticles in various solvents and ionic liquids under confinement; and to determine the effect of styrenesulfonate chain end groups on the assembly of poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted particles and measure its impact on chain dynamics and conductivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Salts of this type can be used as substitutes for more traditional liquids in applications ranging from heat transfer fluids and high-performance lubricants to biomass processing and the synthesis of important electronic materials such as semiconductors. The project brings together elements of chemical synthesis as well as material science and engineering, and offers engaged students a broad opportunity for gaining experience from a spectrum of activities.

Because of their non-volatility, ionic liquids can be used in applications requiring high temperatures, such as in heat transfer, lubrication, or high-temperature materials synthesis. Although typical ionic liquid salts have relatively high degrees of thermal stability, many of them are still incapable of being used for long durations at temperatures above 200 degrees Celsius.  By exploiting tetraarylphosphonium and triarylsulfonium salts, ionic liquid salts capable of remaining stable at temperatures of 300 degrees Celsius for periods over three months have been achieved by Professor Davis' group.

The involvement of undergraduate students in stochastic analysis and simulations will enhance their ability to work at the interface between probability and applied sciences. <br/><br/>The principal investigator aims to design various spatial stochastic models, including nonstandard interacting particle systems, interacting superprocesses, and coupled stochastic partial differential equations on general metric graphs, to contribute to a deeper understanding of the effect of spatial structures and randomness on various population dynamics and their genealogies in different scales of observation. New challenges arise in the study of well-posedness and time asymptotic properties of these models. The project will focus on two research directions.<br/>(i) Explore new connections among these models. Outcomes of this research are expected to include scaling limit theorems and duality formulas that rigorously justify the new connections.<br/>(ii) Study the long-time behavior of these spatial stochastic models. New probabilistic methods will be developed to compute quantities of interest, such as the asymptotic shape of competition outcome and the propagation speeds of travelling waves on networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What may have begun as simple curiosity--for instance, the impulse to construct and classify the regular polyhedra nearly two and a half thousand years ago--has turned out time and again to be the most effective way to study some of the most fundamental objects of mathematics and physics, whether through the more concrete symmetries of geometrical objects or the more abstract (but essential to our digital world) symmetries of quantum mechanics. Perhaps the most surprising role of symmetry in the sciences is in the study of the prime numbers, the fundamental objects of arithmetic, where there are no manifest ""symmetries"" such as one encounters in geometry. Nevertheless, much of our deepest knowledge of prime numbers comes from their connections with the ""symmetries"" of polynomial equations, a subject known as Galois theory. This research project will study Galois representations, which are natural packages for algebraically encoding information about prime numbers. One of the central programs of modern number theory, proposes new ways to ""unpack"" Galois representations by relating them to remarkably different mathematical objects arising in geometry. The PI will continue his research in this direction to describe these mysterious but absolutely fundamental relationships. As part of the educational component of this CAREER project, the PI will undertake a series of educational projects serving a variety of audiences. He will continue to run an intensive summer number theory program for Utah high school students, introducing them to mathematics as an object of experimentation and discovery, and thereby encouraging them to develop the habits of mind essential to creative intellectual work. This program involves both graduate students and local high school teachers as co-teachers, who can then carry its distinctive pedagogical model with them to other educational settings. With a view toward exciting a broader mathematical public, the PI will also, in conjunction with teaching a history of mathematics course at The University of Utah, develop curricular materials, particularly videos, to be disseminated online, in the history of mathematics. Finally, he will continue his work  training PhD students.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the Langlands program is a series of conjectures that guide much contemporary work in number theory, and in particular provide the deepest conjectural answers to problems relating Galois theory and prime numbers. In doing so, they reach out from number theory to algebraic geometry, representation theory, and beyond. The PI complete two main projects within the very broad purview of the Langlands program. The first concerns the deformation theory of Galois representations, one of the two pillars on which the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was built, and ever since one of the central research areas within algebraic number theory. Here the PI will study the deformation theory of Galois representations valued in general reductive groups; broadly, this work aims at generalizations of Serre's famous modularity conjecture. The second main project concerns the relationship between Galois representations and motives, the latter being in some sense the best linear approximation to the category of algebraic varieties, of fundamental interest in its own right, but also conjecturally the algebro-geometric counterpart of Galois representations. Here the PI will study a variety of problems concerned with establishing the motivic origin of Galois representations. These include instances of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture related to the PI's generalized Kuga-Satake theory; study of anabelian properties of moduli spaces; and motivic constructions underlying fundamental objects of geometric representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop eDNA methods suitable for inventorying paleosediments in warmer climates by focusing on southern California, an area with a diverse history of environmental and landscape change over the timespan characterized by continuous human presence.  The investigators will recover DNA shed by plants, animals, and microbes from well-dated, environmentally sensitive lake sediment cores, and they will use these data in combination with other paleoecological proxies.  Using DNA techniques involving metabarcoding and hybridization, the investigators will inventory the flora and fauna of the past at low and high elevations levels and with different temperatures.

One of the biggest unknowns about past climate is the origin of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) variability over global warm-cold cycles. This project will address potential causes of the varying atmospheric carbon dioxide by focusing on changes in the efficiency of fertilization of the surface ocean, and how, and if, that is related to changes in the deep-ocean. Furthermore, the research will investigate both the ""how"" of varying carbon dioxide with the ""where"", namely the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP), an important region of the world ocean where, today, significant CO2 is exhaled to the atmosphere and the greatest rates of phytoplankton growth are found. The project will contribute to an improved understanding of global climate change and important Earth systems connected to the tropical Pacific Ocean. On the broadest of levels, understanding the past dynamics of Earth's carbon cycle is of fundamental importance to inform and guide societal policy-making in an increasing CO2 world. The project will support the educational and professional development of graduate and undergraduate students and results will be incorporated into the curriculum of undergraduate and graduate classes. In addition, a series of YouTube videos will be developed that are aimed at communicating the importance of how past climate variability informs us about climate's future variability and its potential impact on our lives.<br/><br/>The project seeks to answer questions related to: 1) where and how atmospheric carbon dioxide was sequestered from the atmosphere, or ventilated from the ocean, on millennial timescales, and 2) how these carbon dynamics are related to both changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation over the last glacial period and into the deglacial and Holocene. To address these objectives, an integrated suite of multiple proxies will be measured in two high accumulation rate sediment cores previously collected from the EEP. These proxies include: authigenic uranium as a proxy for bottom water oxygenation and radiocarbon ages of benthic foraminifera as a proxy for changes in the age of deep water in the EEP, 231Pa/230Th ratios and excess Ba fluxes as proxies for productivity, excess 230Th-derived 232Th flux as a proxy for dust flux, B/Ca ratios in planktonic foraminifera as a proxy for carbonate ion concentration of surface water, and Nd and Pb isotope ratios as a proxy for the provenance of the dust source of the detrital component of the sediment and, therefore, an index of Intertropical Convergence Zone migration. By investigating the storage of a respired carbon pool in the deep ocean during cold periods of the last glacial period (i.e., from ~71,000 to 14,000 years ago), in conjunction with probing how this storage relates to changes in export production and potential iron fertilization, the research will shed light on the mechanistic links between ocean (stratification/ventilation) and atmospheric (wind belt shifts) circulation and the modification of atmospheric CO2 levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These concepts are anticipated to be competitive with the most efficient methodologies currently available in biology. The outcome of this work is expected to facilitate control of supramolecular electronic properties of interest for applications such as solar cells, new tools for medical devices including drug delivery, environmental aspects of polymer materials, and other uses. This research involves an interdisciplinary program at the interface between organic, macromolecular and supramolecular chemistry, physics, biology, synthetic biology, and materials science; it also includes collaborations with scientists from around the world. This program will also enable the education of undergraduate and graduate students, high-school students, and postdoctoral scientists.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Frank-Kasper phases were first discovered and employed in metal alloys. In soft matter they were discovered in a related NSF program and recently also in block-copolymers, surfactants and other assemblies. They are expected to evolve soon into new technological applications. However, many supramolecular spherical assemblies are helical and therefore chiral and the molecular mechanism as well as the role of homochirality in these phases remains to be understood.  The structures and properties generated by memory effects in these materials are accessible only by chiral supramolecular dendrimers and by other monodisperse assemblies. Therefore, this project will elucidate the role of chirality in Frank-Kasper soft phases and will be fundamental for the development of new material properties from polymers and any other organic materials.<br/><br/>Even though most polymeric and organic materials exhibit helical structures and are therefore chiral, they are considered to be racemic when assembled from achiral or racemic building blocks and display low-ordered structures and properties.  This supramolecular trend is similar to that of isotactic (homochiral), syndiotactic (heterochiral), and atactic (racemic) polymers.  A new mechanism of crystallization, the cogwheel mechanism that disregards chirality, has recently been  discovered and shown to be potentially  able to eliminate the difference regarding the perfection of helical structures generated from chiral versus racemic building blocks. The generality of this mechanism to combinations of racemic and achiral building blocks to generate the same material properties as the homochiral ones will be studied. The outcome of this research will have broad scientific impact across many types of materials, including electronic, medical, and other applications.<br/><br/>Another aspect of this project involves monodisperse polymers.  Monodisperse polymers containing single-dimension species are produced only by biology. This research will include continued development of self-interrupted living polymerization, which will enable study of similarities and differences between the structure and properties of truly monodisperse polymers versus those of narrow dispersity produced by standard living polymerizations.  These will also impact broad areas involving the design of polymeric materials with numerous potential applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polynomial equations arise naturally in a number of situations, and commutative algebra continues to develop a fascinating interaction with several fields, becoming an increasingly valuable tool in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The focus of the project is on questions in commutative algebra relating to local cohomology, tight closure theory, and classical rings of invariants; all of these questions arise quite naturally from recent developments. Local cohomology often provides the best answers to fundamental questions such as the least number of polynomial equations needed to define a solution set. Projects in this direction include algorithmic aspects as well as structural properties; there is a special focus on local cohomology modules of polynomial rings over the integers: this stems from the fact that there is a canonical homomorphism from the integers to any ring, and this makes local cohomology modules over the integers, in a sense, universal. This viewpoint has proved useful in recent joint work with Lyubeznik and Walther. At the same time, new techniques for investigating local cohomology over the integers have been developed in joint work with Bhatt, Blickle, Lyubeznik, and Zhang; it is proposed to extend these new techniques to an algorithm. Projects related to tight closure theory include investigating the singularities of Hankel determinantal rings, a question coming from recent joint work with Conca, Mostafazadehfard, and Varbaro, and whether these rings arise as invariant rings for actions of linearly reductive groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many lakes, however, are now experiencing increased input of carbon and nutrients, warming temperatures, and declining ice cover, which may reduce water quality or cause blooms of potentially harmful algae. Specifically, many lakes across the United States are experiencing increased browning due to high loading of organic matter leached from land plants. Browning reduces water clarity and interferes with drinking water management practices. In addition, it can cause other changes that may lead to rapid long-term declines in water quality. This research will test the hypothesis that browning may reduce oxygen concentrations in lakes. Low oxygen can cause nutrient release from lake sediments that may increase algae blooms, leading to lake eutrophication. Understanding the effects of browning will increase knowledge of lake ecosystems, and improve forecasts of how lakes will change as their surrounding environments change.  This research will also train graduate and undergraduate students, and will lead to better public understanding of threats to lake water quality.<br/><br/>Ecological tipping points are of vital interest as anthropogenic activities rapidly transform natural ecosystems. Changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) represent one important potential driver of tipping points in aquatic ecosystems. This project will investigate whether increases in terrestrial DOM loading can push clear-water oligotrophic lakes beyond a critical tipping point by stimulating hypolimnetic anoxia and sediment DOM and phosphorus release, which may initiate a positive feedback loop of decreasing water clarity, stronger thermal stratification, and enhanced hypolimnetic anoxia. This feedback loop accelerates ecological change and ultimately may shift lake trophic status toward greener, mesotrophic to eutrophic as well as browner, dystrophic conditions. This project will extend a long-term data set of water quality variables sampled since the late 1980s in two lakes in or near the Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station, located in northeastern Pennsylvania. Complementing these long-term observations, experiments and modeling will be carried out to understand feedbacks associated with browning and enhancing understanding of broader patterns of change in inland water bodies.

People bring their own expectations and assumptions about the data and situations these visualizations represent, though most visualizations do not take these expectations into account. Comparing these expectations to actual data is a powerful tool for checking those assumptions, developing better understanding of situations, and making better decisions.  To support such expectation visualizations, the project team will use a combination of experiments, software development, and design activities to develop toolkits and best practices for developing visualizations that allow viewers to represent, interact with, and see feedback on their own predictions about the data.  The work will focus on helping people better understand scientific research and expert analysis around topics such as health decisions that might impact their own lives.  The work will also support a broader educational goal of data literacy education, through course modules that can be inserted into introductory informatics and data science courses and a new course on thinking with data, and outreach goals through developing a research and development platform where designers, researchers, and developers can work together to improve expectation visualization techniques.  <br/><br/>To do this, the project has three main research goals.  The first is to develop a suite of empirical findings on the effects of expectation visualization, through a series of experiments on how predicting data, receiving personalized feedback on those predictions, and reflecting on gaps between predictions and data affect people's later memory of the data and future expectations. The second thrust builds on the first, using these empirical results along with design studies and comprehensive reviews of existing tools and literature to build a design space with software examples characterizing key decisions in designing expectation visualizations. These decisions will include a range of techniques for graphically eliciting people's expectations, contextualization techniques that help people learn to use those techniques and constrain their choices appropriately, and feedback or reflection techniques that help call attention to places where expectations did and did not match the underlying data.  The third thrust is to put these principles into practice by developing applications to support the communication of uncertainty in experimental results, the reduction of spurious pattern discoveries in data analysis, and the integration of problem context and expert analysis with the visualization itself.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, this program has the potential to broaden participation of diverse people in advanced technical careers.<br/><br/>This project will enable the college to offer an updated CIS program that can meet the needs of students for cybersecurity training or certifications. To achieve these results, the project will: (a) develop coursework that scaffolds learning and supports student advancement; (b) promote networking and cybersecurity opportunities by using culturally contextualized student/parent awareness programs and professional development for high school and college faculty and advisors; and (c) work with industry to promote career opportunities in networking and cybersecurity. Students in this program will be able to earn certifications including A+, Security+, Network +, Cisco CCENT, or CCNA certifications in one or more areas.  These certifications will increase students? employability and make them more qualified as employees. The project plan builds on the work of three existing ATE Cybersecurity Centers (CSSIA, CyberWatch and CyberWatch West) and will add to that body of knowledge. The project?s industry partners have committed to defining the CIS/cybersecurity knowledge, skills and abilities needed to meet their workforce needs, which in turn will inform development of the revised CIS curriculum.  The industry partners will also help students prepare for future careers by offering internships and job shadowing opportunities. As one of the 12 college systems in Texas selected in the first cohort of the Texas Pathways Project (Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board's 60x30TX initiative), the project will build on and coordinate with those state-wide efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The learned representation encoded in the parameters of DNNs have shown remarkable transferability to a wide range of tasks. However, the dependency on supervised learning substantially limits the scalability to new problem domains because manual labeling is often expensive and in some cases requires expertise. In contrast, a massive amount of free unlabeled images and videos are readily available on the Internet. This project develops algorithms to capitalize on large amounts of unlabeled videos for representation learning and adaptation. The developed methods significantly alleviate the high cost and scarcity of manual annotations for constructing large-scale datasets. The project involves both graduate and undergraduate students in the research. The research materials are also integrated to curriculum development in courses on deep learning for machine perception. Results will be disseminated through scientific publications, open-source software, and dataset releases.<br/><br/>This research tackles two key problems in representation learning. In the first research aim, the project simultaneously leverages spatial and temporal contexts in videos to learn generalizable representation. The research takes advantages of rich supervisory signals for representation learning from appearance variations and temporal coherence in videos. Compared to the supervised counterpart (which requires millions of manually labeled images), learning from unlabeled videos is inexpensive and is not limited in scope. The project also seeks to adapt the learned representation to handle appearance variations in new domains with minimal manual supervision. The effectiveness of representation adaptation is validated in the context of instance-level video object segmentation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How continents break apart by rifting processes is thought to be predefined by inherent structural and compositional variability of Earth's crust and mantle that make up the lithosphere and is likely inherited from previous tectonic events. Understanding the style of continental breakup provides fundamental information for the exploration for energy and mineral resources and to understanding the geologic hazards associated with these processes. Geological observations often support the fact that these inheritances are key parameters in the development of rift structures but the extent to which these inheritances play a role during the rifting process remain unclear. This project investigates how the variable composition of continental lithosphere and the presence of inherited geological structures affect rifting processes. A multi-disciplinary approach will employ geological and geophysical observations to characterize inheritances in the crust and mantle of the lithosphere. These observations will be integrated into numerical models that simulate the deformation of the lithosphere over millions of years by extension.  The results of this project will fundamentally advance the understanding of lithospheric scale deformation processes and impact structural geology, computational geosciences and potentially the fossil fuel communities. Under broader impacts the project supports an early career female researcher at Texas State University, a primarily Hispanic-serving institution, and a master student will be recruited to participate directly in the research.<br/><br/>Passive margins define about half of the Earth's coastlines and have been the focus of numerous studies in recent decades. While understanding of rifting processes has greatly improved, fundamental questions remain on the effects of inherited conditions on localization processes in extending lithosphere. Multiple studies suggest that structural, compositional and thermal inheritances are key parameters in the development of rift structures. However, the extent to which they play a role during breakup is still unclear. This project will address the hypothesis that inheritances strongly affect rifting processes and can explain: 1) the distribution of strain during the initial phase of deformation, 2) the mechanism of thinning during the rifting process, and 3) the mechanism leading to the exhumation and/or the formation of oceanic crust. To test this hypothesis numerical rifting experiments will be run with both structural and compositional inheritances. Inheritances are parameterized as oriented fabrics obtained from 2D seismic and 3D structural observations. A polymineralic composition is assigned to these heterogeneities in order to account for the natural variation in compositions observed in the continental lithosphere. In order to constrain the models, a multidisciplinary approach will be used that combines: 1) the analysis of geological and geophysical data, 2) a systematic exploration of the effects of numerical modeling experiments using a bimineralic rheology, and 3) a case study of the Northeastern Canadian margin with 2D and 3D numerical models. This approach will allow for a large amount of quantitative information on rift evolution to be acquired by independently varying the composition, distribution and orientation of inheritances. Results will help improve understanding of strain distribution, localization processes and mechanisms of deformation during continental breakup, and visualize the dynamic evolution of rifting processes depending on the type of inheritances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scintillators are materials that emit visible light when exposed to radiation, and the better the scintillator, the brighter the light and the smaller the amount of radioactive material that can be detected. This research, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, involves the fundamental aspects of crystal growth of improved scintillating materials and thereby advances the field of radiation detection.

There exists a pressing need for large quantities of efficient scintillating materials for improved radiation detection. This research focuses on the synthesis of new neutron, X-ray, and gamma-ray activated scintillating oxides. Fluorine in mixed anion phases has been identified as one element that plays a crucial role in the intensity of fluorescence, and it has been demonstrated that fluorine can also increase the scintillation efficiency of rare earth silicates. Specifically, it is known that luminescent oxyfluorides in which the fluorine anions are located in LnOxFy polyhedra, such as in Cs3LnSi4O10F2 (Ln = Eu, Tb), a recently discovered brightly scintillating material, can exhibit scintillation as bright as Lu2SiO5:Ce3+. The targeted crystal growth of fluorine containing mixed-anion phases takes advantage of a recently developed enhanced flux growth technique that is known to yield crystals of oxyfluorides and salt-inclusion silicates. To better understand the processes involved in the formation of mixed anion phases in the various flux environments that are used for synthesis of complex oxide single crystals, in-situ neutron diffraction experiments are carried out to identify the optimal growth conditions for preparing new scintillators in the laboratory as well as to transform crystal growth from an empirical to a deliberate process.

The demand for skilled trades personnel in these industries has increased, with 5000 new postings for South East Michigan region alone.  Total employment for these industries is about 113,000 workers (Workforce Intelligence Networks, 2017). Half of these workers are welders, fabricators, and tool and die makers. This Monroe County Community College welding technology project is designed to increase the number of qualified welders who can lead research, development, and innovation in the advanced manufacturing field. The project will develop new curriculum materials and implement them in courses conforming to Advanced Level Welder QC 11 training standards.  These standards were revised in August 2017 and further defined by the Schools Excelling Through National Skills Standards Education Program led by the American Welding Society. By incorporating the latest additions to the Advanced Level QC 11 standards, the college aims to produce highly skilled welders who can support research and development.  This training will also enable students to pursue associate of applied science and/or baccalaureate degree. The project will include existing articulation pathways between the college and area universities, and will develop new articulation/transfer pathways to other four-year schools. The project will also add to the pool of qualified Inspectors in Non-Destructive Testing, a field in which the college offers the state's only certificate program.  By completing these activities, this project has the potential to help students advance educationally and occupationally, thus making a significant impact on the economy of the Southeast Michigan region.<br/><br/>This project builds on a $1.75 million Department of Labor grant that aimed to improve the welder pool in the region. The college met the goals of that grant by producing the promised number of graduates. As part of that grant, the college developed partnerships with nine high school districts, enabling the college to reach more than 1500 potential students. In this project, the college will leverage those partnerships by providing professional development to high school career and technical education program instructors.  As a result, it is expected that Level 1 Entry Level QC 10 standards will be completed at the high schools and the college will focus on teaching the new and revised Advanced Level QC 11 standards.  Direct articulation agreements will be developed to support this educational pathway.  The program aims to: (a) provide students increased opportunities to earn entry to advanced American Welding Society credentials, which can improve their employability; and (b) strengthen the relationship between the college and local employers by educating a well-educated workforce to meet employer needs at varying levels of welder expertise and experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the lesser-understood factors that influences snowflake structures, densities and number concentrations is wind.  Traditional methods to make ground or near-ground observations of falling or lofted snow in high wind conditions are difficult.  Newer instruments, such as those used for airborne research, are expensive or have other limitations.  In this project, the research team will deploy a new balloon-borne instrument to make measurements of snowflakes from the surface to the top of the precipitation layer.  A set of additional instrumentation will also be deployed to complement those measurements in a field campaign that will involve students from elementary school to graduate level.  The first order impact of the award will be to test a new, inexpensive technology for making measurements of snow.  The larger potential impact of the work would be to improve model representation of snow for improved weather forecasts.  The award also includes a significant education and public outreach component, leading to improved public understanding of science and training of the next generation of researchers.<br/><br/>The main goal of this award is to improve observational knowledge of the microphysical aspects of snow during windy conditions.  It is difficult to make ground or near-ground observations of falling or lofted snow using traditional techniques due to blurring of the images, flow around instruments, and the lack of ability to vertically profile.  In addition, advanced instruments for snowflake classification are either expensive or unavailable for small deployments.  In this project, the research team will make use of a combination of instruments, featuring the Particle Size, Image, and Velocity (PASIV) probes developed at the National Severe Storms Lab.  The PASIV can be attached to a balloon for a vertical profile of particle counts and number concentration estimation.  At the ground level, the research team will make use of a camera-strobe light setup where the focal plane of the camera is 1-2m from any potential flow disruption.  Additional instruments will include a cloud particle imager and disdrometer.  The field site is within view of the operational WSR-88D radar and the UND C-band radar.  Overall, the design of the field experiment is set to answer two main questions:  1) How do microphysical properties of ice-phase hydrometeors vary over horizontal and vertical scales of 100m to 10km within falling and lofted snow events, and 2) How well do varying instrument designs function in windy environments?  The intended broader impacts include a significant outreach and education plan associated with the field campaign.  A graduate student will be funded by the project and approximately 20 undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the planning, teaching, forecasting, and collection of data for the field campaign.  K-12 outreach will include snowfall and visibility measurements made by students during winter events, the development of a winter-weather curricula, and teaching of the unit to tribal groups through partnership with an existing EPSCoR award.  Outreach via media and tours will also be conducted.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These substances are of considerable scientific and commercial interest for a wide variety of applications including energy storage, chemical sensors, and biomedical devices.  However, the fundamental mechanisms by which these materials transition from small-molecule liquids to polymer solids are not well understood.  This lack of scientific understanding limits the ability to precisely tailor these materials for specific purposes.  Specialized electron-microscopic sample stages are now available that allow for detailed local studies of the formation of these materials, revealing previously unknown aspects of this complex process.  This project will monitor the local shape and chemistry of the reaction products formed as the material proceeds from precursor liquids, through sticky intermediates, to the final solid conjugated polymer products using a high-resolution electron microscope and related analysis techniques.  The work will also enable graduate students in materials science and engineering to obtain specialized advanced education and establish new insights about the formation of polymers from small molecules using an electrochemical reaction. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>It has been previously established that in-situ, environmentally-controlled electron-microscopic sample stages can be used to directly monitor the electrochemical transition from a solution of liquid organic monomer 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) to the final poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) conjugated polymer product using low-dose transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  However many fundamental questions remain unknown about the process, including the influence of comonomers and introduction of solid nanoparticles in the reaction medium.  This research project will quantify the influence of these variations in chemistry and composition on the deposition process, particularly the nucleation, growth, and redissolving of oligomer droplets back into solution when using a more hydrophilic co-monomer (EDOTacid).  The TEM experiments will be complemented with methods able to provide additional information about the chemical changes associated with the reaction, including optical microscopy, nanoscale FTIR/AFM, and microfocused Raman spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But precisely how much outgassing occurs and what factors control the rates of outgassing remain poorly understood, especially in the lower, tidal reaches of large tropical rivers. Most measurements of outgassing are made far upstream of the ocean, and oceanography studies are restricted to zones that are offshore. This leaves a major knowledge gap, with little or no data available for extensive river reaches between upstream gauging station and offshore sites where oceanographic research vessels pick up the signal at sea. This project, with a focus on the Amazon River, will provide greater insights into how riverine carbon cycles function, and ultimately their influence on global cycles. The coupled models developed for the project will be available to policy makers for use in evaluating broader water resource issues of the changing Amazon basin.  The project will support the training of one graduate student and an undergraduate student recruited from an underrepresented minority. <br/>   <br/>This research will use a combination of river boat expeditions, remote sensing, and modeling to test the hypothesis that dissolved CO2 levels remain above atmospheric saturation along the entire lower river and in the inner reaches of the plume. Under those conditions the Amazon River plume would act as a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere when freshwaters and low salinity waters are fully considered. The hypothesis that gaseous, dissolved, and particulate concentrations of carbon vary consistently with the tide will be evaluated through detailed measurements over tidal cycles. To obtain insights into the biological mechanisms regulating organic matter decomposition and energy production a combination of proteomic signatures of microbial metabolism and dissolved organic matter characterization by ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry will be employed. Finally, a detailed hydrodynamic model, that includes biological processes and inputs from a basin hydrology model, will be used to provide synthesis across the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the critical importance of mountains in shaping geologic hazards, sediment export and global environmental conditions, there are few ways of quantifying their growth over time. This project is focused on development of a new tool to quantify changes in the paleoelevation of mountains that will have implications for geophysics, the oil and gas industry and studies of surface change. This project benefits society by contributing to the development of a globally competitive STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) work force by providing support for graduate student training in a core STEM discipline. Further societal benefits include support for the integration of earth science education into Connecticut State Science Standards through the creation of a new STEM education outreach collaboration with Hartford area STEM Magnate schools that serve a majority minority population. This outreach program, entitled ""Mountains, Rivers and Carbon"", provides traditionally-underrepresented students with hands-on exposure to earth science research, routine engagement with the principal investigator, and opportunities for students to participate in a workshop at the University of Connecticut campus that bridges sampling in a modern river with activities in a working lab and engagement with university faculty and students. The research is also fostering the development of new international collaborations between U.S. and Taiwan scientists.<br/> <br/> <br/>This research is developing a new geochemical tool to reconstruct the paleoelevation history of mountain belts based on the isotope chemistry of organic matter preserved in sedimentary archives. This method, entitled Organic Molecular Paleohypsometry, exploits the measured and predictable variation in the stable isotope composition of water and organic matter as a function of elevation. Organic matter sourced from different elevations is characterized by distinct stable isotopic signatures, and changes in the isotope chemistry of sedimentary organic matter should reflect changes in the integrated elevation of the source area. The method is being tested, refined and applied to Taiwan, one of the fastest uplifting and eroding regions of the globe, but a region for which no paleoelevation technique has been applicable, until now. Calibration of this method includes sampling of modern river waters, soils and sediments from across Taiwan to quantify how the isotope chemistry of organic matter in river sediments reflects the chemistry of organic material from across mountainous catchments. This approach will be applied to geologically-recent marine and terrestrial floodplain sediment cores from the Gaoping river and submarine canyon to examine short-timescale effects on organic molecular signatures during the recent late Pleistocene global deglaciation. In addition, the proposed research focuses on the analysis of 5 million year and younger sediments from basins along western Taiwan to test whether organic molecular records of the Taiwan orogen show that it was uplifted simultaneously along the length of the island, or experienced a southward propagation of high topography over the last 1.5 million years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are essential for animal life. With advances in DNA sequencing it has recently been shown that some individuals may possess multiple, distinct lineages of mitochondria in their cells.  This suggests that the presence of multiple types of mitochondria, a condition known as heteroplasmy, may be an integral part of the evolution of many species.  This finding is very surprising, because mitochondria, almost always are inherited from the mother only, and in humans, heteroplasmy has been linked to severe genetic disease. From an evolutionary perspective, the presence of more than one type of mitochondria in an individual may have an important function in generating genetic diversity.  It is likely that the presence of multiple types of mitochondria presents opportunities to exchange genes between different mitochondrial lineages. Despite growing recognition of the potential significance of heteroplasmy, this aspect of animal evolution remains poorly understood. This project aims to address key questions relating to how heteroplasmy is generated, how long it can be maintained, and whether genes are exchanged between mitochondrial lineages. The bed bug will be used as a model species for these studies because it exhibits unusually high levels of heteroplasmy. Experiments to resolve these questions have the potential to fundamentally change how we look at genetic inheritance of mitochondrial DNA in animals. The project will include training of undergraduate and post-doctoral scholars, the establishment of a collaborative network of researchers and pest control operators, and public outreach in both Oklahoma and North Carolina. Furthermore, given that the bed bug is a significant public health concern, establishing it as a model system will continue to bring them to public attention, reinforcing awareness of the species.<br/><br/>While uniparental inheritance appears to predominate in the animal kingdom, the growing evidence of heteroplasmy through paternal leakage and compelling recent evidence of mtDNA recombination, underscores that while we have developed a great understanding of mitochondrial function and evolution, our understanding of mitochondrial inheritance is far from complete. The bed bug, Cimex lectularius, is an ectoparasite that has seen an unprecedented resurgence in recent years. Studies have revealed that it exhibits high levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy, which is both pervasive and rapidly generated. Furthermore, mtDNA recombination appears common. Given the suitability and tractability of this species as a model system, this study will: (1) Address how intra- and inter-population genetic characteristics correlate with rates of heteroplasmy; (2) Investigate the degree to which mitogenomic divergence and mitonuclear interactions affect the rate of paternal leakage; (3) Empirically and theoretically examine heteroplasmy decay in a species where it is common and pervasive and for which genetic drift vs. selection may be evaluated; and (4) Take a complete mitogenomic approach to investigate recombination and the presence of recombination hotspots. Due to the high rate of leakage and recombination seen in the bed bug in concert with recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and analytical methods, this system offers a unique opportunity to address this hotly debated and evolutionarily consequential question.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize the integration of scientific knowledge and the practices of science, a recognition that science classrooms are complex learning environments. Meeting this expectation requires teachers to move beyond traditional routines of practice to become adaptive experts who can adjust their teaching to maximize learning in varied classroom situations. A teacher who has adaptive expertise is defined as someone who can self-assess and strategically adjust decision-making before, during and after teaching episodes. To become adaptive experts, teachers must understand the foundational ways that scientific knowledge is advanced and develop knowledge of, and practices related to, using argument, language, and dialogical environments--individually and collectively--as tools for learning science. To effectively use these tools requires teachers to shift from viewing science teaching as the transfer or replication of knowledge through routines of practices to one in which students are participants in a more cognitively based approach to learning. How teachers develop adaptive expertise for NGSS-aligned learning environments is still little understood. This project will examine the complex nature of the relationship between these learning tools and teacher orientation that enables teachers to develop adaptive expertise over the course of a multi-year professional development program.<br/><br/>The project will work with 150 Grade 3-5 teachers in Iowa and Alabama to implement a three-year professional development program to assist teachers develop adaptive expertise. Through implementation of an argument-based inquiry approach focused on development of adaptiveness, teachers will be supported as they shift their expertise from routine to adaptiveness. Project data will include teachers' implementation of the approach, their understanding of science argument, and their shifting epistemic orientation. The project will examine selected case studies of teachers to better understand the variations in development of adaptive expertise. The project outcome will be a model of adaptive expertise that can be used by in-service and pre-service educators to advance teacher practices towards adaptive expertise. The aim is to design ways to transfer adaptive expertise to students in STEM. The mixed-method project will integrate analyses with a focus on understanding complexity, using large-scale quantitative data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is centered on engaging African-American students by increasing recruitment, retention, graduation rates and job placement in STEM-related fields. <br/><br/>The goals of this Target Infusion Project are to improve the performance in gate-keeping courses leading to an overall increase in retention in the sciences and to strengthen STEM curricula through incorporation of new pedagogical approaches, which promote a greater depth of knowledge in the two most important courses taken by all science majors, leading to an increased enrollment in graduate and professional schools. The three specific objectives to better prepare science majors for 21st-century challenges and careers are 1) Update program content and educational experiences in General and Organic Chemistry courses by infusing POGIL in the teaching pedagogy; 2) Enhance the laboratory courses of General Chemistry I by the infusion of cyber/virtual-labs which will enable motivated students to achieve mastery thus increasing success in the next lab courses; 3) Broaden engagement of students by research interventions in General Chemistry II and Organic Chemistry II labs. The research-based labs would train the science majors for their future research internships at research intensive institutions nationwide, thereby opening up the door toward graduate school.

The Principal Investigator will involve graduate students and postdocs in aspects of the project, assisting their professional development and contributing to the development of the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the project will concern itself with three interrelated areas: BPS Geometry, Singularities, and String Theory.  BPS states are certain supersymmetric states which play a fundamental role in many supersymmetric physical theories.  Geometric techniques will be applied to advance the theory of the associated BPS invariants and their refinements, including orientations on the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi-Yau threefold, Fourier-Mukai transforms as global symmetries of physical theories, a new theory of log BPS invariants, and advancing the connection between Bridgeland stability in mathematics and Pi-stability in physics.   The geometric study of singularities is incorporated into this project in at least two ways: canonical threefold singularities can be used to engineer 5 dimensional superconformal field theories, and certain codimension 2 singularities can be used to engineer gauge theories analogous to the Hitchin system.

Despite these concerns, economists do not understand the sources of increased recidivism.  Understanding the sources of recidivism will therefore contribute to economic science as well as the formulation of policies to reduce recidivism.   This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate whether rehabilitative prisons reduce the rates of recidivism and labor-market participation of prison releasees.  The project will also investigate how prisoners, once transformed by their prison conditions, fit into, and affect their communities when they are released. The research will use experimental methods and data from two alternative prison systems---the traditional punitive system and a modern rehabilitative system---to provide empirical evidence on these questions. The PIs have access to unique data sets on prisoners released from traditional prisons and rehabilitative prisons.  The results of this research project will contribute to the development of policies to make the U.S. correctional system more efficient and therefore establish the US as a global leader in penal reforms.<br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation research project will study the effects of rehabilitative prisons on recidivism rates, labor market attachment of prison releasees, and how releasees contribute to their societies. The PIs have access data sets of prisoners released from traditional and rehabilitative prison.  The research will use two quasi-experimental research design projects to identify causal parameters. The first project uses instrumental variables approach to compare individuals randomly assigned to judges with varying preferences for incarceration and prison type to identify the causal effect of incarceration in punitive prisons or rehabilitative prisons on recidivism, and the difference between them. The second project uses a differences-in-differences estimation strategy that exploits the differential rollout of rehabilitative prisons to identify the long-term effects of additional rehabilitative time. Individuals introduced into rehabilitative prisons at the same time with remaining short sentences serve as a counterfactual to those with long remaining sentences because the prisons sort individuals into homogeneous groups across many factors, but not time.  Both sets of estimates will provide rigorous evidence on the effects of large-scale prison reform on recidivism. This information is important for US policymakers and prison official as they respond to large-scale incarcerated population and the perceived failure of the current system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Parasites, by definition, use energy from the hosts they infect in order to reproduce and spread to new hosts. While previous research has made great strides in understanding how traits of single parasite species affect disease transmission, predicting interactions among co-infecting parasites remains a research frontier. When two parasite species occupy the same host, the outcome of infection may not be the same as when each parasite occurs separately, due to interactions between the parasites. This project will evaluate the consequences of co-infection for host health, the spread of disease, and host population biology, using a model organism that impacts food safety in stored grains. Additionally, this project will provide scientific training and mentoring to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students; identify factors that affect the agricultural control of pests and pollinators; and implement an outreach project to recruit women from under-represented minorities to fields in STEM.<br/><br/>The researchers will use mathematical models and laboratory experiments to evaluate the effects of parasite co-infection on a flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) model host system. The first objective is to determine the mechanisms through which co-infecting parasites interact in order to evaluate the impact of co-infection on parasite growth rates and host infection outcomes. The researchers will manipulate host nutrient acquisition, alter parasite infection routes, and quantify the impact of co-infection on host immune response using next-generation mRNA sequencing. This objective will elucidate the importance of top-down (immune-mediated) versus bottom-up (resource-mediated) ecological interactions for structuring parasite communities within the host. The second objective is to quantify the impact of infection order and the strength of within-host interactions on the transmission of each co-infecting parasite to new flour beetle hosts, connecting within-host to epidemiological processes. The final objective is to develop mathematical models of Tribolium population biology that predict how co-infecting parasites influence host population dynamics and parasite persistence, based on the experimental data.

These 'chiral' chemicals play a central role in living-organisms, where only the left- or right-handed forms are present; but not both. As a result, most biologically active molecules, such as pharmaceuticals, must also be chiral molecules, and they must match the handedness of the biochemicals found in life.  However, producing enantiomerically pure forms of molecules is a challenging problem. In this collaborative research project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism A (CSDM-A) program of the National Science Foundation Division of Chemistry, Professors Andrew Gellman (Carnegie Mellon University) and Charles Sykes (Tufts University) are studying the chemistry of chiral molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces where the atomic structure also has a specific handedness.  Working with their students, Professors Gellman and Sykes are developing curved metal surfaces that present a systematic variation in chiral structures. The designed surfaces enable the study of many atomic configurations with a single sample.  Sophisticated spectroscopies map the chemical reactivity across the surface, while isolated chemical reactions are observed using a high-resolution microscope that can map the positions of individual atoms. In addition to providing training opportunities for future scientists, insights gained from the project could guide the design of surfaces for enantiospecific production of chiral chemicals in the pharmaceutical industry.  <br/><br/>The research targets the surface chemistry of two chiral compounds, tartaric acid (TA) and aspartic acid (Asp), on chiral Cu(hkl) surfaces.  Single crystal Cu surfaces are polished into spherical shapes such that each point on the surface of the sphere exposes a plane with a different atomic structure.  This makes it very efficient to study the adsorption and surface reactions of TA and Asp on all possible structures of a Cu surface; i.e. all possible Miller indices (hkl).  The atomic structures of these surfaces are imaged with and without adsorbed TA and Asp using scanning tunneling microscopy.  Independent measurements of TA and Asp decomposition kinetics are made on hundreds of different Cu(hkl) surfaces, all on a single sample.  These data elucidate surface reaction rate constants as a function of surface orientation, ks(hkl), and hence enable an understanding of the effect of surface structure on chemical and enantiospecific reactivity.  Combined, these data are used to identify those surface orientations with the highest enantioselectivities towards decomposition of the two enantiomers of TA and Asp.  Imaging with the scanning tunneling microscope is then used to determine the atomic structure of the surfaces having greatest enantioselectivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RECCS participants will be mentored through a 9-week research project overseen by preeminent scientists and will receive skills and scientific communication training over the course of the summer. It is expected that the research experience will guide students toward science degrees at four-year institutions. Rigorous program evaluation will provide data to measure the effects of engaging these students in research experiences and subsequent student interest in pursuing STEM-focused four-year college or graduate school degrees and scientific careers. <br/><br/>This summer research program will engage a diverse cadre of community college  , especially those from rural Colorado, in the sciences. Community colleges tend to be diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, and income level, and often include rural, first-generation college or veteran-status students. Studies show that research experiences help students improve their understanding of the scientific process, their ability to read scientific literature critically, and to integrate theory and practice. These students are more likely than others to pursue future research experiences or enroll in graduate school programs. The RECCS research environment is designed to provide several layers of mentoring by scientists, professional development trainers and RECCS staff, as well as peer-group interaction, to instill a sense of belonging within the student cohorts. This structure will ensure that participants receive the support they need to succeed in their projects and to gain confidence in their scientific ability. The involvement of scientists from Colorado University Boulder and local Federal Laboratories will provide students with access to cross-disciplinary and cross-agency expertise and  foster connections and collaborations between those research groups. In addition, RECCS also provides mentoring opportunities for early career scientists. The engagement of students from different community colleges will have a ripple effect on the students around them, hopefully inspiring other community college students to pursue science internships and other research experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Avian brood parasites, birds that provide no parental care to their offspring but instead lay their eggs in the nests of other species, represent an ideal model system for comparative analysis because brood parasitism (and the loss of parental care behavior) evolved independently seven times in five different avian families. This project will characterize patterns of genomic change in both parasitic and non-parasitic birds to test whether changes in the same specific genes and/or parallel patterns of genomic change have occurred in independent brood parasitic lineages. The results will also provide insight into other fundamental questions about genome evolution, including whether genetic changes underlying differences in behavior are most often in regulatory portions of the genome or represent structural changes to the genes themselves. In a second, related line of inquiry, the project will examine the unique evolutionary dynamics of the sex-determination chromosomes, leveraging recent research showing that specialized adaptations for exploiting particular host species are maternally inherited (passed from mother to daughter) and therefore encoded on the avian W-chromosome (analogous to the human Y-chromosome) in three different brood parasitic species. The project will also contribute to the training of scientists at various career stages including undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow. A research experience for undergraduates (REU) component will provide an opportunity for two students from East Carolina University to receive training in bioinformatics at Harvard University. The project will produce high quality genome assemblies for additional bird species, supporting additional comparative analyses of genome evolution across vertebrates, and data from the project will be integrated into educational materials supporting courses in the emerging fields of molecular and population genomics.<br/><br/>Avian brood parasites and their hosts, which exhibit a spectacular diversity of behavioral, morphological and physiological adaptations and counter-adaptations, have served as important models for the study of coevolution. Recent discoveries of genetically divergent, host-specific matrilines within each of three different parasitic species, examples of ""adaptation without recombination"", present a unique opportunity to examine the effects of selection on the non-recombining, sex-limited chromosome. Likewise, with seven independent origins of obligate parasitism and associated loss of parental care, brood parasites offer an unparalleled opportunity to explore the genome-wide consequences of a major life history transition, providing greater power for tests of genomic convergence than in other recent analyses of the genomic basis of phenotypic convergence. Results of the study will lend insight into basic questions about genome evolution, including the relative importance of determinism versus historical contingency, and the manner in which integration versus modularity of genetic networks constrains the outcomes of natural selection. In addition to increasing the number of high quality genome assemblies for birds (currently available for only zebra finch and chicken) and assembling W-chromosome sequences, the proposed study will test two major hypotheses: 1) that evolutionary processes influencing the non-recombining, sex-limited W-chromosome (e.g., Hill-Robertson interference, selective sweeps, genetic hitchhiking) are amplified in parasitic lineages that have maternally inherited host-specific adaptations; and 2) examining all seven parasitic clades, that the evolution of brood parasitism (and loss of parental care behavior) results in genome-wide signatures of molecular convergence and/or convergent changes in coding and/or regulatory regions associated with particular genetic pathways or functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are essential for animal life. With advances in DNA sequencing it has recently been shown that some individuals may possess multiple, distinct lineages of mitochondria in their cells.  This suggests that the presence of multiple types of mitochondria, a condition known as heteroplasmy, may be an integral part of the evolution of many species.  This finding is very surprising, because mitochondria, almost always are inherited from the mother only, and in humans, heteroplasmy has been linked to severe genetic disease. From an evolutionary perspective, the presence of more than one type of mitochondria in an individual may have an important function in generating genetic diversity.  It is likely that the presence of multiple types of mitochondria presents opportunities to exchange genes between different mitochondrial lineages. Despite growing recognition of the potential significance of heteroplasmy, this aspect of animal evolution remains poorly understood. This project aims to address key questions relating to how heteroplasmy is generated, how long it can be maintained, and whether genes are exchanged between mitochondrial lineages. The bed bug will be used as a model species for these studies because it exhibits unusually high levels of heteroplasmy. Experiments to resolve these questions have the potential to fundamentally change how we look at genetic inheritance of mitochondrial DNA in animals. The project will include training of undergraduate and post-doctoral scholars, the establishment of a collaborative network of researchers and pest control operators, and public outreach in both Oklahoma and North Carolina. Furthermore, given that the bed bug is a significant public health concern, establishing it as a model system will continue to bring them to public attention, reinforcing awareness of the species.<br/><br/>While uniparental inheritance appears to predominate in the animal kingdom, the growing evidence of heteroplasmy through paternal leakage and compelling recent evidence of mtDNA recombination, underscores that while we have developed a great understanding of mitochondrial function and evolution, our understanding of mitochondrial inheritance is far from complete. The bed bug, Cimex lectularius, is an ectoparasite that has seen an unprecedented resurgence in recent years. Studies have revealed that it exhibits high levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy, which is both pervasive and rapidly generated. Furthermore, mtDNA recombination appears common. Given the suitability and tractability of this species as a model system, this study will: (1) Address how intra- and inter-population genetic characteristics correlate with rates of heteroplasmy; (2) Investigate the degree to which mitogenomic divergence and mitonuclear interactions affect the rate of paternal leakage; (3) Empirically and theoretically examine heteroplasmy decay in a species where it is common and pervasive and for which genetic drift vs. selection may be evaluated; and (4) Take a complete mitogenomic approach to investigate recombination and the presence of recombination hotspots. Due to the high rate of leakage and recombination seen in the bed bug in concert with recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and analytical methods, this system offers a unique opportunity to address this hotly debated and evolutionarily consequential question.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To ensure safe and reliable positioning, it is critical to address not only positioning accuracy, but also the confidence in accuracy, defined as integrity. Most of the positioning and navigation studies for autonomous vehicles have focused on only accuracy, but not integrity. However, navigating autonomous vehicles equipped with relatively low-cost sensors in complex and rapidly changing environments -- e.g., urban areas with Global Positioning System (GPS) signal blockage -- poses great challenges compared to flying aircraft in the open sky, where positioning integrity has been well addressed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-regulated aviation industry. <br/><br/>This project aims to assess, monitor and improve positioning integrity for autonomous vehicles, such as UAVs and self-driving cars, and integrate the proposed research into education and outreach. The project involves a novel positioning integrity assessment and monitoring solution that is robust in GPS-challenged environments and is suitable for navigation sensor fusion. The investigator will (1) derive a new algorithm to directly assess and monitor GPS integrity in urban environments; (2) design an integrity monitoring framework for GPS sensor fusion using camera vision, LiDAR and inertial measurements; and (3) improve integrity by turning unwanted multi-path signals into a useful navigational source based on physical interaction with the environment. <br/><br/>This CAREER development plan will also integrate an education plan with the research goals by broadening participation of under-represented groups, such as women, by fostering a female researcher community through organizing female social events at technical conferences; educating and informing the public about FAA rules and safety issues regarding flying UAVs; and outreach to K-12 students by demonstrating the results of the proposed research at the Illinois Engineering Open House and leading hands-on activities for various school girl camps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program will provide 12-14 undergraduate students with two to twelve-week internships and one student with a six-month internship each year for the next three years (2018-2021). MATE interns work with marine technicians and scientists onboard research vessels and these experiences provide them with the opportunity to develop their technical, scientific, seamanship and interpersonal skills. Ships that are part of the UNOLS and the USCG fleets will serve as internship hosts. UNOLS and USCG are committed to providing berthing space and meals on their vessels during a research cruise and marine technicians who act as mentors. These internships provide students with the opportunity to develop their technical, scientific, seamanship, and interpersonal skills, and give ocean-related employers access to qualified technical professionals who can fill their workforce needs. While the program is open to all U.S. undergraduates, recruitment efforts are focused on community college students enrolled in marine technology programs and university students interested in marine technical careers. This training effort is important for the continued operation of the U.S. academic research fleet and for the marine industries that benefit by hiring the highly skilled technicians who graduate from the program.  <br/><br/>With a focus on recruiting students from community colleges who are interested in careers as marine technicians, MATE internship program fills a unique need in the continuum of support for undergraduate students in marine sciences. This program provides an excellent bridge between students who need training and experience and academic and industrial employers who need technical support. The MATE internship program will provide a total of forty-five undergraduates with internships over the three-year period. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends and travel to meet the research vessels where they will be working. The MATE internship program supports national goals by developing the next generation of technically skilled workforce.<br/><br/>Skills and experience gained through all MATE internships vary depending on the research vessel, cruise goals and tasks the mentors need to accomplish during the cruise.

Adaptive radiation occurs when a group rapidly diversifies into many species to fill a variety of ecological roles. While adaptive radiation is a common theme in the evolution of life, many of its features are poorly understood. This project seeks to better understand how adaptive radiation proceeds. The project will examine the rate of diversification in genes, morphology and species diversity over the evolutionary history of a group of rodents containing more than 600 species. The study will determine how changes in genes, morphology and species are correlated as the species diversified. Importantly, the group under study contains the common lab mouse and rat, two species that serve as scientific models in medical and basic research. This study will place these model organisms in an evolutionary context that will allow scientists to better understand how their genes and other characteristics have evolved. Such understanding provides new insight into genes and characteristics of medical significance. Scientific meetings organized by the researchers will bring together scientists who study mice and rats from different perspectives, including molecular biology and medicine, to share insight and generate new research questions. In addition to the broader impacts on basic science and medicine, public outreach and education events at participating natural history museums will use the results of this research to teach principles of evolutionary biology to K-12 students and improve public understanding of science.<br/><br/>This project integrates comparative genomics with quantitative morphology in a rigorous phylogenetic framework to illuminate the dynamics of diversification in lineages, phenotypes, and genes across the most species-rich adaptive radiation in mammals. The exceptional species and ecomorphological diversity in rats and mice (subfamily Murinae, 634 living species) arose over the last 14 million years through replicate adaptive radiations, primarily in the distinct biogeographic units of Indo-Australia. This research will expand on the genomic resources from the leading mammalian model organisms to encompass the diversity of murine rodents by sequencing whole exomes from a large, phylogenetically dispersed set of species. In addition, the project will generate high-resolution, 3D morphometric models of cranial and post-cranial skeletons from the same species. The project will combine these distinct data layers to: estimate a species-level phylogeny of the Murinae; identify and date biogeographic and ecological transitions; estimate diversification rate shifts across the phylogeny; estimate rates of phenotypic and molecular evolution relative to transitions (biogeographic and ecological) and shifts in lineage diversification rate; test for correlations between the tempos of phenotypic and molecular evolution; and, quantify morphological and molecular convergence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Savannah State University focuses on mathematical modeling for the identification of heat conductivity coefficients of two-phase materials and provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their education through research experiences in mathematical modeling. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at Purdue University. <br/><br/>One of the central issues of the contemporary mechanics of continuous media is the problem of identification of the mechanical properties of particulate two-phase materials and flows based on the respective properties of the constituents. This project will investigate the problem of identifying one such mechanical property, namely, effective heat conductivity.  The particulate material (or suspension of particles in a fluid, such as a liquid-solid mixture) can be conceptualized as a particulate ""phase"" comprised of randomly dispersed particles throughout a continuous ""phase"". The presence of suspended particles strongly influences the overall mechanical properties. This phenomenon remains a major challenge in the field of fluid mechanics especially while estimating the effective transport coefficients, such as the heat conductivity coefficient or the viscosity coefficient, of suspensions. The long-term goal is the estimation of the effective heat conductivity coefficient for suspension by developing an in-depth mathematical model. This model will be based on a system of stochastic differential equations. This system will be recovered from the steady and unsteady heat diffusion equations by applying a method called random point approximations - also, expanding the temperature field by using a suitable stochastic functional series. In this process, the model will be fully capable of countering the problems associated with the randomness of sizes and positions of the suspended particles in a continuous media. Furthermore, it will also be able to tackle the significant issue of inhomogeneity interactions which is strongly validated by experimental data. Once developed, this model will lead to a mathematically rigorous formula for effective heat conductivity coefficient of suspension, improving Maxwell's formula for terms up to the square of concentration of the suspension. The expected outcomes will also improve our understanding of the mechanism and theory that underlies this phenomenon which will subsequently extend design options in manufacturing devices and developing processes applicable to these mechanisms, therefore opening the door to possibilities of novel processes and devices that use heat transfer and fluid flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adaptive radiations are the most dramatic and well-known examples of evolution.  They are also often thought to be one of the most important causes of the diversity of life on Earth, but they have only been well documented in a small number of cases. This project will reveal how important natural selection may have been in the adaptive radiation of mammals. It will help develop new methods to study the degree of influence of natural selection in evolutionary history. Understanding how predictable natural selection has been would allow a much better understanding of many features of a species, from its biochemistry to its morphology. Teasing apart the relative roles of adaptation and inherited traits will improve the efficiency of any research that compares different species, such as biomedical studies, using mice, rats, or other species, to understand human health. This project will also help train the next generation of scientists, from high school to graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. Three-dimensional images of hundreds of species will be posted online and made available to other researchers to use in their studies. These images will provide a valuable source of data for scientists and will be a valuable educational tool for teachers and students.<br/><br/>This project will test whether one of the most important diversification events in mammals, the taxon Oryzomyalia, a group of over 350 rodent species that descended from a single colonization of South America 7-10 million years ago, was an adaptive radiation.

Ice melt probes use electrical energy to descend through thick ice with little support structure on the ice surface. We are extending previous technology by using anti-freeze to maintain a partially open melt-hole above a descending probe, deploying as we go a new a new fiber-optic technology to measure ice temperature. Ice temperature measurements will reveal spatial patterns of heat welling up from the Earth beneath the ice, which in turn will contribute greatly to finding ancient ice that contains global climate records, and to understanding how ice flow may raise sea levels.  Our immediate objective in this 1-year project is to test and refine our anti-freeze-based method in a 15 meter-tall ice column at the University of Wisconsin, so as to reduce technical risk in future field tests.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The overarching aim of our development is to enable widespread, spatially dense deployments of instruments within and beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet for a variety of investigations, beginning with observations of basal temperature and geothermal flux at the base of the ice sheet. Dense, widespread deployment requires logistical costs far below current costs for ice drilling and coring. Our approach is to extend ice melt probe technology (which is inherently light, logistically) to allow the progressive deployment of cable for Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) from the ice surface as the probe descends, without greatly increasing logistical costs. Our extension is based on arresting refreezing of the melt-hole above the probe (at a diameter a few times the cable diameter) by injecting anti-freeze - specifically, ethanol at temperature near 0C - a few meters above the probe during descent. After thermal equilibration of the liquid ethanol/water column with the ice, DTS measurements yield the depth-profile of ice sheet temperature, from which basal temperature and (over frozen beds) geothermal flux can be inferred. We have carried out initial trials of our approach in a cold-room laboratory, but field work based only on such small-scale tests may still involve unnecessary risk. We therefore propose further testing at a facility of the Ice Drilling Design and Operations (IDDO) facility in Madison, WI. The new trials will test our approaches to melt-hole control and probe recovery in the taller column, will test cable and cable-tension-management methods more nearly approximating those needed to work on ice sheets, and will demonstrate the Distributed Temperature Sensing in its field configuration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The efficiency of this solar antenna is remarkable, and it is perhaps one of Nature's most spectacular molecular architectures.  While the light-harvesting complex has been studied extensively, the origin of its high efficiency has remained a mystery.  The problem is challenging. The light-harvesting complex not only consists of many individual molecules, but the structure is not rigid, and the molecular components are continually moving. The role that this motion plays in facilitating (or impeding) energy transport is unclear.  Through support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Eisele at The City College of New York (CCNY) is studying bio-inspired nanomaterials to elucidate Nature?s secret to efficient energy transport. Working together, Professor Eisele and her students are synthesizing new nanostructured molecular assemblies that mimic the features of the Nature's light-harvesting complex. They then watch the flow of energy through the assembly using sophisticated near-field scanning optical microscopies with the goal of understanding how structural fluctuations affect energy transport. The project could profoundly impact our understanding of natural photosynthetic systems, and could pave the way towards the design of efficient artificial systems for solar energy conversion applications.  In addition, the project is training the next generation of scientists in a broad range fields including nanoscience, spectroscopy and optical microscopy.  Through outreach activities, Professor Eisele and her students are working with middle- and high-school students, many from historically underrepresented minority groups, to produce short videos that highlight the challenges and opportunities of nanoscience, from everyday applications to the latest research in super-high resolution nanoimaging.<br/><br/>Conceptually, achieving a better understanding of excitation energy transfer (EET) processes in bio-inspired nanomaterials requires model systems that allow thorough testing of current theoretical models of energy transport phenomena. To this end, Professor Eisele is synthesizing well-defined model systems based on monomers such as amphiphilic cyanine dyes and porphyrin dyes. In solution the monomers self-assemble into supramolecular nanotubes that show collective optical properties (excitons) similar to the optical properties found in natural light-harvesting complexes. The nanotube assemblies are then encapsulated in transparent (non-excitonic) materials to mimic the surrounding proteins of the natural light-harvesting complex. The structural and optical properties of individual nanotubes are studied using near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) techniques, and the EET process is followed using femtosecond pump-probe techniques. The project is also integrating the pump-probe spectroscopies with NSOM methods, to enable direct observation of energy transport in an individual structure. The experimental results are complemented with Monte Carlo computer simulations of the supramolecular structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Avian brood parasites, birds that provide no parental care to their offspring but instead lay their eggs in the nests of other species, represent an ideal model system for comparative analysis because brood parasitism (and the loss of parental care behavior) evolved independently seven times in five different avian families. This project will characterize patterns of genomic change in both parasitic and non-parasitic birds to test whether changes in the same specific genes and/or parallel patterns of genomic change have occurred in independent brood parasitic lineages. The results will also provide insight into other fundamental questions about genome evolution, including whether genetic changes underlying differences in behavior are most often in regulatory portions of the genome or represent structural changes to the genes themselves. In a second, related line of inquiry, the project will examine the unique evolutionary dynamics of the sex-determination chromosomes, leveraging recent research showing that specialized adaptations for exploiting particular host species are maternally inherited (passed from mother to daughter) and therefore encoded on the avian W-chromosome (analogous to the human Y-chromosome) in three different brood parasitic species. The project will also contribute to the training of scientists at various career stages including undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow. A research experience for undergraduates (REU) component will provide an opportunity for two students from East Carolina University to receive training in bioinformatics at Harvard University. The project will produce high quality genome assemblies for additional bird species, supporting additional comparative analyses of genome evolution across vertebrates, and data from the project will be integrated into educational materials supporting courses in the emerging fields of molecular and population genomics.<br/><br/>Avian brood parasites and their hosts, which exhibit a spectacular diversity of behavioral, morphological and physiological adaptations and counter-adaptations, have served as important models for the study of coevolution. Recent discoveries of genetically divergent, host-specific matrilines within each of three different parasitic species, examples of ""adaptation without recombination"", present a unique opportunity to examine the effects of selection on the non-recombining, sex-limited chromosome. Likewise, with seven independent origins of obligate parasitism and associated loss of parental care, brood parasites offer an unparalleled opportunity to explore the genome-wide consequences of a major life history transition, providing greater power for tests of genomic convergence than in other recent analyses of the genomic basis of phenotypic convergence. Results of the study will lend insight into basic questions about genome evolution, including the relative importance of determinism versus historical contingency, and the manner in which integration versus modularity of genetic networks constrains the outcomes of natural selection. In addition to increasing the number of high quality genome assemblies for birds (currently available for only zebra finch and chicken) and assembling W-chromosome sequences, the proposed study will test two major hypotheses: 1) that evolutionary processes influencing the non-recombining, sex-limited W-chromosome (e.g., Hill-Robertson interference, selective sweeps, genetic hitchhiking) are amplified in parasitic lineages that have maternally inherited host-specific adaptations; and 2) examining all seven parasitic clades, that the evolution of brood parasitism (and loss of parental care behavior) results in genome-wide signatures of molecular convergence and/or convergent changes in coding and/or regulatory regions associated with particular genetic pathways or functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has resulted in significant milkweed replanting efforts by national initiatives and local enthusiasts. While meritorious in its conception, these replanting efforts tend to use a variety of milkweed species that can vary dramatically in their level of toxicity to Monarch larvae. Moreover, it is unknown how exposure to such varying levels of toxicity as larvae may affect the ability of surviving adult Monarch butterflies to establish viable populations and migrate to Mexican overwintering sites. Using NSF funding and leveraging a large-scale collaborative network of Monarch scientists, the researchers will quantify such effects by examining milkweed-Monarch interactions throughout their life history, under both controlled laboratory- and natural settings. In addition to Monarchs, this project will generally inform habitat restoration efforts aimed at offsetting population declines in other beneficial insects, as consequences of larval dietary history for adult traits important to population health are poorly understood in most insects.<br/><br/>Chemical ecology research on plant-insect herbivore interactions has abundantly focused on the proximate effects of plant defenses and toxicity on insect larval stages. Since insect larvae tend to cause most damage to plants, this focus makes sense, but as a result only limited information is available on indirect, i.e., beyond the larval stages, effects of host plant toxicity on adult insect traits important for population growth and dispersal. The proposed work will address this gap in knowledge by linking variation in plant defense biochemistry experienced by larvae to adult insect fitness outcomes. Using the iconic Monarch butterfly as a focal species, the PIs aim to quantify how variation in toxic traits among ten milkweed species (i.e., Monarch host plants) affect larval growth, adult fecundity and migratory ability, in laboratory and natural contexts. To achieve this aim, they will use an integrative approach that combines state-of-the-art methods in chemical ecology, organismal energetics, biomechanics, and leverage a citizen science driven collaboration with several laboratories located along the annual Monarch's migration routes. This work is pertinent to the focal species as replanting efforts aimed at restoring suitable habitat to combat Monarch population declines use multiple milkweed species without consideration for how larval exposure to varying milkweed defensive chemistry affects Monarch population dynamics and migration. In parallel, this project will generally inform science and habitat restoration efforts aimed at offsetting population declines in other beneficial insects, as consequences of larval dietary history for adult traits are poorly understood in most insects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are essential for animal life. With advances in DNA sequencing it has recently been shown that some individuals may possess multiple, distinct lineages of mitochondria in their cells.  This suggests that the presence of multiple types of mitochondria, a condition known as heteroplasmy, may be an integral part of the evolution of many species.  This finding is very surprising, because mitochondria, almost always are inherited from the mother only, and in humans, heteroplasmy has been linked to severe genetic disease. From an evolutionary perspective, the presence of more than one type of mitochondria in an individual may have an important function in generating genetic diversity.  It is likely that the presence of multiple types of mitochondria presents opportunities to exchange genes between different mitochondrial lineages. Despite growing recognition of the potential significance of heteroplasmy, this aspect of animal evolution remains poorly understood. This project aims to address key questions relating to how heteroplasmy is generated, how long it can be maintained, and whether genes are exchanged between mitochondrial lineages. The bed bug will be used as a model species for these studies because it exhibits unusually high levels of heteroplasmy. Experiments to resolve these questions have the potential to fundamentally change how we look at genetic inheritance of mitochondrial DNA in animals. The project will include training of undergraduate and post-doctoral scholars, the establishment of a collaborative network of researchers and pest control operators, and public outreach in both Oklahoma and North Carolina. Furthermore, given that the bed bug is a significant public health concern, establishing it as a model system will continue to bring them to public attention, reinforcing awareness of the species.<br/><br/>While uniparental inheritance appears to predominate in the animal kingdom, the growing evidence of heteroplasmy through paternal leakage and compelling recent evidence of mtDNA recombination, underscores that while we have developed a great understanding of mitochondrial function and evolution, our understanding of mitochondrial inheritance is far from complete. The bed bug, Cimex lectularius, is an ectoparasite that has seen an unprecedented resurgence in recent years. Studies have revealed that it exhibits high levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy, which is both pervasive and rapidly generated. Furthermore, mtDNA recombination appears common. Given the suitability and tractability of this species as a model system, this study will: (1) Address how intra- and inter-population genetic characteristics correlate with rates of heteroplasmy; (2) Investigate the degree to which mitogenomic divergence and mitonuclear interactions affect the rate of paternal leakage; (3) Empirically and theoretically examine heteroplasmy decay in a species where it is common and pervasive and for which genetic drift vs. selection may be evaluated; and (4) Take a complete mitogenomic approach to investigate recombination and the presence of recombination hotspots. Due to the high rate of leakage and recombination seen in the bed bug in concert with recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and analytical methods, this system offers a unique opportunity to address this hotly debated and evolutionarily consequential question.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These 'chiral' chemicals play a central role in living-organisms, where only the left- or right-handed forms are present; but not both. As a result, most biologically active molecules, such as pharmaceuticals, must also be chiral molecules, and they must match the handedness of the biochemicals found in life.  However, producing enantiomerically pure forms of molecules is a challenging problem. In this collaborative research project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism A (CSDM-A) program of the National Science Foundation Division of Chemistry, Professors Andrew Gellman (Carnegie Mellon University) and Charles Sykes (Tufts University) are studying the chemistry of chiral molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces where the atomic structure also has a specific handedness.  Working with their students, Professors Gellman and Sykes are developing curved metal surfaces that present a systematic variation in chiral structures. The designed surfaces enable the study of many atomic configurations with a single sample.  Sophisticated spectroscopies map the chemical reactivity across the surface, while isolated chemical reactions are observed using a high-resolution microscope that can map the positions of individual atoms. In addition to providing training opportunities for future scientists, insights gained from the project could guide the design of surfaces for enantiospecific production of chiral chemicals in the pharmaceutical industry.  <br/><br/>The research targets the surface chemistry of two chiral compounds, tartaric acid (TA) and aspartic acid (Asp), on chiral Cu(hkl) surfaces.  Single crystal Cu surfaces are polished into spherical shapes such that each point on the surface of the sphere exposes a plane with a different atomic structure.  This makes it very efficient to study the adsorption and surface reactions of TA and Asp on all possible structures of a Cu surface; i.e. all possible Miller indices (hkl).  The atomic structures of these surfaces are imaged with and without adsorbed TA and Asp using scanning tunneling microscopy.  Independent measurements of TA and Asp decomposition kinetics are made on hundreds of different Cu(hkl) surfaces, all on a single sample.  These data elucidate surface reaction rate constants as a function of surface orientation, ks(hkl), and hence enable an understanding of the effect of surface structure on chemical and enantiospecific reactivity.  Combined, these data are used to identify those surface orientations with the highest enantioselectivities towards decomposition of the two enantiomers of TA and Asp.  Imaging with the scanning tunneling microscope is then used to determine the atomic structure of the surfaces having greatest enantioselectivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A research experience for undergraduates (REU) component will provide an opportunity for two students from East Carolina University to receive training in bioinformatics at Harvard University. The project will produce high quality genome assemblies for additional bird species, supporting additional comparative analyses of genome evolution across vertebrates, and data from the project will be integrated into educational materials supporting courses in the emerging fields of molecular and population genomics.<br/><br/>Avian brood parasites and their hosts, which exhibit a spectacular diversity of behavioral, morphological and physiological adaptations and counter-adaptations, have served as important models for the study of coevolution. Recent discoveries of genetically divergent, host-specific matrilines within each of three different parasitic species, examples of ""adaptation without recombination"", present a unique opportunity to examine the effects of selection on the non-recombining, sex-limited chromosome. Likewise, with seven independent origins of obligate parasitism and associated loss of parental care, brood parasites offer an unparalleled opportunity to explore the genome-wide consequences of a major life history transition, providing greater power for tests of genomic convergence than in other recent analyses of the genomic basis of phenotypic convergence. Results of the study will lend insight into basic questions about genome evolution, including the relative importance of determinism versus historical contingency, and the manner in which integration versus modularity of genetic networks constrains the outcomes of natural selection. In addition to increasing the number of high quality genome assemblies for birds (currently available for only zebra finch and chicken) and assembling W-chromosome sequences, the proposed study will test two major hypotheses: 1) that evolutionary processes influencing the non-recombining, sex-limited W-chromosome (e.g., Hill-Robertson interference, selective sweeps, genetic hitchhiking) are amplified in parasitic lineages that have maternally inherited host-specific adaptations; and 2) examining all seven parasitic clades, that the evolution of brood parasitism (and loss of parental care behavior) results in genome-wide signatures of molecular convergence and/or convergent changes in coding and/or regulatory regions associated with particular genetic pathways or functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While adaptive radiation is a common theme in the evolution of life, many of its features are poorly understood. This project seeks to better understand how adaptive radiation proceeds. The project will examine the rate of diversification in genes, morphology and species diversity over the evolutionary history of a group of rodents containing more than 600 species. The study will determine how changes in genes, morphology and species are correlated as the species diversified.

This study will place these model organisms in an evolutionary context that will allow scientists to better understand how their genes and other characteristics have evolved. Such understanding provides new insight into genes and characteristics of medical significance. Scientific meetings organized by the researchers will bring together scientists who study mice and rats from different perspectives, including molecular biology and medicine, to share insight and generate new research questions. In addition to the broader impacts on basic science and medicine, public outreach and education events at participating natural history museums will use the results of this research to teach principles of evolutionary biology to K-12 students and improve public understanding of science.<br/><br/>This project integrates comparative genomics with quantitative morphology in a rigorous phylogenetic framework to illuminate the dynamics of diversification in lineages, phenotypes, and genes across the most species-rich adaptive radiation in mammals.

Symbiosis is a major force of evolutionary change, influencing virtually all aspects of biology, ranging from population ecology and evolution to genomics and molecular/biochemical mechanisms of development and reproduction.  Understanding the nature and mechanisms of these associations is thus of interest from many perspectives.  The most common symbiotic bacteria in the world are called Wolbachia, present in up to 70% of insects and other arthropods such as spiders, mites and crustaceans and also in roundworms causing human diseases of river blindness and elephantiasis and heartworm in domesticated animals. For all these scientific endeavors, we need to more fully understand how Wolbachia are able to influence their hosts' biology, their interactions with their ecology and environment and their biology in natural populations. It is here that the 10th biennial international Wolbachia (Wolbachia2018) meeting enables interactions from multiple scientific perspectives and approaches.  Over 100 of the world's experts on Wolbachia (and related symbionts) from academia and industry gather to present and discuss their recent findings.  The small, informal nature of the meetings enables involvement of graduate students, postdocs, scientists in the beginning of their careers, and participation of under-represented groups in science, providing opportunities for them to present their work. The multidisciplinary nature of research interests of participants fosters interactions from diverse fields of biology bringing together participants who likely would not be able to meet as a group at other conferences due to their individual disciplines. <br/><br/>The obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacteria symbiont Wolbachia, widespread in arthropods, is best known for reproductive manipulation to enhance transmission through the female germline, leading to cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, feminization or male-killing. Wolbachia alter core host cellular and developmental processes and also have a dramatic impact on the composition of insect gut microbiome.  They can protect their arthropod hosts against insect viruses and can benefit their hosts under times of nutritional stress and they can influence human pathogenic levels in mosquito vectors of malaria, Zika, Dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever viruses.  It is possible to drive and maintain anti-pathogen strains of Wolbachia in mosquitoes in natural populations, enabling a reduction of the frequency and titer of these viral pathogens. Wolbachia are also present in most human filarial nematodes which cause parasitic diseases of elephantiasis and river blindness. Here they are obligate for worm development and reproduction, triggering worldwide projects screening for anti-Wolbachia drugs. The 10th biennial Wolbachia conference is focused around topics including: reproductive manipulation (cytoplasmic incompatibility and other mechanisms); cell biology; genomics, biochemistry and molecular biology; Wolbachia as tools and targets of disease/pest control in insects and filariae; facultative symbiont diversity, ecology and evolution; sex-ratio distortion systems and other symbiont species in arthropods.  The meeting will promote the latest research findings about mechanisms driving these core host cellular and development processes and provide insight into the evolutionary origins of the intracellular lifestyle of endosymbionts and many pathogens.  Presentations by graduate students, postdocs and beginning scientists and under-represented groups is encouraged.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It influences how DNA is inherited from one generation to the next. Organisms actually have many different ways of reproducing.  It is unclear why the most common should involve genetic contributions from two parents (bi-parental reproduction) as opposed to one (uni-parental reproduction). One important consequence of bi-parental reproduction is that it produces more genetically variable offspring.  Why this is an advantage, however, is unclear.  One possibility is that genetically variable offspring are more likely to escape infection from parasites and diseases that have adapted to the parents' genetic make-up. Another is that the genetic variability is helpful more generally for adaptation to changing environments. This project uses the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which can reproduce either uni- or bi-parentally, along with its bacterial parasite, Serratia marcescens, to experimentally test these ideas.  The project will also contribute to teaching and training students at many levels, providing opportunities for them to learn scientific methods in a hands-on fashion. It will integrate research with education in undergraduate teaching labs and will include developing and implementing new teaching laboratory classes. It will also train graduate students. Finally, it will include an outreach program that will bring hypothesis testing science to a neighborhood with many young children from underrepresented groups in science. <br/><br/>The questions of both how and why bi-parental reproduction is maintained in nature largely remain a mystery in evolutionary biology. Currently, the Red Queen hypothesis (RQH) is the most well supported hypothesis regarding the evolution and maintenance of outcrossing. The central prediction of the RQH is that negative frequency-dependent selection, imposed by coevolving parasites, favors reproduction via outcrossing over self-fertilization in host populations. Although a rapidly growing number of studies demonstrate the ability of coevolving parasites to favor host outcrossing over host self-fertilization, the mode of selection imposed by coevolving parasites, and in general, the coevolutionary dynamics between outcrossing hosts and their respective parasites remain unclear. Here, the fundamental predictions of the RQH will be comprehensively tested in perhaps the only experimental system currently capable of permitting such a test. Specifically, the host, Caenorhabditis elegans, and parasite, Serratia marcescens, populations will be experimentally evolved to determine if coevolving parasites are necessary for the evolution and maintenance of outcrossing, or if only a dynamic changing environment is required. After which, the phenotypic and underlying genetic changes in the hosts and parasites, as well as the mode (or modes) of selection that result from antagonistic coevolution, will be determined through a combination of phenotypic assays, next-generation sequencing, functional genetic testing via transformation, and subsequent experimental evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The problem is challenging, however, due to the wide range of reactant energies, and the many different atomic structures found on a working catalyst. To unravel this complexity, Professor Utz and his students are preparing reactants with precise quantities of energy. They then measure their reactivity on a series of surfaces containing well-defined structures that resemble the features present on a working catalyst. The work is providing a systematic and quantitative understanding of how reactant energy, and surface structure, lead to catalytic activity. Insights gained from the project could advance our ability to design and optimize catalysts, which could have important benefits to society.  The project is also training students in advanced experimental methods and interfacial science, and it is providing outreach activities that stimulate interest, and enrich the K-12 Science and Technology curriculum at local schools.  <br/><br/>The project focuses on the energetics and dynamics of dissociative chemisorption to build a mechanistic picture of catalytic activity. A key goal is to understand how increasing the structural and chemical complexity of the gas phase reagent and the surface affects reactivity. A supersonic molecular beam and infrared laser, respectively, impart reactant molecules with a precisely defined kinetic and internal energy. Metal surfaces are chosen to systematically introduce structural features characteristic of working catalysts. Molecular beam reflectivity and surface-sensitive spectroscopies quantify reaction probability as a function of reagent's translational, vibrational, and rotational energies, as well as the surface structure and temperature. In concert with collaborators' electronic structure and reactive scattering calculations, the results paint a detailed picture of the underlying processes that govern gas-surface reactivity and reveal how reactivity patterns persist or change as complexity increases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The islands of the Galapagos vary in age from young (less than 50,000 years old) to old (more than 4 million years old). This range in age can be used to study how biological diversity is shaped when communities are simple with few interacting species (on young islands), and when communities are more complex and characterized by numerous biological interactions (on older islands). This project will measure the rate at which new species are formed and diversity accumulates across a group of approximately 80 species of land snails forming the Galapagos's largest proliferation of species diversity. A combination of field and laboratory studies will be used to understand how the rate of evolution is influenced by the complexity of natural selection. A course for undergraduate students at the University of Idaho will introduce students to biodiversity patterns and guide them through the underlying evolutionary core principles generating these patterns using a series of field research excursions in the Pacific Northwest that is analogous to the Galapagos research expeditions. Students will also follow Galapagos research via Adventure Learning capsules (videos and integrated teaching material) which will guide and inspire them in the development of their own local research projects. Outreach activities also include developing a bilingual English-Spanish guidebook of Galapagos terrestrial snails, presentations and workshops for Galapagos park rangers, staff scientists, and guides, and disseminating research results in scientific publications, textbooks, magazines and the popular press.<br/><br/>Islands are living laboratories where evolutionary change is clear, tangible, and can be directly observed. On Galapagos, the number of selection pressures increases from young to old islands as species assemble in more diverse and complex communities. Although substantial research efforts have been devoted to quantify selection in simple environments, there is a need to characterize the effects and interactions of multiple selection pressures in complex natural biological systems, and the proposed work will fill this gap. The project will characterize variation in morphological and physiological traits of snails and quantify variation in multiple environmental factors for the approximately 80 Galapagos endemic land snail species of the genus Naesiotus and their mainland relatives. Species-level phylogenetic history of the lineage will be reconstructed to determine the number of independent colonization events that led to the diversity of Galapagos Naesiotus snails, and put the phenotype-environment association analyses in a phylogenetically-informed framework. The data will then be used to address hypotheses related to the effects of multiple selection pressures (i.e., increased complexity) on the rate of phenotypic change and adaptation in this lineage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This specialization is driven by the need for parasites to efficiently encounter and infect at least some hosts, which often comes at the cost of being able to infect others. At a broad-scale, parasite species adapt to a particular set of host species. At a finer-scale, many parasite strains specialize at overcoming the defenses of a narrow range of host genotypes within a species. There is little understanding of how evolutionary processes of host and parasite adaptation at the fine scale are linked to the evolution of parasite host ranges at broader scales, in part because few host-parasite systems are amenable to research at both scales. In this project the researchers will capitalize on a natural, ancient host-parasite system that allows for molecular investigation of parasite specialization at multiple scales. Escovopsis is a diverse genus of parasitic fungus that attacks other fungi cultivated by fungus-growing ants. Different Escovopsis species are able to infect different species of cultivated fungi, and at a finer scale, different Escovopsis genotypes are able to infect and utilize different host genotypes. Such parasite specificity suggests a dynamic pattern of adaptation and provides a rare opportunity to identify traits underlying parasite specialization at multiple scales. As part of this project, classes of undergraduate students will study parasite evolution through investigation of the parasites' host ranges and the parasites' genomes, and middle school students will learn about parasite evolution through an integrated science and art approach. <br/><br/>Building on existing knowledge of Escovopsis diversity and host range, as well as recently gained insights into the Escovopsis genome, the researchers will couple experimental assays of parasite-host interactions, transcriptomics, population genomics and genetic manipulation to explore the genetic underpinnings of pathogen specialization. Specifically, the researchers will utilize transcriptomics and functional assays to identify the gene underlying the parasites' responses to host strains that they can and cannot infect. They will study the evolution of these genes in light of the evolution of the rest of the parasite genome through genomic comparisons across species and across strains within species. Taken together, the researchers will be able to assess whether similar traits underlie parasite specialization at broad and fine evolutionary scales in a tractable, ancient host-parasite system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our aim is to enable dense, widespread measurement-networks by advancing development of low-cost ice melt probe technology to deploy instruments. Ice melt probes use electrical energy to descend through thick ice with little support structure on the ice surface. We are extending previous technology by using anti-freeze to maintain a partially open melt-hole above a descending probe, deploying as we go a new a new fiber-optic technology to measure ice temperature. Ice temperature measurements will reveal spatial patterns of heat welling up from the Earth beneath the ice, which in turn will contribute greatly to finding ancient ice that contains global climate records, and to understanding how ice flow may raise sea levels.  Our immediate objective in this 1-year project is to test and refine our anti-freeze-based method in a 15 meter-tall ice column at the University of Wisconsin, so as to reduce technical risk in future field tests.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The overarching aim of our development is to enable widespread, spatially dense deployments of instruments within and beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet for a variety of investigations, beginning with observations of basal temperature and geothermal flux at the base of the ice sheet. Dense, widespread deployment requires logistical costs far below current costs for ice drilling and coring. Our approach is to extend ice melt probe technology (which is inherently light, logistically) to allow the progressive deployment of cable for Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) from the ice surface as the probe descends, without greatly increasing logistical costs. Our extension is based on arresting refreezing of the melt-hole above the probe (at a diameter a few times the cable diameter) by injecting anti-freeze - specifically, ethanol at temperature near 0C - a few meters above the probe during descent. After thermal equilibration of the liquid ethanol/water column with the ice, DTS measurements yield the depth-profile of ice sheet temperature, from which basal temperature and (over frozen beds) geothermal flux can be inferred. We have carried out initial trials of our approach in a cold-room laboratory, but field work based only on such small-scale tests may still involve unnecessary risk. We therefore propose further testing at a facility of the Ice Drilling Design and Operations (IDDO) facility in Madison, WI. The new trials will test our approaches to melt-hole control and probe recovery in the taller column, will test cable and cable-tension-management methods more nearly approximating those needed to work on ice sheets, and will demonstrate the Distributed Temperature Sensing in its field configuration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their applications range from catalyzing slow chemical reactions to exhibiting unusual magnetic properties that can used for quantum computing. Despite the technological importance of transition metals, theoretical methods to calculate their properties are much less developed than for organic molecules, where high-accuracy calculations can be performed that rival the accuracy of experiments. This shortcoming can be traced to the intricate interplay between correlated electronic motion and the impacts of relativity, both of which are much more important for transition metals than for organic molecules. Dr. Sharma is working to fill this void by developing a suite of methods to treat metal-containing systems. Predictive, accurate calculations on transition metal systems using these methods can direct experimental efforts in designing efficient and cheap biomimetic catalysts as well help design the next generation of systems for quantum computing.  Dr. Sharma is also developing a course to improve the mathematical skills of undergraduate chemists, which is a critical need for young chemists.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Sharma is developing ab initio methods that can reliably be used for transition metal-containing relativistic systems, that also display strong electron correlation.

However, treating them simultaneously on an equal footing remains a formidable challenge. A major goal of Dr. Sharma's research is the fruitful cross-fertilization of the latest ideas in the two fields in order to develop algorithms that allow the treatment of strongly correlated relativistic systems. More specifically, he is developing methods that: (i) Calculate the ground and low-lying excited states of the fully relativistic four-component Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian for small benchmark systems containing heavy atoms, that are inaccessible by exact diagonalization, to near-exact accuracy. (ii) Implement near-exact diagonalization as an active space method to obtain a quantitatively accurate method for treating large systems of interest in biology and material science.

This grant extends the ""naturalness of code"" theory by studying how the code lexicon evolves in open source software as different developers work on a software project and features are added, modified, deleted.  The goal is to learn the extent to which the evolution of a developer's lexicon follows the laws of natural language evolution.<br/><br/>To create the needed demonstration, large datasets of code lexicons are being collected from a large number of OSS projects and their revisions (on GitHub and SourceForge).

Part of the challenge is to better understand how events that instigate code evolution, such as maintenance activities and team formation, are fundamentally different from the events that instigate change in natural language, such as war and migration. The research should lead to new ways to predict software project outcomes and to improve software productivity and quality.

In addition to the scholarships, students will receive faculty and peer mentoring, have access to targeted advising, and participate in summer research opportunities. Each of the partner institutions will also redesign STEM courses in which students often struggle, so that the courses emphasize student-centered learning.

High impact supports include faculty mentoring/advising intended to increase successful transfer to the biology major at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, and co-curricular activities such as contact with faculty and peer mentors from UNCC. Once they have transferred to University of North Carolina, Charlotte, scholarship students will benefit academically from co-enrolling in sections of required courses, including organic chemistry and calculus, in which biology majors have historically struggled. To support their success, scholarship students in these courses will have access to peer mentors who have received training about how to address transfer student issues.

RNA delivery to tumors is a long-standing problem whose solution has exceptional promise, as RNA can suppress the expression of target genes that facilitate tumor growth. This project will package RNA inside polymeric nanoparticles, which are then ""cloaked"" with membranes derived from cancer cells, in order to hide the nanoparticles from the immune system and enable specific recognition of tumor cells inside the body. This project will generate the nanoparticles, characterize their material properties, and evaluate their cell-specific and tumor-specific RNA delivery capabilities. For emerging technologies like this to be successfully implemented in the future, a new generation of scientists must be trained how to develop and analyze innovative bio-nanomaterials. Accordingly, this project's educational goal is to create a comprehensive program spanning the K-12, college, and graduate levels that will increase students' exposure to the field and increase the pipeline of students, particularly women and minorities, pursuing careers in bio-nanotechnology. These efforts include the development of a new college course module about membrane-wrapped nanoparticles, the creation of demonstrations about bio-nanomaterials for use in K-12 outreach, and the in-depth training of high school and undergraduate students in bio-nanomaterials via research internships. By integrating the proposed research with these programs and targeting a large and diverse audience, this project will enable the next generation of workers in the field to create innovative solutions to grand challenges at the interface of nanotechnology, biology, materials science, and medicine.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL <br/>This project will develop cancer cell membrane-wrapped nanoparticles (CCNPs) for targeted RNA delivery to tumors. The use of membrane cloaks to disguise nanoparticles from the immune system and enable tumor-specific delivery is at the forefront of modern cellular engineering, nanotechnology, and materials science, yet the features of these systems that are essential for their application in RNA interference remain unknown. While prior work has shown that covering synthetic nanoparticles with membrane coatings improves systemic delivery of hydrophobic drugs, the ability to provide targeted delivery of hydrophilic RNA cargos, as this project aims to do, has not yet been realized. This project will develop CCNPs for RNA delivery through three aims, which are to: (1) Synthesize CCNPs carrying RNA cargo and characterize their material properties and payload release; (2) Determine how the size and membrane composition of CCNPs influence their ability to engage cell receptors to mediate uptake and RNA payload delivery, and; (3) Demonstrate the homotypic targeting of CCNPs carrying RNA cargo both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these aims will advance fundamental knowledge of CCNP technology and produce a new platform that may improve the study and treatment of cancer. This project will also integrate this research into educational activities in order to inspire and prepare students for careers in STEM and bio-nanotechnology. The educational aims are to: (1) Create a new module about ""membrane-wrapped nanoparticles for cargo delivery"" for the Engineering Biomedical Nanostructures (EBN) course in the engineering curriculum; (2) Work with students in the EBN course to develop bio-nanomaterials demos for use in K-12 outreach facilitated by the University of Delaware Lending Library, and; (3) Engage high school and undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM in bio-nanomaterials research via internships.

This award will fund an additional year of that effort and will maintain this momentum in technique development to complete the analysis of proof-of-concept projects on vast waveform data sets, and to deploy the cyberinfrastructure for wider use by the seismological community.<br/><br/>The premise of the research is that continuous and/or densely recorded data coupled with high performance computing and scalable algorithms can enable a network-based approach to earthquake detection that greatly improves the detection of weak and unusual events that would be difficult or impossible to detect using traditional approaches. Numerous seismological observations confirm that proximal earthquake sources generate similar signals. Exploiting the discriminative power of this similarity has led to many fundamental discoveries; however, most similarity-based detection methods require prior knowledge of the source waveform, or template. Blind/uninformed search for signals having unknown signatures based on pair-wise or multiple matches has seen some success, but nave implementations of this approach suffer from quadratic scaling of computation with time such that problems of interest are inaccessible  even for the most capable computers. Similarly, for dense networks, the availability of continuous waveform data motivates alternative detection schemes based on waveform similarity at adjacent stations. This project will further develop efficient data-mining techniques to enable scalable similarity search of seismic wavefields. Technical challenges to be addressed as part of the research for spatially sparse recording are to develop improved similarity-preserving compression for repeating signals detected over a network, and to improve post-processing of search output that will both isolate signals of seismological interest and minimize false detections. For spatially dense recording, this would extend recently developed wavefield matching techniques to similarity across adjacent stations, which would enable similarity search across unaliased elastic wavefields in four dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For scientific results generated through computation to be considered robust and become widely accepted, the computational techniques should be automated, reproducible and trustworthy. By exploring the practices of gravitational-wave astronomy researchers working on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project, this project seeks to create a set of case studies documenting broadly applicable methods for reproducible computational science. Specifically, the project will explore and articulate what reproducibility, automation, and trust mean with respect to computation-based research in gravitational-wave astronomy, identify, implement and validate a set of experimental practices, that will include computational techniques, and finally, evaluate how these experimental practices can be extended to other science domains. <br/><br/>Robust computational science builds on rigorous methods and is composed of three key elements: (1) reproducibility, which enables the verification and leveraging of scientists' findings; (2) automation, which speeds up the exploration of alternative solutions and the processing of large amounts of data while reducing the introduction of errors; and (3) trust, providing security and reliability for software and data, while supplying the necessary attributes for confidence in the scientist's own results and results from others. This project explores robust science in the LIGO project through the following activities within the context of gravitational-wave astronomy: (1) articulating the roles of reproducibility, automation, and trust in gravitational-wave astronomy; (2) identifying, implementing and validating a set of experimental practices, including computational techniques; and (3) advancing towards the project's vision of general computational methods for robust science by evaluating how the experimental practices can be extended to other science domains. The project will develop and use a survey to collect information about LIGO workflows that are composed of a series of experimental, computational, and data manipulation steps. The analysis of the survey will result in a document that describes what reproducibility means in the LIGO context and help identify potential improvements in LIGO's practices. The project will generalize these findings by documenting a mapping of LIGOs original and enhanced approach to other science workflows including those of the molecular dynamics and bioinformatics communities. The final project document will target a broad audience that includes researchers and students at various levels of education, with the goal of introducing them to the concept of robust computational research, and the underlying concepts of reproducibility, automation and trust, teaching them to access code, data, and workflow information to regenerate findings, learn about the scientific methods, and to engage in STEM research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Damage to urban forests was widespread. Many trees were uprooted or lost leaves and limbs. As in previous storms, tree damage from Irma is unlikely to be felt equally across communities. Since urban forests provide many important services, understanding what causes differences in impacts between communities is critical to recovery. Patterns of damage may depend on proximity to buildings and which species were present. Management practices, as well as average household income and age of housing, are also likely to be important. Therefore, the goal of this project is to understand how local ecological, social and economic conditions relate to the severity of damage to urban forests from Hurricane Irma. Irma provides a unique and urgent opportunity to learn how urban forests are affected by hurricanes, allowing communities to better predict where tree loss may be high. This will lead to better preparation and effective recovery plans for future storm events. Presentations and workshops will provide information to urban planners and tree care professionals, helping improve urban forest design, tree risk assessment and storm management efforts. <br/><br/>This project will provide an opportunity to directly evaluate urban tree canopy responses to hurricanes, and differences in tree damage related to biophysical and social characteristics. This project will build on existing measurements, utilizing field inventory data obtained in the months prior to the storm in Tampa, Gainesville, and Orange County, Florida. Field plots will be re-visited to obtain post-storm data assessing tree failure. These data will be used in conjunction with remotely sensed data obtained before and after the storm, as well as census data to establish socioeconomic context. This combination of field measurements, census data, and remotely sensed data products will allow inference about relationships between socioeconomic and forest structural factors and tree failure. The findings and predictions will directly address larger-scale questions about how urban forest ecosystems are altered in the face of future disturbance scenarios. This project will also improve estimates of the overall consequences of hurricanes to urban forests, allowing policy makers to make better decisions to manage the ecosystem services of this important resource.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project targets science teachers (chemistry, physics, biology, and earth science) who teach in a high school that includes refugees from Myanmar, Central America, and Africa. Roughly 20% of the students are classified as ELs, representing almost 20 different linguistic groups, including a variety of Asian, Spanish, and Arabic languages. The fundamental issue that the project seeks to address is the design of science learning environments to facilitate ELs' learning in linguistically diverse high school classrooms. Research on science education for ELs has recommended several effective teaching approaches, such as building on students' diverse and rich resources, engaging students in authentic science learning practices, and encouraging and valuing flexible use of multiple languages. However, previously most research has focused on teaching speakers of Spanish in elementary and middle school level science classrooms in which a majority of ELs speak the same language. Furthermore, while many PD programs supporting science education for ELs provide a short-term workshop and/or newly designed curriculum and curriculum guide, there is a lack of PD models that engage teachers in a sustained community of practice through collaboration between researchers and teachers. <br/><br/>The project's primary goal includes broadening participation with direct impact on 14 science teachers, who will impact over 2000 students, including over 450 ELs, during the project implementation period. The project provides a sustained model of the PD program which further impacts EL students of teachers who participated in the various phases of the project. The project has a potential to make an impact on ELs and high school science teachers of ELs in three different ways. First, by generating PD materials that include effective teaching materials and instructional practices for ELs, which can be used by other educators situated in similar educational contexts. Second, by giving presentations and publish papers that communicate findings of the project to academic communities. These outputs can impact other researchers who would like to design PD programs to foster ELs' science learning. Third, by implementing the developed and tested PD program in a larger scale. The implementation of the project will build capacity to conduct a larger PD project to impact more teachers and students. These anticipated outputs and outcomes will provide valuable resources for researcher and practitioners looking to support ELs' science learning and steps forward to equity. Finally, the project team and two cohorts of science teachers will co-design a school-wide science teacher PD to transform science teaching materials and practices of non-participating teachers.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

Despite existing knowledge of energy transport in some large protein systems, a systematic understanding of nanoscale thermal transport across H-bonded materials and, in particular, the role of H-bonds is lacking. The knowledge gap has hindered the understanding of heat transfer in living systems and development of novel biomaterials, e.g. synthetic spider silk, with extraordinary thermal properties. To address these critical challenges, this project investigates a suite of H-bonded materials including protein secondary structures and organic-inorganic interfaces, using state-of-the-art computational approaches combined with experimental validations. The research outcomes will accelerate design, development and deployment of novel H-bonded materials with tunable thermal properties, to meet the increasing needs for biocompatible, multifunctional materials in a wide range of areas including bio-implantation, tissue regeneration, cancer treatment, and energy storage. This project also seeks to achieve three societally relevant outcomes including (1) broadening participation of Female Native American students in engineering through two mentoring programs; (2) fostering skills of materials modeling among undergraduate students using a 3D Printing Challenge and a Fellowship program; and (3) conveying essential concepts of biomaterials and thermal management to high school students and the general public through outreach activities.<br/><br/>Building upon recent progress in advanced phonon transport theory and vibrational mode analysis, this project systematically reveals the role of H-bonds in thermal transport across several representative building blocks of H-bonded materials including nanocrystals (e.g. protein beta-sheets), nanowires (e.g. protein alpha-helices and 3-10 helices) and interfaces. By using molecular dynamics simulations and functional theory calculations, the investigations quantifies anisotropy of thermal conduction in the H-bonded building blocks in association with several structural and environmental factors including the H-bond connectivity (e.g. alpha helices vs. 3-10 helices), the side chain chemistry and size, and the solvation. Particular emphasis is given to understanding how different amino acid sequences can affect thermal conductivities and transport characteristics including phonon density of states, group velocities, and lifetimes. New physical insights are generated regarding: (1) how H-bond networks of different forms contribute to nanoscale thermal transport; and (2) how thermal transport in H-bonded materials differs from that in other 1D (e.g. nanotubes), 2D (e.g. graphene) and 3D materials that have no H-bonds. The achieved knowledge base enables development of new synthetic silk with highly conductive building blocks as well as novel H-bonded interfaces that are made, characterized and compared with existing materials for validation of the theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The NSF Division of Materials Research funds this award, which supports research and education on thermal and thermoelectric transport in correlated electron systems. <br/><br/>In correlated electron systems, thermal and thermoelectric transport coefficients offer complementary information as they probe different aspects of the electron dynamics. To take full advantage of these experimental techniques, it is crucial to further improve our theoretical understanding of transport processes involving both electric charge and heat. Theoretical understanding of transport in complex materials is often impeded by multiple factors including strong correlations, impurities, Fermi-surface geometry, and phonons. It is therefore important to study systems where only some of these complications occur and can be studied in isolation to gain insights that may then be applied to more complex systems. Following this strategy, the research will initially focus on the disordered electron liquid near the metal-insulator transition, and then branch out to include more exotic strongly correlated systems.<br/><br/>The main goals of the research project are: (i) To study theoretically the temperature dependence of the thermopower on the metallic side of the metal-insulator transition in disordered electron liquids. In particular, we will explore possible violations of the Mott-relation and the role of particle-hole asymmetry. (ii) To explore the effects of strong interactions on electric and thermal transport. In two-dimensional electron liquids, we intend to explore electric transport at the crossover between the low-temperature regime dominated by impurity scattering and higher temperatures where electron-electron collisions prevail. For strongly correlated materials, the project will focus on the response to a nonuniform temperature, where similar mechanisms can be at work.<br/><br/>Deepening our knowledge on fundamental mechanisms of thermoelectric and thermal transport, especially in semiconductors, may improve energy efficiency in electronic devices. In particular, thermoelectric coolers and generators could benefit from understanding how material properties like disorder, interactions or the distance from a critical point affect transport coefficients. Further impact of this activity will lie in training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Specifically, junior participants can greatly benefit from this international collaboration, which will allow them extended visits at a prestigious, non-US institute where they can be exposed to different ideas and approaches, and make connections that will help them in their future careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how rivers respond: whether they find a way through or around the developing mountains or basins, and how quickly they re-establish their prior courses, is critical to accurately interpreting the sedimentary record in their deltas.  In addition to providing greater insight into continental-scale rivers, this project will provide STEM training for graduate and undergraduate students and support research infrastructure and analytical facilities at a large state university and a small private university.  Further, the project will provide an opportunity for hands-on STEM training for ~30 middle school students per year under the guidance of a university professor.   <br/><br/>Research will focus on the ""Ancestral Rocky Mountains"" (ARM) and associated basins, which developed primarily in Utah, Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico 320-280 million years ago.  These basins archive changes associated with disruption and reintegration of a continental-scale river in response to ARM evolution.  This project will combine traditional and cutting-edge methods including field observations of sedimentary strata, U-Pb radiometric dating, analysis of Hf isotopes, and (U-Th)/He radiometric dating of zircons and monazite minerals in sandstones and igneous rocks to determine where sediment came from and how it changed through time.  In addition, (U-Th)/He radiometric dating on zircon minerals in igneous rocks will be used to determine when the mountain ranges developed.  These data will link changes in sediment sources to mountain and basin development through time. This will be augmented by development of new software to help determine the sources, and proportion of each source, for sediment based on radiometric dating of minerals in sandstones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will lead to a great increase in the number of located and characterized seismic events of various kinds and will potentially identify patterns in earthquake occurrence that could inform hazard and near-term rupture forecasting. The initial ""Mining Seismic Wavefields"" NSF Geoinformatics grant has led to significant progress dealing with data volumes that would have been impossible to process when the project began. This award will fund an additional year of that effort and will maintain this momentum in technique development to complete the analysis of proof-of-concept projects on vast waveform data sets, and to deploy the cyberinfrastructure for wider use by the seismological community.<br/><br/>The premise of the research is that continuous and/or densely recorded data coupled with high performance computing and scalable algorithms can enable a network-based approach to earthquake detection that greatly improves the detection of weak and unusual events that would be difficult or impossible to detect using traditional approaches. Numerous seismological observations confirm that proximal earthquake sources generate similar signals. Exploiting the discriminative power of this similarity has led to many fundamental discoveries; however, most similarity-based detection methods require prior knowledge of the source waveform, or template. Blind/uninformed search for signals having unknown signatures based on pair-wise or multiple matches has seen some success, but nave implementations of this approach suffer from quadratic scaling of computation with time such that problems of interest are inaccessible  even for the most capable computers. Similarly, for dense networks, the availability of continuous waveform data motivates alternative detection schemes based on waveform similarity at adjacent stations. This project will further develop efficient data-mining techniques to enable scalable similarity search of seismic wavefields. Technical challenges to be addressed as part of the research for spatially sparse recording are to develop improved similarity-preserving compression for repeating signals detected over a network, and to improve post-processing of search output that will both isolate signals of seismological interest and minimize false detections. For spatially dense recording, this would extend recently developed wavefield matching techniques to similarity across adjacent stations, which would enable similarity search across unaliased elastic wavefields in four dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the solid Earth likely contains substantially more carbon than is present at the surface, and transfers into and out of the deep reservoirs control the size and extent of surface carbon sinks. Although deep carbon exerts a fundamental control on the operation of Earth's well-studied surface carbon cycle, we have a limited understanding of carbon's sources, sinks, transfers and quantities below the surface.  Scientists from a wide range of disciplines, including geosciences, biology, materials science, physics, and chemistry, will convene at this conference to address how carbon operates in a planetary context.  This cross-disciplinary forum for discussions will foster the emerging field of deep carbon science by strengthening the community of deep carbon scientists, while providing a vital recurring outlet for exciting new deep carbon science.

To accomplish this task, convergent bottom-up and top-down approaches will be pursued. In the bottom-up approach the intermolecular structure of simple solvent systems will be measured using neutron diffraction and molecular refinement. The experimentally consistent intermolecular structures obtained will be used to inform molecular simulations.

Different species of living systems exhibit rich dynamical behaviors such as coexistence, competition, and symbiosis. The quantitative understanding of these phenomena is facilitated by the theoretical framework established in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and modeling aided by computer simulations. In this project, the aims to integrate fundamental concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, population dynamics and cell biology with Monte Carlo simulations to explore a focused class of complex systems: the parasite-host (PH) model and its biological implications.<br/><br/>The PH dynamics is less systematically explored, fundamentally different, and immensely important in life sciences. This project focuses on the parasite-host type interaction in the context of plasmids - small DNA molecules - transforming bacteria from susceptible to resistant to antibiotic treatments. The emergence of a resistant population comes from two mechanisms: plasmid-transformation and cell-cell conjugation. Both the dynamics, such as birth and death, and the spatial structure of the bacterial populations will be investigated. Casting this problem in the language of reaction-diffusion systems and using the theoretical results as a foundation, the research team plans to develop tools for probing the steady state properties and the dynamics of the PH system both in a well-mixed scenario and one with spatial structure. In this way, the PI aims to identify defining characteristics to curb the growth of a resistant population. Furthermore, the team plans to provide a more general description of the class of PH-like models and potential applications in the control of epidemics and the evolution of drug resistance in bacteria.<br/><br/>The research team will involve six undergraduate students over three years. They will hone their computational skills through solving a real-world problem. They will also advance their understanding of complex system and topics on stochastic processes through this project.

However, effectively delivering proteins and nucleic acids into cells could enable the treatment of a number of previously incurable diseases. Here, the PI proposes to create natural small lipid vesicles that contain pores. These will allow large molecules to be transported directly into cells. To load these small lipid vesicles with therapeutic molecules, biomaterials composed of nucleic acids will be engineered. To ensure that the lipid vesicles will only target specific cells, the vesicles will be decorated with molecules that can detect diseased cells. This research is expected to have broad impact across several scientific disciplines including biomaterials, nucleic acid and drug delivery, nanotechnology, and cell-mimicking materials. The fundamental knowledge gained from the proposal will significantly change the way that membrane-impermeable compounds are delivered to cells, especially for large molecules. This has important implications for human health because these carriers should allow diseases that are currently undruggable to be treated more safely and efficiently. The project will also enhance the nation's education infrastructure by developing a new biomaterials curriculum for graduate students and by delivering interactive teaching modules to high schools. Further, this project seeks to establish a mentoring-intensive program that will foster biomaterials research for minority and female undergraduate students. It will also establish a network of support for biomaterials graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL <br/>In this CAREER proposal, the PI plans to develop a novel class of cell-mimicking carriers, termed poresomes. These poresomes will be used to deliver macromolecules to the cytoplasm while bypassing endosomes. Despite tremendous progress in nanoscience, the cytoplasmic delivery of membrane-impermeable compounds such as negatively charged RNA remains challenging. This is because a significant fraction of the RNA that is delivered remains trapped in the endosomes, where it ultimately degrades. The objective of this CAREER proposal is to overcome these challenges by engineering cell-mimicking RNA-loaded lipid vesicles that are equipped with pores composed of connexin membrane channels. It is hypothesized that microRNA(miRNA)-loaded poresomes will connect to the connexin membrane channels of recipient cells to form gap junctions. In this way, miRNAs will be directly delivered into the cytoplasm whilst bypassing the degradative endosomal and lysosomal environments (Objective 1). Further, to effectively load poresomes with therapeutic cargo, the PI proposes to synthesize EXOmers, RNA-based sequences that are capable of exploiting the cellular trafficking machinery used to actively sort macromolecules into poresomes. Structure activity analyses will be performed to develop highly efficient sequences (Objective 2). Third, multifunctional poresomes that target non-internalizing receptors will be engineered to mediate cellular anchoring and facilitate miRNA transport through gap junctions (Objective 3). The educational goals are to (i) increase participation of underrepresented students through more understandable, relatable, and accessible science and (ii) improve biomaterials and nanoscience education for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. We will harness the learning advantages provided by visualization and animation to teach complex scientific subject matter. The integrative nature of our education outreach program should improve the communication skills of both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most plants have beneficial fungi associated with their roots, which are vital for nutrient uptake. However, the roots of plants are also often attacked by harmful fungi. This project aims to uncover how the interactions between beneficial and harmful root-associated fungi influence the success of non-native plants relative to native plants. This project will provide research training for undergraduate students including both laboratory and greenhouse methods. Additionally, the researchers will engage in outreach to K-12 students, as well as the public, to inform them about invasive species and plant-fungal interactions.<br/><br/>This project will examine the linkages between soil fungal communities and plant resource strategy within the context of the Resource Enemy Release Hypothesis, which predicts that nonnative species that have escaped their natural enemies in a new range will have relatively higher productivity as compared to native species, and that this advantage increases with resource availability. This research will test whether plant-fungal relationships differ systematically between fast and slow-growing species, using a well-studied Eastern North American invasive shrub system. Additionally, the research team will test whether differences in plant-fungal relations depend on a plant's co-evolutionary history with soil fungi, or alternatively, whether differences in plant-fungal relations apparent in invasive species are due to their overall bias toward fast growth. Multiple native and invasive plants, representing congeneric pairs with a range of plant growth characteristics, will be included in the study to control for phylogeny. In the greenhouse, plants will be subjected to two complementary inoculation experiments to test the relationship between each plant and its soil microbial community, and to test the mycorrhizal responsiveness of each species.

Understanding the nature of gravity at microscopic distances is one of the most important open problems in fundamental physics. Although General Relativity provides an extremely well-tested framework for describing gravitational effects at large distances, it cannot be consistently combined with the Standard Model of particle physics to provide a description of gravity at small scales. The development of a quantum theory of gravity that can be incorporated into the Standard Model is a central goal of fundamental physics, with broad implications for our understanding of particle physics and the mysterious nature of the ""dark energy"" that appears to permeate the universe. Many theories attempting to provide a consistent microscopic framework for gravity (e.g., those involving extra dimensions) predict that gravity could deviate from the familiar inverse square law at distances shorter than a mm. Such deviations are extremely difficult to measure experimentally due to the small strength of gravitational interactions at microscopic distances. The studies described here attempt to gain insights into the realm of microscopic gravitational forces with a novel experimental setup. Additionally, the research will enhance the training of students in STEM areas which are vital for the future of the nation.<br/><br/><br/>Previous measurements at these distance scales have employed techniques derived from human-size devices in which mechanical springs are used as force sensors.

Previous studies undertaken by this group include the most sensitive search to date for fractional charges over 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the charge of an electron. This is a by-product of having to discharge the microspheres and check that they are really neutral. The group has completed the construction of a new trap in which the entire microsphere position readout is carried out interferometrically.  This is a first in this area of research and will be applicable to other areas, e.g. biology or polymer science. The studies supported by this grant include exploring the possibility of spinning the microspheres, something that could reduce the background of the gravity measurements and may also lead to the development of nanogyroscopes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The next series of conferences will have seven primary host universities: Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at Austin, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas Christian University and The University of Texas at Arlington.<br/><br/>By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. In so doing, the conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research as well as offering a venue for regional scholars and early career researchers. This stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a project to foster research opportunities for select junior faculty at these institutions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The permanent web page for the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~tgtc/archive/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Properties of synthetic polymers can be tuned by engineering their molecular structure. This allows polymers to be used in a variety of applications ranging from packaging to automobiles, and from fabrics to surgical sutures. Polymers are typically processed in the liquid or melt state, where the molecular structure strongly influences flow properties. This relationship between molecular structure and flow properties is often studied using a theory called the tube model. <br/><br/>Failures of the standard tube model can be traced to the manner in which it simplifies ""multibody interactions"" between polymer molecules. These interactions are more accurately described by a simulation model called the slip link model, which is unfortunately computationally costly. This project seeks to combine the strength of tube model (speed) with that of the slip link model (accuracy) through the development of augmented tube models. If successful, this research will provide a template for blending theories and simulations, which is expected have far reaching consequences for materials characterization, even outside the polymer industry.<br/><br/>The award also supports the education of minority students at Florida State University by providing modern training in materials modeling, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and statistical analysis.

The tube model is a popular mean-field theory for entangled polymer melts. Unfortunately, it fails consistently even for relatively simple systems like binary blends of monodisperse polymers with widely separated relaxation times. On the other hand, different slip link models, all of which explicitly treat entanglements between chains as slip links, are remarkably successful for such systems. This is primarily due to the different treatment of a relaxation mechanism called constraint release, in the two models. In slip link models, the description of constraint release is ""natural"", while it can be complicated, and still inaccurate, in the tube model. A drawback of slip link models is their computational cost. This project seeks to combine the strength of tube models (speed) with that of the slip link models (natural and accurate representation of constraint release). The overarching research objectives are (i) to explore the development of augmented tube models, which combine these strengths, and (ii) to test these augmented models on the computationally intensive inverse problem of inferring the composition of a polymer mixture from experimental measurements of rheology. <br/><br/>The award supports the development of a fast slip link model called ecoSLM, and its validation, using binary blends of star and linear polymers. Research activities to service the overall objectives are broken down into four specific tasks: (i) validating the ecoSLM against all available experimental data on linear-linear, star-linear, and star-star blends, (ii) using the validated ecoSLM to map out the design space to help identify regions where the tube model fails, (iii) developing augmented tube model, which uses ecoSLM to guide the tube model to the correct physics/parameters, and (iv) to use these augmented tube models for inverse modeling.<br/><br/>The project explores the augmentation of a mean-field theory with a stochastic simulation model, ecoSLM, in order to combine speed with accuracy. If successful, it can provide a template for other problems in materials science that seek to combine a mean-field theory with simple simulation models. Using a Bayesian framework for inverse modeling, this can have far reaching implications for materials characterization, even outside the polymer industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Damage to urban forests was widespread. Many trees were uprooted or lost leaves and limbs. As in previous storms, tree damage from Irma is unlikely to be felt equally across communities. Since urban forests provide many important services, understanding what causes differences in impacts between communities is critical to recovery. Patterns of damage may depend on proximity to buildings and which species were present. Management practices, as well as average household income and age of housing, are also likely to be important. Therefore, the goal of this project is to understand how local ecological, social and economic conditions relate to the severity of damage to urban forests from Hurricane Irma. Irma provides a unique and urgent opportunity to learn how urban forests are affected by hurricanes, allowing communities to better predict where tree loss may be high. This will lead to better preparation and effective recovery plans for future storm events. Presentations and workshops will provide information to urban planners and tree care professionals, helping improve urban forest design, tree risk assessment and storm management efforts. <br/><br/>This project will provide an opportunity to directly evaluate urban tree canopy responses to hurricanes, and differences in tree damage related to biophysical and social characteristics. This project will build on existing measurements, utilizing field inventory data obtained in the months prior to the storm in Tampa, Gainesville, and Orange County, Florida. Field plots will be re-visited to obtain post-storm data assessing tree failure. These data will be used in conjunction with remotely sensed data obtained before and after the storm, as well as census data to establish socioeconomic context. This combination of field measurements, census data, and remotely sensed data products will allow inference about relationships between socioeconomic and forest structural factors and tree failure. The findings and predictions will directly address larger-scale questions about how urban forest ecosystems are altered in the face of future disturbance scenarios. This project will also improve estimates of the overall consequences of hurricanes to urban forests, allowing policy makers to make better decisions to manage the ecosystem services of this important resource.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Internal tides can constitute a dominant energy source on continental shelves, where they can lead to processes such as soliton generation, turbulent mixing and cross shelf exchange, with wide ranging implications for transport, biological productivity and near-shore pollution. This study will explore how internal tides are transformed near the shelf break to propagate along the coast and how quickly they decay by radiating some of their energy offshore.<br/><br/><br/>In the deep ocean internal tides usually manifest as low vertical mode waves, however, close to the continental shelf break they may take the form of ""leaky"" (superinertial) baroclinic coastal trapped waves and edge waves. These modal structures are superinertial analogues to the well studied subinertial coastal trapped waves, having a component that radiates along the shelf break. However, they are distinguished from subinertial waves by exhibiting coincident radiation offshore (i.e. ""leaking""). The goal of this study is to better understand the nature of internal tides close to the coastal margin, where the presence of leaky baroclinic trapped internal tides may contribute to the along shore variability and propagation of tidal energy. The study will consider the forcing of these waves by both the local astronomical tide, and by remotely incident deep ocean internal tides. The approach will include idealized, linear, two-dimensional (cross-shore) analyses; idealized, three-dimensional, nonlinear numerical simulations of the coastal response to local and remote forcing; and a suite of realistic numerical simulations to investigate leaky trapped internal tide energy along the U.

But learning a second language as an adult is hard, especially when it is very different from one's first language. This study will examine whether greater similarity between the first and second language 1) facilitates learning in the second language and 2) effects the brain processes that underlie learning. English speakers and Hebrew speakers are compared on their ability to learn words in a ""new"" language, created by the investigators, that shares features with both English and Hebrew. The investigators use functional brain imaging to examine whether learning familiar language features uses different brain systems than when learning unfamiliar language features. The study will also examine the effect of variability in the training items on learning. High variability involves training many different words with similar features whereas low variability training involves repeating fewer words more times. More broadly, the results will uncover aspects of the brain basis for second-language learning and will inform methods for improving second-language instruction. The project will integrate research and education by providing training to students at all levels from undergraduate to postdoctoral and includes a visiting scholar program between the US and Israel. The investigators will also hold workshops on second language learning for local professionals in both countries.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to our understanding of the role of domain-general principles of learning and consolidation in second-language acquisition. It will examine the relative involvement of mediotemporal and neocortical learning mechanisms in the acquisition of a second language, depending on the presence of pre-existing experience with similar abstract linguistic structures in the first language. The structure of words varies across languages. In Hebrew, many words have a three-consonant root, such as the word perax (meaning ""flower""), which contains the root p-r-x (meaning, ""to bloom""). In contrast, most complex English words contain a base and an affix. For example, piglet contains the base ""pig"" and the affix ""let."" This study will shed light on the role of compositional processes in second-language learners and suggest a mechanism by which transfer from the first language may affect such compositional processes. Differences in the linguistic properties, such as morphological structure of the two languages, may influence the neurocognitive basis of learning. Finally, parameters that can improve learning and enhance extraction of morphological regularities from new words will be examined. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a partnership between the National Science Foundation and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upon colonization of new environments, however, physiological systems that evolved in one environmental context may produce misdirected responses when they are inappropriately coopted to respond to novel challenges. Prominent examples of this phenomenon include several physiological responses to high-elevation environments in native lowlanders. For example, exposure to high elevation induces excessive red blood cell production, constriction of pulmonary blood vessels, and other physiological changes in lowlanders that may be considered maladaptive because they contribute to high-altitude diseases (e.g. chronic mountain sickness, pulmonary edema). In such cases, natural selection should favor attenuation of these maladaptive responses. This research focuses on understanding the evolutionary, physiological, and genetic mechanisms that allow such maladaptive ancestral responses to blunted, without simultaneously impacting beneficial responses. The project PIs will use a series of acclimation experiments and field studies of high- and low-altitude populations of deer mice to explore the adaptive modification of physiological responses to high-altitude stressors. Like indigenous high-elevation human populations, highland deer mice exhibit blunted maladaptive responses to hypoxia. The results of this research will also be used to develop a public outreach program that illustrates the value of comparative physiology for informing applied problems in human health using high-altitude environments and the animals that inhabit them as its centerpiece. These outreach efforts will be centered on the development of short films that will serve as springboards for interactive discussions between researchers and the general public.<br/><br/>Many physiological responses to hypoxia are largely coordinated by a family of master transcription factors, known as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF1-3). Because mutations that alter the function of transcription factors like HIF (i.e. trans-regulatory mutations) are prone to pleiotropic effects, evolutionary theory suggests that they should be rare in the adaptive modification of regulatory networks compared to changes that are more modular in their phenotypic effects. Nonetheless, recent genomic studies of high-elevation human populations, and several other species have shown that allelic variation in a gene (EPAS1) that encodes a specific HIF isoform (HIF2) has been the target of natural selection, and is associated with the attenuation of maladaptive responses to hypoxia. Thus, adaptive modification of regulatory networks that coordinate hypoxia responses seems to have repeatedly proceeded through modification of trans-regulatory factors in high-elevation specialists. This poses interesting physiological and evolutionary questions because HIF2 also coordinates a number of beneficial physiological changes to maintain O2 homeostasis. Given that alteration of HIF2 induce deleterious pleiotropic effects, how can maladaptive responses be attenuated while adaptive responses are maintained? Does alteration of HIF function require compensatory cis-regulatory mutations in HIF targets that coordinate adaptive responses or can compensatory modifications be achieved through epigenetic changes? This research will address these questions using a series of physiological, genetic, and transcriptomic experiments on highland and lowland deer mice. Like other highland specialists, patterns of allele frequency variation at EPAS1 suggest local adaptation in deer mice, and this variation is associated with the attenuation of maladaptive hypoxia responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An alternate approach is to specialize processor design for a small set of tasks, sacrificing generality for improved performance and energy-efficiency.  However, if hardware specialization is relied on too much, the pace of innovation for new and fast-moving applications will be stifled.  Hence, new techniques are required to balance the fundamental trade-offs between the efficiency of specialized processors with the usefulness of general processors. A promising way forward is the development of specialization fabrics, where the software interface and hardware implementation are co-designed to enable efficient execution of programs with broad application characteristics.  This CAREER award develops the principles behind building such fabrics, addressing their two main challenges.  The first is scalability: how to support vast amounts of computational units without mitigating the benefits of specialization.  The second is modularity: how to enable simple tailoring of the fabric to a particular design setting (e.g. for a datacenter machine, phone, or wearable) through composable hardware. The broad potential of this work is to enable principled specialized hardware which can continue to bring exponential performance and energy improvements, both through dissemination of discovered principles and through open source releases of hardware and software.  For industry, the developed frameworks can enable hardware companies to leverage zero-design-effort hardware tailored for their use cases.  For academia, these can lower the cost of entry of hardware/software co-design research, and enable researchers to make cross-domain innovations more easily.  This framework is being integrated into courses to teach the fundamental interactions between hardware and software.<br/><br/>Overall, the broad goal of this work is to create a programmable accelerator fabric, scalable to high throughput, and whose features can be modularly composed - ultimately enabling accelerator-like performance and energy efficiency across many domains. Intellectually, it furthers the unification of two disparate fields of computer architecture, the study of on-chip memory systems and the study of architectural specialization. The project develops the principles of scalable and modular specialization fabrics through two thrusts.  The first explores how to leverage high-level ISA constructs to rethink the design of the cache hierarchy and on-chip communication network for specialization fabrics, which are typically constrained by communication bandwidth or access/storage energy.  The key innovation is to expose to the memory system a set of higher level abstractions describing coarse-grain patterns of memory access.  Leveraging this information can reduce the inefficiencies of communication and tag/redundant cache access, but requires a significant overhaul to existing protocols to maintain simple memory semantics. The second thrust develops a framework for composing modular architecture features to enable trivial hardware customization for vastly different application domains. The key innovation is the development of high-level ISA features which have a direct correspondence to composable hardware structures. This thrust develops a template design and instruction-set description for composing ISA-exposed microarchitecture features, explores a set of ISA features for regular and irregular workloads, and develops a compiler to hide ISA complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Areas of mathematics with physical applications tend to appear in the low levels of the corresponding complexity hierarchy. Passing to higher levels of complexity enables mathematicians to make connections between different areas of mathematics, and to develop productive general theories. There is a corresponding division of the universe of mathematics into an absolute part, where natural questions tend to be resolved by the standard axioms, and a more abstract part where extensions of the standard axiom system are needed to resolve many fundamental questions. The main focus of Larson's research is the relationship between these parts. The technical machinery involved in this project includes Cohen's forcing technique, axioms asserting the existence of winning strategies in infinite games, and axioms asserting the existence of infinite objects whose existence cannot be proved from the standard axioms for mathematics. These techniques originate in set theory, which serves as the most commonly accepted foundations for mathematics. Larson's work applies them to other areas, including model theory, topology and analysis. Larson hopes to make progress with this approach on several longstanding well-known open problems.<br/><br/>One aspect of Larson's work concerns forcing over models of determinacy to produce canonical models. Woodin's Pmax forcing, when applied to a model of determinacy, produces a model which is maximal for subsets of the set of countable ordinals. One project, initiated by Woodin, and continued by Larson in collaboration with other researchers, is the extent to which this maximality can be made to hold for larger cardinals. Another product, largely in collaboration with Jindrich Zapletal, converts a number of classical ZFC constructions into partial orders, which when applied to determinacy models produce models of fragments of the Axiom of Choice. This approach has resolved a number of classical questions about the relationship between forms of the Axiom of Choice, but may also be able to shine light on newer problems in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Other aspects of the project include a new approach to Vaught's Conjecture, one of the oldest problems in model theory, and the study of the notion of universally measurability, a fundamental concept from analysis which is still not well understood. Finally, Larson is working on a book on unpublished work of W.H. Woodin, on extensions of the Axiom of Determinacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upon colonization of new environments, however, physiological systems that evolved in one environmental context may produce misdirected responses when they are inappropriately coopted to respond to novel challenges. Prominent examples of this phenomenon include several physiological responses to high-elevation environments in native lowlanders. For example, exposure to high elevation induces excessive red blood cell production, constriction of pulmonary blood vessels, and other physiological changes in lowlanders that may be considered maladaptive because they contribute to high-altitude diseases (e.g. chronic mountain sickness, pulmonary edema). In such cases, natural selection should favor attenuation of these maladaptive responses. This research focuses on understanding the evolutionary, physiological, and genetic mechanisms that allow such maladaptive ancestral responses to blunted, without simultaneously impacting beneficial responses. The project PIs will use a series of acclimation experiments and field studies of high- and low-altitude populations of deer mice to explore the adaptive modification of physiological responses to high-altitude stressors. Like indigenous high-elevation human populations, highland deer mice exhibit blunted maladaptive responses to hypoxia. The results of this research will also be used to develop a public outreach program that illustrates the value of comparative physiology for informing applied problems in human health using high-altitude environments and the animals that inhabit them as its centerpiece. These outreach efforts will be centered on the development of short films that will serve as springboards for interactive discussions between researchers and the general public.<br/><br/>Many physiological responses to hypoxia are largely coordinated by a family of master transcription factors, known as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF1-3). Because mutations that alter the function of transcription factors like HIF (i.e. trans-regulatory mutations) are prone to pleiotropic effects, evolutionary theory suggests that they should be rare in the adaptive modification of regulatory networks compared to changes that are more modular in their phenotypic effects. Nonetheless, recent genomic studies of high-elevation human populations, and several other species have shown that allelic variation in a gene (EPAS1) that encodes a specific HIF isoform (HIF2) has been the target of natural selection, and is associated with the attenuation of maladaptive responses to hypoxia. Thus, adaptive modification of regulatory networks that coordinate hypoxia responses seems to have repeatedly proceeded through modification of trans-regulatory factors in high-elevation specialists. This poses interesting physiological and evolutionary questions because HIF2 also coordinates a number of beneficial physiological changes to maintain O2 homeostasis. Given that alteration of HIF2 induce deleterious pleiotropic effects, how can maladaptive responses be attenuated while adaptive responses are maintained? Does alteration of HIF function require compensatory cis-regulatory mutations in HIF targets that coordinate adaptive responses or can compensatory modifications be achieved through epigenetic changes? This research will address these questions using a series of physiological, genetic, and transcriptomic experiments on highland and lowland deer mice. Like other highland specialists, patterns of allele frequency variation at EPAS1 suggest local adaptation in deer mice, and this variation is associated with the attenuation of maladaptive hypoxia responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also the largest ice-free region of Antarctica, and thus its deposits and landforms contain unique records of past climate not accessible elsewhere in the Antarctic continent or the world. In order to accurately interpret any geologic feature, however, we must understand how it forms and changes through time. In particular, in the Dry Valleys, we have a poor understanding of the rates and causes of one of Earth's most fundamental geologic phenomenon - physical rock breakdown. For example, the Dry Valleys lack moisture, which is thought to play a key role in rock breakdown in most other locations on the planet. What serves to fracture rocks in this seemingly inert environment? This project aims to answer that question by 'listening' as rocks crack in the Dry Valleys. We will instrument boulders with sensors that act as miniature seismographs, recording even the smallest microcracking on and within the rocks. At the same time, we will monitor the weather and environment around the rocks to record the conditions that trigger cracking events. While we collect these data, we will gather rock samples from deposits of different ages (from thousands to millions of years old) in the Dry Valleys. Measurements on these samples will allow us to see how quickly rocks breakdown and how their characteristics change over geologic time. The combined datasets will allow future scientists to more accurately understand the paleoclimates and landscapes of Antarctica, and possibly even Mars.  This project will also serve to support two female investigators in a field where women are still largely underrepresented. The project will also provide unique exposure and experience to students, ranging from elementary students to the undergraduate and graduate students who will be working directly on various aspects of the project. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Rocks in the McMurdo Dry Valleys experience some of the lowest erosion rates on Earth. However, our current understanding of the relative role that different weathering factors (moisture, freezing temperatures, thermal cycling, salt crystallization or hydration, and wind abrasion) play in these and other environments is limited. Further, in the Dry Valleys, there has been no systematic evaluation of the variance in weathering and associated rock erosion rates, which may change significantly as a function of subaerial exposure duration, lithology, and texture. This research seeks to (1) characterize the primary drivers of rock breakdown, (2) better quantify erosion rates, and (3) determine the lithological and environmental factors that influence weathering and erosion in the Dry Valleys. Rock breakdown (cracking) will be recorded in real-time on in situ boulders using a custom acoustic emission monitoring system. By coupling acoustic emission data with micrometeorological measurements at and near rock surfaces, this study will directly test hypotheses relating to the environmental drivers of rock breakdown under this unique polar desert climate over short (minute to monthly) timescales. Cosmogenic nuclide techniques including a novel combination of 6 isotopes (Be-10, Al-26, He-3, Ne-21, Cl-36, C-14) together with rock property measurements (e.g., strength, elastic moduli, thermal properties) will be used to elucidate the complex relationship between long-term (kyr to Myr) boulder erosion rates, lithology, rock properties, and subaerial exposure duration. By synthesizing these measurements with short-term cracking data from the acoustic emission system, the proposed work will thoroughly examine which lithological and environmental factors and grain-scale processes are driving geomorphic evolution in the Dry Valleys. By constraining boulder erosion rates and determining their sensitivity to rock properties and age, the results will be directly applicable to cosmogenic nuclide exposure age studies in this region. Additionally, the resulting information on weathering processes and their relationship to rock morphology in the Dry Valleys can be used to address hypotheses as to formation of similar rock morphologies on Mars. The Project Investigators will participate in an elementary school outreach program run by Gonzaga University, and the project will support an undergraduate and graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed work examines correlations between mid ocean ridge basalt (MORB) chemistry and images of Earth's interior produced using seismic tomography. It uses large-scale numerical models of mantle flow to connect surface observations with past and present mantle structure. The proposed work has three components. First, it examines the distributions of helium isotopes and other geochemical indicators of mantle temperature at spreading centers and how these are related to temperature and compositional variations in the sub-oceanic mantle. Second, it explores the flow history of mantle material that is sampled at spreading centers. Third, it addresses how the mid ocean ridges in different ocean basins have sampled the mantle since the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea. The project will provide new information about how variations in seismic velocity beneath the ocean basins are related to the variations in chemical composition of MORB, and how upper mantle variations in composition and temperature are related to deeper mantle structure.<br/><br/>Different disciplines make distinct contributions to our understanding of the dynamics of Earth's mantle. In particular, relating the distribution of geochemical and seismological heterogeneity at the global scale has been a challenge because of the different wavelengths sampled in these two types of approaches: local, for geochemistry, long wavelength, for seismology. Recently, progress has been made in both fields, with resolution reaching sub-1000 km scale in global seismic tomography, and a more complete geochemical sampling along mid-ocean ridges, allowing the investigation of patterns at wavelengths commensurate with the seismic imaging. Concurrently, progress has been made in developing methodologies for realistic geodynamic modeling of mantle circulation in 3D, incorporating constraints from seismology and surface observables (e.g. plate motions, topography, and the geoid). Tying these elements together to better constrain the flow history of material sampled at ridges is becoming feasible at the present time. The proposed work will produce new geochemical datasets, tomographic models, and results from geodynamic models that will be distributed to the broader geoscience community for further analysis and in a format that permits immersive 3D visualization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CHI 2018 will be held April 21-26 in Montreal, Canada, and is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI).  The annual CHI conferences are the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practice relating to human-computer interaction, and they are attended by approximately 3,000 HCI professionals from around the world.  More information about this year's conference is available online at https://chi2018.acm.org/.  The topic of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is more important now than at any other time in the history of computing.  As computers become smaller, faster, and more ubiquitous, our ability to use them effectively becomes critical.  Not only must we design usable systems, but we must do so in a rapidly changing landscape of computing hardware that includes desktops, mobile phones, and embedded systems.  A unique aspect of HCI is that it requires the study of not just computing, but of the combination of computing and people.  Because people are involved, HCI is a field where aspects such as culture, socio-economic background, gender, etc., are considered in the systems that we build.  This is a clear argument for the development of a diverse field of researchers who bring to bear a wide range of experiences in their problem solving skills.  The PIs have made a serious effort to attract participants from HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) and HSI (Hispanic-Serving Institutions).

This award also supports the team's efforts to mentor underserved area students through the college applications and annual science fair processes, and to educate a diverse body of younger scientists about the physical sciences as part of local outreach efforts to underserved populations, including local high school Girls Who Code Clubs.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research focused on advancing understanding of two-dimensional materials. Two-dimensional (2D) inorganic materials within the quantum confinement limit are emerging as an important class of nanomaterials for novel applications in information technology, optoelectronics, spintronics, and energy storage and conversion technologies. Because of the effects of enhanced quantum confinement and high surface-to-volume ratios, low dimensional materials possess extraordinary chemical and physical properties, including band gaps and metal-semiconductor transitions whose properties can be tuned by altering their doping and layering. As a result, they can range from insulators to topological insulators to semiconductors, and even, superconductors. Understanding the properties of these materials thus presents a materials research opportunity that could have immediate importance to the future design of semiconductor devices. The team aims to develop high accuracy methods to overcome limitations of first principles density-functional-based approaches, particularly in their application to 2D materials, to enable better understanding of experiments. The method development involves combining Quantum Monte Carlo with cluster expansion methods that are commonly used to model alloys. The team will use these methods to study mono/few layer structures of post-transition metal chalcogenides spanning from metals to gap semiconductors. Direct gap compounds for photovoltaics and photoelectrochemical water splitting applications will be designed using alloying as a means to tune phase stability, and electronic and optical properties. <br/>						<br/>The PIs will use this research to educate a diverse body of younger scientists about the physical sciences as part of local outreach efforts to underserved populations, including local high school Girls Who Code Clubs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For those models to be usable by scientists and clinicians who are experts in the biomedical phenomenon being modeled, it is important that the model features and activity be presented visually to make them understandable. This project seeks to develop a novel, modular computational approach to this challenge.  It will use modeling of the immune response to an important respiratory fungal infection as a test bed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.  This project will advance knowledge in computational modeling of biomedical systems and in the pathophysiology of infection. This particular infection has become increasingly relevant as it occurs most frequently in immuno-compromised individuals, including cancer and transplant patients. The developed model will examine how an individual's immune system interacts with the fungal spores to better understand the progression of this infection.  The eventual goal would be to take advantage of this improved understanding to spur the development of new treatments for this fungal infection.<br/><br/>This complexity of multiscale models of biomedical processes poses multiple challenges related to mathematical modeling, software design, validation, reproducibility, and extensibility. The computational goal of this project is to develop a novel modular approach to model architecture, using a recently introduced technology of lightweight virtual machines and a user-friendly open-source platform for the construction and linking of these so-called ""Docker containers"" to create complex modular models in a transparent fashion. A key benefit of software containers is that they can encompass the entire computational environment of a model, enabling unprecedented reproducibility of computational results.  For this project, this computational modeling will be focused on the development of a multiscale model capturing the early stages of invasive aspergillosis. Invasive aspergillosis is one of the most common fungal infections in immunocompromised hosts and carries a poor prognosis. The spores of the causative organism, Aspergillus fumigatus, are ubiquitously distributed in the environment. Healthy hosts clear the inhaled spores without developing disease, but individuals with impaired immunity are susceptible to a life-threatening respiratory infection that can then disseminate to other organs. The increasing use of immunosuppressive therapies in transplantation and cancer has dramatically increased suffering and death from this infection, and this trend is expected to continue. The biomedical focus of the proposed project is the battle over iron between the fungus and the host. The overarching biomedical goal is to develop a simulation tool to explore the role of iron in invasive aspergillosis across biochemical and biophysical conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematics anxiety describes the feeling of fear and apprehension experienced prior to or during math related activities. It is a highly prevalent emotion in the student population. Highly math anxious students, compared to their low math anxiety counterparts, exhibit lower math achievement and less interest in math-related career paths. To understand more precisely why and how mathematics anxiety may hinder the development of mathematics ability, this project will (1) investigate the real-time impacts of mathematics anxiety on math problem solving; (2) examine the long-term impacts of mathematics anxiety on engagement in math learning in and out of school; and (3) explore possible individual characteristics that may mitigate the negative implications of mathematics anxiety on math learning outcomes. The project is supported by a CAREER award to Texas Tech University by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to further our scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying the negative association between mathematics anxiety and mathematics achievement. Ultimately, this knowledge will provide opportunities to improve the quality of emotional experiences and knowledge acquisition in math education. This project will integrate methodological approaches from cognitive-affective sciences, educational sciences, psychophysiology, and developmental psychology into a 3-year longitudinal design, following students from upper elementary school into middle school. First, this project will test the hypothesis that mathematics anxiety impairs math performance by undermining goal-driven attention needed for successful math problem solving. The researchers will examine continuous attention distribution patterns (measured by eye movement) during math problem solving in students with varying levels of mathematics anxiety. Second, the researchers will examine the longitudinal relation between mathematics anxiety and mathematics attainment, with the hypothesis that avoidance and disengagement in math learning mediate this developmental relation in multiple contexts, in class, at home, and in out of school math activities. Third, researchers will incorporate electrocardiography, impedance cardiography, and questionnaire measures to explore state and trait emotion regulation and effort mobilization as possible mechanisms in uncoupling undesired math learning outcomes from mathematics anxiety. Through finding dissemination as well as education and outreach programs, this project will offer the opportunity to promote public understanding of mathematics learning in particular, and to educate parents and teachers to become better consumers of the science of learning in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mangrove expansion in the Gulf coastal region is a recent phenomenon, and the new insights from this project will provide a more comprehensive understanding of past environmental patterns and future expansion areas based on climatic fluctuations.  The project will expand knowledge regarding how feedbacks from human-environment interactions affect wetland vegetation shifts in a region characterized by increasing environmental uncertainty.  Project benefits to the broader community will include a better understanding of mangrove expansion to coastal area residents and communities and proactive water resources management planning by appropriate coastal federal and state agencies.

The investigators will participate in workshops with Louisiana school teachers and engage them in communicating scientific knowledge about environmental changes and mangrove expansion.<br/><br/>Mangroves play a critical role in global carbon sequestration and provide many important ecosystem services.  Long-term quantitative data on the distribution and abundance of mangroves along the U.S. Gulf Coast have been largely inadequate.  This project will produce high-resolution multi-proxy stratigraphic records from four critical mangrove habitats to elucidate the changing distribution of all mangrove species along the Gulf Coast over the last 2,000 years. The investigators will focus on three core questions: (1) How has the distribution and abundance of mangroves changed in response to Holocene environmental and climatic variations along the U.S Gulf Coast?  (2) Which environmental variables are most likely to be responsible for controlling the spatial distribution of mangroves in the U.S?  (3) What will be the northern ranges of different mangrove species by the end of the 21st century?  The investigators will use a combination of palynological, X-ray fluorescence, and loss-on-ignition analytic techniques and radiocarbon dating to reconstruct the Holocene vegetation changes and sedimentary history of mangrove habitats along the U.S Gulf Coast.

Hence understanding the origin of continents and how portions of them remain stable for billions of years is central to understanding the evolution of the Earth. The old, stable cores of continents (cratons) are underlain by thick layers of mantle (the silicate layer of the Earth that lies below the crust), and these mantle roots are thought to contribute to continental stability. Yet, it remains debated how the continental mantle formed and evolved. In particular, the roles of magma or fluid interaction with the mantle, either during or after the continent formation, are unclear, although widespread layering observed in the cratonic mantle by seismic imaging may have been created by magma and fluid related processes. This research will constrain the formation and evolution of cratons by bracketing scenarios of melt/fluid and mantle reactions that are consistent with geophysical observations at mid-lithospheric depths. The research findings - disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and colloquia, and class room lectures and activities - will impact a wide range of Earth science sub-disciplines including petrology-geochemistry, mineral physics, geodynamics, and seismology. The proposal will support female PhD students in high P-T experimental petrology, mineral physics, and seismology, and support the research activities of several undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups. In addition to their own research, all the students will participate in discussions and write research articles together with all 3 PIs, learning how to combine concepts and methods from three different yet related sub-disciplines of solid Earth science. The proposal will thus directly further the educational experience and professional development of several students at various stages of their careers. The proposed research will also support an early career PI in the field of mineral physics and will aid the investigators in engaging K-12 students in science.<br/><br/>The stability of the continental interiors for 2-3 billion years is a key feature of the Earth's dynamical and thermal evolution. Understanding the geophysical structure, petrology, and material properties of cratonic mantles and the tectonic history that produced them is therefore one of the grand challenges of Earth science. A curious feature of subcontinental mantles is the presence of distinct reductions in seismic shear velocity at depths of 60-150 km, often called mid-lithospheric discontinuities (MLDs). Given the widespread occurrence of MLDs within cratons, their origins may be linked to craton formation; however, the causal link between MLD and craton formation is yet to be established, and MLD origins remain highly debated. One hypothesis is that MLDs represent zones enriched in CO2-H2O volatiles, which led to stability of hydrous and/or carbonate minerals or partial melts. This project will test this hypothesis by integrating results from experimental petrology, mineral physics, and seismology. Through laboratory experiments, this project will constrain the phase equilibria of cratonic mantle peridotites fluxed by mixed CO2-H2O volatiles at MLD depths, taking into consideration how the agent of volatile introduction may vary with craton formation models. The goal will be to determine the stability of hydrous and carbonate mineral phases over partial melts and obtain the compositions and proportions of mineral phases as a function of depth, temperature, and melt/fluid:peridotite ratio for each of the cases. Guided by the phase equilibria experiments and compiled xenolith data, thermoelastic properties of the appropriate end members and intermediate solid solutions of amphibole and mica will be determined using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) and first principles simulation. Using the mineral assemblages from experiments and updated elasticity data from new mineral physics, mantle velocity models will be predicted. These will be compared to mantle models for southern African craton (to be obtained by joint inversion of surface wave, Sp and Ps data) and North America, and used to calculate synthetic Sp and Ps receiver function stacks that will be compared to MLD observations globally. The proposed research will test whether one or several scenarios of fluid/melt infiltration into cratons, if any, satisfy the geophysical and petrologic characters of continental mantles at mid-lithospheric depths. Our research will also lead to specific products such as solidus parameterizations of depleted mantle+CO2+H2O; metasomatized mantle mineral assemblages as a function of P-T, infiltrated fluid/melt composition and fluid/melt:rock ratio; codes for computing seismic velocities for MLD-related assemblages with updated thermoelastic data; and observed mantle discontinuity parameters and mantle velocity models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first question considered is to what extent can the geometry of a body be determined from information about a force field associated to the body (for instance its gravitational field)?  Such inverse problems in potential theory have a rich history, but the mathematical tools needed to answer this question are currently underdeveloped.  The investigation will focus especially on what can be said if one only knows that the field has bounded magnitude, which is of particular interest in applications.  A second question to be explored is how, and to what degree of accuracy, can one determine the asymptotic (or long term) behavior of a random function that evolves with time, based on certain empirical measurements?<br/> <br/>More specifically, the principal investigator proposes to research several questions concerning the relationship between the geometrical properties of a measure and the regularity properties of an associated operator. The primary question of interest is the following: What can be deduced about a measure from the knowledge that singular integral operator associated to it has good regularity properties?  Under these circumstances, can the measure have a fractal structure, or must its support be contained in (a countable number of) Lipschitz sub-manifolds of appropriate dimension? Attempts to solve this problem has led to theory which has found recent applications in the calculus of variations, the study of free boundary problems, and the geometry of harmonic measure.  The principal investigator intends to further develop tools that serve as a bridge from the analytic condition on the singular integral operator to the geometric structure of the measure. A second topic of research concerns understanding the long-term behavior of a stationary Gaussian process given information about its spectral measure, building upon recent work involving the principal investigator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

""Q-Bio"" stands for Quantitative Biology and reflects the Summer School's goal to combine biological and mathematical methods to understanding the evolution and function of biological cells in health and disease. Individual cells respond to stimuli such as viruses in different (""noisy"") ways, but their interaction is a coordinated immune response which can be predicted using mathematics. Another example is the effect of chemotherapy on leukemias, which may leave small numbers of residual malignant cells and lead to recurrence of disease. Again, it is possible to predict, using mathematics and computer simulations, how and when this may happen.  The q-bio School encourages early career scientists to pursue quantitative systems biology and provides a forum for the exchange of new results and ideas. The unique formula of the School includes active participation in research projects, some of which lead to scientific progress and publications. The Summer School originated in 2007 on the campus of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and past summer schools have been very successful, with over 85% positive reviews and 76% former participants actively engaged in quantitative biology research. The current School at Rice University campus takes advantage of the Houston Health Center, the Baylor College of Medicine and MD Anderson Cancer Center.  The School will be followed by the Annual q-bio Conference at Rice University. Over 11 years the q-bio Summer School has developed an extensive network of 4-500 alumni and actively promotes participant diversity.<br/><br/>Two educational tracks are envisioned in 2018: Cancer Dynamics and Stochastic Cell Regulation. The program will last two weeks and include: ten 1-hour research seminars; ten 1.5-hour general lectures; 30 hours of in-depth breakout discussions, chalk talks and computer lab demonstrations; 8 career-focused panel discussions;  20 student oral presentations; two poster sessions; 20+ hours of mentored project work;  and formal and informal networking opportunities. The Stochastic Cell Regulation track   explores stochasticity and cell-to-cell variability in the measurement and modeling of biochemical systems, concentrating on how small numbers of important molecules (i.e. genes, RNA, and protein) affect dynamics of living cells. The Cancer Dynamics track addresses biological and mathematical issues related to modeling of evolution of cancer. Lectures cover topics spanning many time- and length-scales, from fundamental issues of cell proliferation and mutation dynamics to molecular events affecting specific pathways in cells and population genetics effects.

A primary objective of this project will be to explore aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to fulfill the need for new viral particle purification processes that could reduce the cost of vaccines and be run as a continuous operation. ATPS could also reduce the development time for a new vaccine, allowing for pandemic vaccines to come to market sooner. In addition to vaccines, a better understanding of ATPS could aid in future cell separations for advanced cell therapeutics.<br/><br/>The significant increase in the manufacturing of vaccines worldwide has created an opportunity to re-think current vaccine manufacturing methods. Currently, ATPS is not used industrially due to the large number of variables that need to be determined during the short development timelines that are imposed on vaccine process development teams. The long-term goal of this project is to determine the dominant forces in ATPS for the separation of viral particles to aid industrial adoption. Preliminary work has indicated that hydrophobicity is the dominant force in viral particle separation in a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-citrate ATPS. The expected outcome is to reduce the variables tested in the development of viral particle purification processes and provide a framework to implement ATPS separations. Affinity ATPS will be used to maintain a constant driving force for the virus to partition to the PEG-rich phase. With this constant driving force established, the PEG molecular weight will be changed and the viral separation will be compared to the constant affinity driving force. Osmolytes will be added to the PEG-citrate ATPS to increase the hydrophobicity and to separate the hydrophobicity driving force from the increase in surface tension that restricts virus recovery. All of the work will be integrated by providing a framework using the Design of Experiments (DOE) approach to isolate the hydrophobic effect of viral ATPS. Results of the project will provide a detailed understanding of the driving forces in ATPS that will allow easier implementation of this method for viral particle manufacturing. Through this approach the PI will systematically determine the key variables that control viral particle separations. An important goal is to determine the effect of hydrophobicity on the separation of viruses and to determine the magnitude of the hydrophobic force on the ATPS separation. In terms of the broader impacts, the fundamental knowledge gained from this work may guide the design of low-cost separation and manufacturing processes that will increase access to vaccines worldwide. Importantly, the experimental design framework can be applied to other large biomolecules such as those employed in viral gene therapies and cell therapies.  Outreach to high school students will be conducted through Summer Youth Programs (SYP). The SYP activity will explore the separation of gold nanoparticles in ATPS and teach students about bioprocessing, model systems, and the need for control in ATPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is expected that new curricula and school-wide transformations will have an impact on 5,000-10,000 students from high-need urban public high schools in the city of Milwaukee. The aim is to catalyze a sustainable RET network that empowers teachers to experiment and make STEM learning exciting, grants principals and administration license to support these experiments (and experiment themselves), and, through the industrial element of the program, build the kind of partnerships that would make learning more contextual and help support program growth. <br/><br/>This RET Site offers an intensive seven-week summer experience for 10 teachers per year beginning in late June and ending in early August. The teachers participate in highly structured, team-oriented research projects focused on the water-energy nexus research theme and academic-year curricular development activities. To provide support beyond the classroom, the program will also engage school principals. The teachers' professional development will include a Design Thinking boot camp, curriculum design mentoring, and avatar classroom training. Two RET network conferences will be held annually in which the teachers present their research projects and develop academic-year curriculum. During the first semester of the academic year, the teachers will implement the in-depth six- to eight-week curricular modules that they developed during the summer.  The RET site and its activities directly align with the Milwaukee Public Schools District's Comprehensive Math and Science Plan. It will be evaluated in quantitatively terms of participation, impact on students' knowledge and interest in engineering careers, and their mastery of core science concepts that are targeted by the Design Based Learning (DBL) units. By focusing on the water-energy nexus, a topic of broad social impact that is attractive to high school students, it is hoped that the serious economic issues in Milwaukee related to the continuous decline in the number of K-12 students (particularly females and under-represented minorities) who pursue STEM careers will be addressed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current project leverages the research infrastructure that was supported by prior awards to examine how peer effects, network connections, and employer demand shape career outcomes for doctoral students. It integrates comprehensive administrative data for 113,000 doctoral students, UMETRICS research data, Proquest data on dissertations with information on fields of study and research, and restricted Census Bureau data on earnings and employment outcomes. Dara integration will occur under the umbrella of the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science (IRIS). The project will contribute new knowledge by articulating and testing key aspects of a novel conceptual model of STEM career choices. This theoretical and empirical work will establish basic facts about how demand and training conditions shape early STEM career choices that can be determine only through the integration of separate datasets. The project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>The research design integrates three approaches - peer-based, network-based, and demand. In their peer-based approach, the researchers propose to take the composition of peers in entering graduate cohorts to be quasi-random and estimate how the composition of peers interacts with their own characteristics. A second set of analyses involves identifying labs from the data and estimating how the composition of the persons in a lab relate to outcomes. The network-based approach will be used to examine how individual differences in social capital shape doctoral student outcomes. The demand will answer the analytical question of the effect of actual and perceived labor market demand on the choice of careers. The analysis will begin with a description of the early career outcomes of students from undergraduate dropouts to college graduates, from master's students to Ph.D. dropouts to doctoral recipients.

During the five-year award period, this project aims to fund 156 scholarships for students who are pursuing associate's or bachelor's degrees in the biological sciences. In addition to the scholarships, students will receive faculty and peer mentoring, have access to targeted advising, and participate in summer research opportunities. Each of the partner institutions will also redesign STEM courses in which students often struggle, so that the courses emphasize student-centered learning. Together, these efforts have the potential to increase the number of students graduating with a STEM degree from each partner institution, and prepare these graduates to enter the STEM workforce or pursue further study in STEM. <br/><br/>Limited studies of community college retention appear in the research literature.  Using Tinto's model of integration, this project focuses on several points of attrition that reduce students' academic and social integration into the biological sciences and contribute to reduced retention in STEM careers. At the community college level, academic supports will be critical for maintaining student interest in biology.  High impact supports include faculty mentoring/advising intended to increase successful transfer to the biology major at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, and co-curricular activities such as contact with faculty and peer mentors from UNCC. Once they have transferred to University of North Carolina, Charlotte, scholarship students will benefit academically from co-enrolling in sections of required courses, including organic chemistry and calculus, in which biology majors have historically struggled. To support their success, scholarship students in these courses will have access to peer mentors who have received training about how to address transfer student issues. Other activities include involvement in research opportunities, which has the potential to increase student integration into their campus and scientific communities. The impact of each program component will be investigated via a mixed methods design, to determine the component's impact on integration of transfer students into the UNCC community and degree completion. This research focuses on the interplay between socioeconomic status, gender, and institutional factors that limit or support integration into STEM communities and impact persistence in the biology major.  The results from this research will help to refine existing theories of student integration and contribute to a growing body of work on intersectionality in STEM. Dissemination of these findings may inform the creation of similar discipline-based learning communities for transfer students at UNCC and other public institutions of higher education with large transfer student populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In tandem, undergraduate and graduate students will construct and run a set of citizen science projects aimed at the investigation of particle acceleration in solar flares using data from the past generation of (indirect) hard X-ray observations.  The family of citizen science projects will serve the important purpose of education at the university level and will additionally serve as a solar physics outreach tool as we directly engage the public in high-energy research.  Thus, education, outreach, and research are naturally integrated within the project.  It is intended that these initial citizen science efforts will develop and blossom beyond the extent of this project, opening up citizen science as a platform to analyze the wealth of data provided by multi-wavelength observations of the Sun.  In addition, this project will provide significant support for a relatively new solar physics research group at the University of Minnesota that includes several early-career women, directly affecting the future gender balance of the solar and stellar physics communities.  The research and EPO agenda of this CAREER project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The research program of this five-year CAREER project constitutes an integrated approach to studying particle acceleration and coronal heating associated with impulsive energy releases (flares) on the Sun and other stars.  The main objective is to investigate how high-energy flare properties scale with total energy released by using newly available focused hard X-ray measurements.  This objective will be achieved through three complementary efforts.  Firstly, existing and anticipated data sets from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the Focusing Optics X- ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) will be used to investigate the physics of small microflares on the Sun.  Second, the first set of focused hard X-ray observations of young stellar objects (YSOs) will be analyzed to understand energy release in giant flares.  Finally, a student-built family of citizen science projects will analyze solar flares observed over the last solar cycle by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) in order to unearth new insight into flare particle acceleration.  The research agenda is expected to significantly advance flare knowledge by illuminating the physics of small-scale energy release in sub-A-class microflares -- a regime never before studied at high energies.  Furthermore, the project will utilize never-before-available hard X-ray observations of YSO flares to investigate whether they are governed by the same processes of energy release, particle acceleration, and heating as in solar flares, and will ascertain the aspects of those flares that may have the ability to affect developing planetary systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous brain imaging research has shown that a frontal region called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has an important role in producing subjective value estimates for individual options during decision making. Activity in this region varies with the subjective value of the options under consideration. However, vmPFC also participates in many other cognitive functions, and its internal functional organization is not yet understood in detail. In particular, it is not yet known whether valuation signals originate from the same parts of vmPFC that have been implicated in processes such as memory, planning, and self-referential thinking. The present research will compare the patterns of vmPFC activity associated with valuation and non-valuation processes in individual brains. The results will help develop improved methods for measuring the engagement of specific cognitive processes from brain imaging data. Because vmPFC is thought to encode variables akin to economic utility, this work will contribute to the growing interdisciplinary dialogue between neuroscience and economics. The project will enhance the usefulness of neuroscience methods for understanding economic decision making and thereby contribute to the advancement of societally relevant economic goals. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will create rich educational opportunities for students and trainees involved in conducting the research. <br/><br/>The project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether valuation effects in vmPFC can be topographically segregated from default-mode-network (DMN) effects when examined at the level of the single individual. The project involves a collaboration between researchers with expertise in neuroeconomics and vision science, as a means to import high-fidelity data analysis techniques from visual neuroscience to studies of decision making. Valuation tasks will be interleaved with manipulations of DMN deactivation in a test-retest protocol. Valuation and DMN effects have been shown to be diffusely co-localized within vmPFC in existing meta-analyses, but it is unknown whether they originate from the same or different cortical parcels in individuals. A test-retest design will allow comparisons of activation patterns within and across tasks. One possible outcome is that valuation and DMN effects may turn out to be associated with segregable patterns of cortical engagement. Such a finding would drive the development of sensitive and specific methods for reading out valuation-related activity, and would provide new tools for studying how the brain's valuation system is modulated by learning, context, and the engagement of control processes. An alternative outcome is that valuation and DMN effects may exhibit high topographic correspondence. This outcome would motivate new theoretical models of shared neural operations between these seemingly disparate cognitive processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tomorrow's oceanographers require technological, interdisciplinary training that few undergraduates have experienced. Research Internships in Ocean Science (RIOS), the REU site hosted by the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University, is designed around mentors drawn from an internationally recognized faculty, high caliber research facilities, access to multiple coastal sites, a commitment to undergraduate hands-on research experiences, and strong programs in marine science and outreach. Through independent projects and team research experiences, students focus on process-oriented concepts and techniques applicable in any marine ecosystem. <br/><br/>The Rutgers REU Site will provide a total of twenty-four undergraduates with internships over the two-year period. The goal of RIOS is to enable students interested in ocean sciences to participate in meaningful, interactive research directed by an enthusiastic, experienced group of mentors. Group activities and independent research are embedded within ongoing programs, many of which are focused on the New Jersey continental shelf and adjacent estuaries. At the beginning of each summer internship, a four-day orientation introduces students to ongoing research, focusing on the Raritan River-Raritan Bay and the Mullica River-Great Bay systems. The two estuaries provide a sharp contrast in their human impacts on coastal ecosystems. During the first week, students also consult with mentors, and attend workshops on how to formulate a research question and write a proposal. Students then begin research projects either at the main campus in New Brunswick, NJ or at the Rutgers University Marine Field Station (RUMFS) in Tuckerton, NJ. Students make oral progress reports of their research in a mid-program workshop, receive instruction on how to write up and analyze their data, and how to prepare a poster for the final poster session.<br/><br/>Students will conduct independent research projects with the guidance of research mentors and will participate in a variety of professional development activities, including workshops on scientific ethics, scientific writing, the graduate school experience and career options, as well as field trips and outreach events. The program conducts a national search for applicants and seeks to engage students who are from schools with limited research opportunities. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends, housing and travel to attend the program. This project supports the national goals of developing the next generation of scientists and the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ACC is therefore very important for the transferring and exchanging of heat, freshwater and other properties like carbon and nutrients that impact the marine ecosystem. The Southern Ocean is particularly sensitive to climate variability, responding to winds that have increased and shifted over the past several decades and a significant warming in the core of the ACC.  Yet we still have little understanding about what controls the overall strength of the current as it flows around the Southern Ocean or how the flow and the properties it carries change with depth in the ocean. The proposed work aims to study the processes that might control the changes in strength and depth distribution over a range of temporal and spatial scales using a 20-year time series of currents, temperature and salt in the Drake Passage sector of the Southern Ocean. This work will improve our predictions of how this critical region will respond to future climate change. Given the sparsity of data, the Southern Ocean's role in the climate system in relationship to the impact of global warming and the uptake of carbon dioxide are generally examined using global climate models. Eddy effects must be parameterized in coarse-resolution models, and the parameterizations are generally tested on a very limited observational database. The fine-scale observations in Drake Passage allow for an evaluation of these parameterizations and provide clues for identifying model errors or missing physics so as to build confidence in the detailed model representation of processes and dynamics within the ACC system. The project increases the participation of underrepresented groups in science and technology. It promotes training and learning through the involvement of a graduate student.<br/><br/>The research aims to understand the physical processes that contribute to the circulation in the Southern Ocean, focusing on three central research themes within Drake Passage: (1) Mixing: Characterize the internal wave field and infer mixing from velocity, temperature and salinity observations to understand what determines the vertical and horizontal distribution of mixing; (2) Energy and transport: Determine the mean and time-varying transport of the ACC in the upper 1000 m and determine how the variability relates to changes in wind forcing and presence of eddies; and (3) Property stirring: Understand the eddy energy distribution and its relationship to topographic features, ACC fronts, wind and buoyancy forcing. The proposed analysis will take advantage of underway shipboard measurements of temperature, salinity and velocity profiles that have been routinely collected year-round from the United States Antarctic Supply research vessels in the Drake Passage over the past two decades. Contemporaneous measurements at similar high-resolution time and space scales from the same platform offer significant benefit for exploring the statistical characteristics, features, mechanisms and impacts of the processes that drive the Southern Ocean circulation. Additional measurements from Argo floats and satellite wind and sea surface height data will provide regional context to help interpret the shipboard time series.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For scientific results generated through computation to be considered robust and become widely accepted, the computational techniques should be automated, reproducible and trustworthy. By exploring the practices of gravitational-wave astronomy researchers working on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project, this project seeks to create a set of case studies documenting broadly applicable methods for reproducible computational science. Specifically, the project will explore and articulate what reproducibility, automation, and trust mean with respect to computation-based research in gravitational-wave astronomy, identify, implement and validate a set of experimental practices, that will include computational techniques, and finally, evaluate how these experimental practices can be extended to other science domains. <br/><br/>Robust computational science builds on rigorous methods and is composed of three key elements: (1) reproducibility, which enables the verification and leveraging of scientists' findings; (2) automation, which speeds up the exploration of alternative solutions and the processing of large amounts of data while reducing the introduction of errors; and (3) trust, providing security and reliability for software and data, while supplying the necessary attributes for confidence in the scientist's own results and results from others. This project explores robust science in the LIGO project through the following activities within the context of gravitational-wave astronomy: (1) articulating the roles of reproducibility, automation, and trust in gravitational-wave astronomy; (2) identifying, implementing and validating a set of experimental practices, including computational techniques; and (3) advancing towards the project's vision of general computational methods for robust science by evaluating how the experimental practices can be extended to other science domains. The project will develop and use a survey to collect information about LIGO workflows that are composed of a series of experimental, computational, and data manipulation steps. The analysis of the survey will result in a document that describes what reproducibility means in the LIGO context and help identify potential improvements in LIGO's practices. The project will generalize these findings by documenting a mapping of LIGOs original and enhanced approach to other science workflows including those of the molecular dynamics and bioinformatics communities. The final project document will target a broad audience that includes researchers and students at various levels of education, with the goal of introducing them to the concept of robust computational research, and the underlying concepts of reproducibility, automation and trust, teaching them to access code, data, and workflow information to regenerate findings, learn about the scientific methods, and to engage in STEM research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A highly-skilled, diverse workforce is needed to support this emerging sector. To meet this need, Mohawk Valley Community College will develop an educational model using microcredentials.  These microcredentials will document mastery of specific knowledge and skills related to the unmanned aerial systems industry, and ""stack"" to enable flexible training pathways. This strategy has the potential to help students develop initial competencies, while motivating them to persist toward a certificate or degree. The project will develop curricula for one-semester microcredentials, two-year degrees, and adapt these materials to support noncredit education in technician fields. Close collaborations with the local unmanned aerial systems industry cluster will help ensure that the curriculum meets industry needs. The project team will also work with the industry partners to develop hands-on lab and field exercises, and to foster student internship opportunities. The curriculum and materials developed in this project will be openly available for adaptation or replication at other institutions. The project has the potential to create resources that support education of the unmanned aerial systems workforce across the nation.<br/><br/>The project will aim to develop curriculum for six microcredentials; develop curriculum for two new associate degrees; refine the existing associate degree to align with categories of the microcredentials; and leverage these materials to support courses in unmanned aerial systems applications for emergency services, inspection, and agriculture. The curriculum will focus on preparing students to manufacture and repair unmanned aerial systems as well as analyze data collected on missions. The new associate degrees will be offered in Unmanned Aerial Systems Fabrication and in Unmanned Aerial Systems Electronics. In the new program structure, the microcredentials will be transferable between the degree tracks and accumulation of four microcredentials will be sufficient for students to earn the relevant associate degree. Project-based learning will be integrated through hands-on, industry-relevant student capstone and other projects. The courses will be designed to serve as pathways for current workers toward microcredentials or employment in the unmanned aerial systems sector. The project will conduct extensive outreach and recruitment of underrepresented populations to increase diversity in this technician field. The effectiveness of using microcredentials to address specific workforce skills and gaps will also be evaluated to determine if it can rapidly produce a skilled and diverse technical workforce. The results of the project will be broadly disseminated to assist other colleges in replicating and adapting the use of microcredentials for the unmanned aerial systems sector as well as other high-technology academic and workforce sectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Molten iron sulfides are crucial geochemical and geophysical components of our planet's interior. Their mobility inside the planet has shaped the structure and dynamics of the Earth, and thus, studying the behavior of sulfides at depth is key to understanding the Earth's evolution. The measurements of two properties, electrical conductivity and viscosity, will be conducted on iron sulfide melts over a wide range of pressure and temperature conditions that are relevant to the Earth's upper mantle. When combined with geophysical observations, these results have the potential to detect the presence of sulfide melts at depth and estimate their mobility at small (mm) and large (km) scales, which may lead to the reinterpretation of some geophysical anomalies that are measured on the Earth's surface. The experimental data set will also be relevant to the interior of other terrestrial planets. The research outcomes will be integrated with an extensive education initiative that consists of helping K-12 schoolteachers at the San Diego Unified School District promote earth science research into their courses. The investigator and her group will be working with science education leaders at Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) and San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) to design training workshops for the teachers around the experimental results from this project. Several undergraduate and graduate students, as well as one postdoc researcher will be supported as part of this project.<br/><br/>The interconnectivity and mobility of sulfide melts seem to depend highly on the composition of the melt phase as well as on redox conditions, suggesting that there is a fundamental need to study the effect of melt chemistry and redox conditions on the transport properties of sulfide melts. High-pressure and high-temperature experiments will be conducted up to 10 GPa and up to 1700C at UCSD-SIO and APS-GSECARS. Emphasis will be placed on two parameters affecting sulfide melts' mobility: chemistry and redox conditions. Sample compositions will be in the Fe-S-O-Ni-Cu system and oxygen fugacity will range from IW-1 to IW+4, corresponding to the Iron-Wstite (IW) redox buffer. Experimental results will be applied to different tectonic contexts where the chemistry and redox conditions enhance sulfide melt interconnectivity and where geophysical (seismic, electromagnetic) observations indicate anomalies at different depths in the upper mantle. This investigation of the transport properties of sulfide compounds encompasses mineral physics and geophysics, and is relevant to economic geology (e.g., metal transport related to ore deposit formation), planetary science (e.g., metal-silicate differentiation), as well as metal industry (e.g., strength and plasticity of metal alloys). The education initiative that will be designed around the scientific outcomes of the project supports efforts that integrate next generation earth science standards into instructional practices at the K-12 level. This novel collaboration with science education specialists will have direct impact on the earth science education of SDUSD students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This ""mammoth steppe"" habitat disappeared by 10,000 years ago, along with the megafauna who lived there, but it is still unknown whether their extinction was a cause or an effect of habitat loss. Large herbivores play important roles in maintaining the health of grasslands in modern ecosystems, but the role they played in ice age landscapes is less clear. This project will reconstruct ecological prehistory across Beringia, the ice age land bridge that connected Asia and North America, to establish the timing and nature of extinction, environmental change, and habitat loss. Herbivores remain some of the most threatened animals today, so understanding the ""Serengeti of the ice age"" can help in the management of Earth's largest animals today, and may provide insights into the role native grazers play in a warming Arctic. This project also will provide education, mentoring, and training for students from middle school to graduate school (including a majority first-generation college student population), who will work collaboratively on this project in the field and in the lab. Project results will be incorporated into a student-designed ice age virtual reality game, and implemented in middle schools by newly trained college student ""science ambassadors"" to provide cutting-edge science experiences for students in rural, low-income, communities. The research will be conducted in several protected Arctic locations, including Bering Land Bridge National Reserve, Wrangel Island Reserve (a UNESCO World Heritage site and the last known location of woolly mammoths on Earth), and Pleistocene Park, which also will benefit from these results. <br/><br/>This project aims to understand the relationship between megaherbivores, vegetation, and environmental change in the mammoth steppe, using new high-resolution, multi-proxy records of megaherbivore collapse, paleovegetation, fire, and climate, from four sites in western and eastern Beringia, including the last dated location of woolly mammoths on Earth. Methods include a mix of traditional (e.g., pollen, charcoal) and emerging (ancient DNA, molecular paleoclimate proxies) approaches that will provide opportunities for interdisciplinary training and education in Quaternary environments. These state-of-the-art paleoenvironmental reconstructions will immerse a cooperative team of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in field-based, cross-disciplinary cooperative learning and research experiences based around data-informed ice age virtual reality experiences for middle schoolers, with a goal of broadening participation of rural and first-generation college students in STEM. Results will test and refine hypotheses for the ecological context and consequences of megafaunal extinctions, which have implications for interpreting paleorecords and the conservation of modern keystone species in a warming world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of these structures has numerous applications in various branches of mathematics, computer science and engineering. Consequently, understanding these and other related mathematical structures is important. One of the techniques in the study of these structures, probabilistic reasoning, has been crucial in the development of modern algorithms and the design of robust, efficient, and economical communication networks. Another application of probabilistic reasoning in discrete mathematics is based on the fact that one can decompose deterministic objects into pieces that share many properties with randomly generated objects. This general approach, pioneered by E. Szemeredi, has been generalized and enriched in the last couple of decades, and is now one of the central methods in the investigation of large graphs and hypergraphs.<br/><br/>The PI plans to work on Turan-, Dirac-, and Ramsey-type questions for graphs and hypergraphs. A considerable part of the research proposed by the PI will employ, among others, the methodology mentioned above. A prime example is the investigation of Turan densities. Most of the other problems also fall within the theory of hypergraphs and are focused on questions in Ramsey theory and extremal combinatorics.

But, because we cannot look at the machines or their parts directly, some of the details are incorrect.  The methods produce incorrect details in part because they were developed in the 'pre-genome' era, when our parts lists were far less complete, and in part because we use the parts-list from one organism (mouse) to help us identify the parts in another organism (rat).  But, if the first set of parts (protein sequences) has errors, those errors can end up in the second set, and as more organisms are studied, the errors multiply.  Incorrect protein sequences make it more difficult to identify mutations that may be associated with cancer and other diseases.  Today, protein sequence quality control largely relies on the accuracy of other protein sequences.  This proposal seeks to greatly expand the types of information used to confirm that the details (sequences) of the cellular machinery are correct, and to collaborate with the Uniprot protein sequence database to ensure that incorrect sequences are corrected and so that future analyses do not repeat mistakes.  The proposed research will increase researchers' confidence that exciting differences between phenotypes, such as diseased and normal cells, or different strains of food crops, are genuine, and not the result of mistaken protein sequences.<br/><br/><br/>The UniProt Reference protein sets are a critical resource, providing a foundation for advances in genome biology, structure/function prediction, and personalized medicine. But Reference protein sets have characteristic errors that can be amplified in genome annotation, reducing the accuracy of functional annotation and similarity search sensitivity. This project is a collaboration with the Uniprot protein resource that will develop novel strategies for identifying protein sequence errors; these strategies will be incorporated into the Uniprot annotation pipelines to remove erroneous sequences from Reference databases. Initially, errors will be found by integrating exon-boundary and Pfam domain annotations into BLAST-based similarity search results to identify currently recognized errors, such as missing/additional exons and partial domains. In addition, strategies will be developed to detect currently unrecognized errors, by clustering similar proteins and looking for 'outliers'. Lists of 'suspect' protein sequences will be examined by Uniprot annotators and classified as true or mistaken errors, and successful error detection strategies will be refined and integrated into the Uniprot annotation pipeline, reducing functional annotation errors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve safe, resilient, and self-improving autonomous navigation, this project focuses on the design of adaptive online environment understanding that guarantees stable and collision-free operation in challenging conditions. The proposed research is important because current practices rely on prior maps or hand-crafted online mapping that attempt to capture the whole environment, even if parts are irrelevant for specific navigation tasks. This increases memory and computation requirements, spreads the effects of noise, and makes current approaches brittle, particularly in conditions involving dynamic obstacles, unreliable localization, or illumination variation.<br/><br/>The proposal offers two technical innovations to achieve safe autonomous navigation. First, it develops a learnable neural map based on 3-D convolution over hierarchical (octree) partitioning of space to extract navigation-specific features and on differentiable memory to infer long-term dependence among the features. The neural map parameters are trained from navigation experience not to produce accurate maps but to quantify the collision probabilities of intended motion trajectories accurately. The second innovation is a Lyapunov-theoretic control approach that uses the total energy of an autonomous system with respect to a virtual kinematic system (that can stop immediately) to derive conditions that guarantee stable and collision-free tracking of the trajectories proposed by the neural network. The proposed learnable neural map significantly increases the robustness of collision prediction, while the Lyapunov-theoretic control guarantees stable and safe navigation in new, unpredictable, and cluttered environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scholars of non-food producing societies have noted close ties between resource availability and the organization of forager societies. In temperate regions, change among hunter-gatherers is often related to shifts in the amount of wild foods available during the year. In areas like the African tropics where resources do not vary significantly from season to season, climatic oscillations over hundreds or thousands of years are more important drivers of social and economic change in small scale human societies. The ways that broad shifts in climate patterns affect social strategies employed by people relying on wild resources in the tropics, however, are not well understood. The deep time perspective of archaeology provides a useful lens for investigating such shifts over long periods of time. This study will use archaeological data to examine the ways small-scale, non-food producing societies adapted to well-known climatic fluctuations over the last 20,000 years in eastern Africa. Findings will provide new information on the role that hunter-gatherer social flexibility had in shaping the social diversity of prehistoric eastern Africa.

The study of isotopes preserved in human skeletal remains provide a valuable means to identify the geographic origins of individuals or groups buried in archeological contexts suggesting warfare, offering evidence that can corroborate other archaeological and biological indicators (fortifications, village destruction, traumatic skeletal injury, etc.). Even so, refinement of isotopic methods is required to improve the confidence of results. Lead (Pb) is a toxic trace metal that affects the health of biological organisms, but its composition can also indicate from where an individual originates. Pb isotopes preserved in human tooth enamel provide a signature, via food chain pathways, of the geographic area in which that individual was born and grew up. This study will establish and demonstrate a new method for biological sourcing, the biological available Pb method, which compares the Pb isotopes of prehistoric human and non-migratory animal populations to determine if humans found in the archaeological record of one area are local or actually came from another region. This will aid researchers who commonly question whether particular burials or mortuary treatments, such as isolated skulls and mandibles, reflect special burial treatment of honored ancestors or the disposal of dismembered enemies from other regions. This study will test if late prehistoric Caddo communities in southwest Arkansas were committing large-scale acts of violence against neighboring regions. Concurrent archeological evidence of increased violence in the Southern Plains and the Eastern Woodlands may reflect increasing tensions between regions. Alternatively, unusual burial treatments often attributed to warfare might indicate alternative practices involving transport of partial skeletal remains for special burial at important regional centers. This study also serves the practical purpose of determining cultural affiliation for the purposes of Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act compliance and to inform and encourage feedback from descendant communities including the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. The study also has practical forensic applications for determining points of geographic origin for human skeletal material recovered from multiple present day/recent contexts.<br/><br/>Mr. Samuelsen, under the supervision of Dr. George Sabo III, will employ Pb and strontium (Sr) isotope analysis to evaluate early lifetime locations for the remains of 352 individuals represented in a skull-and-mandible cemetery (A.D. 1253-1399) at the Crenshaw site in southwest Arkansas, as part of his dissertation research. This will be accomplished through the creation of a comparative multi-state map of biologically available Pb/Sr isotopic ratios from states surrounding Arkansas. This map will be compared to Pb/Sr isotopic ratios from the human and animal remains from Crenshaw and other southwest Arkansas sites. High resolution Pb and Sr isotopes will be obtained using a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at the University of Arkansas. The resulting data, whether indicating local or foreign origin, will illustrate how biological Pb isotopes can be analyzed, how they can reveal the purpose behind specialized burial treatments, and demonstrate how isotopes like Pb and Sr can help evaluate the prevalence and extent of many ancient cultural practices including interregional warfare and specialized mortuary practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Public policies could improve the lives of families dealing with these issues, but the intended impacts of these policies may not be achieved if families respond to policies in unpredictable ways. Moreover, policies with overlapping goals that are targeted at the same families could either work together to benefit these families or work against each other. Understanding how these policies comprehensively affect families---working independently or together---is essential for informing government spending decisions, and thereby advancing national health, prosperity, and welfare. This CAREER research program combines multiple large-scale data sets with experimental research methods to better understand the effects of public policies on family outcomes and promote the progress of economic science.  Specifically, the research project will study the effects of paid family leave, joint custody laws, and major U.S. social safety net programs on family outcomes. This proposal's education plan centers on training students---especially women, who are under-represented in the economics profession---to shape the next generation of researchers who will be involved in public policy.  The results of this research project will have profound influence on the conduct of public policy towards families, hence increase the well-being of Americans. <br/><br/>This CAREER research project has four components. The first project uses population-level administrative data to estimate the impacts of California's paid family leave (PFL) benefits on leave duration, labor market outcomes, and repeat leave-taking among new parents with a regression kink research design. This project provides some of the first estimates of the effects of the PFL benefit amount, holding other policies constant. The second project will identify the causal effects of joint legal custody, which grants both parents the right to make key decisions about their children's welfare and is increasingly promoted by legislation in the developed world, on family outcomes. This project will use Danish administrative data on custody court cases linked to four other administrative data sets to track the economic, family formation, and mental and physical health outcomes of the parents and children in each case. To identify causality, the project will leverage random assignment of custody cases to judges, who differ in their propensity to grant joint legal custody. The third project will analyze the long-term effects of U.S. safety net programs with data on millions of current adults, focusing on two questions: (i) Do safety net programs ameliorate adverse long-term consequences of early childhood economic shocks? (ii) Do these programs complement or substitute each other in their long-term impacts on adult outcomes? The analysis will use difference-in-difference and event-study designs, exploiting variation from the county-by-county rollout of major programs, and variation in local labor demand. The fourth component is a mentoring workshop that connects female economics PhD students with mentors who are in the early stages of their careers both within and outside academia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will examine abilities assumed by prevailing theories to be universal by studying mathematical learning in the Tsimane', a unique population of farming-foragers. The extreme variability in their exposure to formal education will provide the researchers with an opportunity to evaluate the roles of education, age, maturity, and core cognitive systems in driving early mathematical development. The project will involve multiple methodologies from ethnographic studies of number use in Tsimane' life, to assessments of basic cognitive resources such as working memory, to tests of mathematical knowledge. The team will conduct studies of matched samples of children from 2 to 12 years of age in the US who grow up in impoverished learning environments. The goal is to identify which cognitive components of number competence ought to be targeted by future interventions so as to improve learning in US children living in poverty or who face learning delays. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning. <br/><br/>Many abilities are related to numeracy and number sense, including knowledge of sets, the number words, counting, 1-1 correspondence, spatial relations, and approximate number estimation. Yet, it is not known which of these capacities are the foundations of early number growth and which are the consequence of number acquisition or other cultural factors. This proposal will seek to discover the cognitive underpinnings of number in an indigenous population, the Tsimane'. The key scientifically-relevant features of this population are the extreme variability in their formal educational system -- some children receive no formal education -- and that they progress through the stages of number learning at a protracted timescale, taking 3-4 times as long other children in the locale and children in the United States. Other children have longer, formal education.  The high variability in education, age, and parental numeracy in this population will allow many of the components related to number growth to be disentangled as causal factors to an unusual extent. The team will use anthropological methods to document the cultural context and use of number in order to understand what practices support its acquisition and predict children's knowledge. They will also use a series of simple experimental tasks drawn from the mathematics education and cognitive science literatures to assess numerical development and chart the trajectory of Tsimane' number learning in detail. The goal is to develop a unifying computational model of number learning that can be used rapidly to predict which future interventions will be most promising in helping to improve learning in US children, especially those living in disadvantaged learning environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By investigating the discrete integrability of these systems, the investigators expect to produce conserved quantities, so far achieved only in type A. In turn, these should lead to difference equations for the graded characters of tensor product product, which generalize the difference Toda equations. Moreover, the solutions of these equations can be expressed as iterated action of difference creation operators, closely related to generalized Macdonald operators defined within the context of polynomial representations of double affine Hecke algebras.

In the natural world, materials often spontaneously change their state. For example, on a warm day, solid ice melts to become liquid water. However, ice cubes don't melt all at once; instead, they melt at the surface. Scientists study the process of melting, therefore, by understanding the properties of the surface between the solid and liquid, termed the solid/liquid interface, and the processes that take place there.<br/>The characteristics of the solid/liquid interface depend on the molecular structure, and molecules are very small, very fast, and very difficult to control. In this project, the research team will develop a new computer simulation method that slows down the molecular motions in a controlled manner so that the team can extract information about the interfacial properties and processes in solids and liquids. The results will help scientists better understand melting and freezing, which is important in metal casting and in 3D printing. In addition, the research team will study solid/solid interfaces, which occur in diverse materials from batteries to steel, and solid/vapor interfaces, which influence the production of electronic materials.<br/>Computer simulations of this type are increasingly important to support scientific and technological advancement. To prepare the materials science workforce in these new methods, this project will help train bachelors, masters, and doctoral students in the principles of computational materials science. Furthermore, to maximize the impact of this work, the methods and results of this project will be available to all interested scientists.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education on interfaces in materials which may be in different states. An interface is a planar defect that occurs at the intersection of materials that differ in state, phase, crystal orientation, magnetic spin, atomic ordering, or any other structural parameter. Because interfaces represent a disruption in electronic, magnetic, or atomic structure, they contribute a positive free energy to the system. Thus, if an interface is mobile, it will move so as to minimize the total system free energy. When an interface moves, it interacts with other interfaces, with internal and external fields, and with geometric boundary conditions, continuously altering its configuration. As its local environment evolves, the interface structure, shape, and rate-limiting motion mechanism may change as well. Such collective interactions ensure that in real materials, interfaces rarely attain metastable equilibrium configurations. <br/>Because interfaces mediate the thermal, electrical, mechanical, optical, chemical, and functional properties of materials, materials scientists study their thermodynamics and kinetics. However, nearly all methods are limited to interfaces that are in metastable equilibrium configurations and cannot be applied to the mobile, evolving interfaces that occur during material processing. The goal of this work is to develop a new approach for obtaining the true free energy and absolute mobility of interfaces at and away from equilibrium in order to enable physical discovery, provide deeper understanding of mechanisms and outcomes, and link to mesoscale material processes.<br/>A new method for calculating finite temperature interfacial free energy and mobility is proposed. Termed driving force balanced molecular dynamics (DFB-MD) method, it relies on balancing two or more known driving forces, yielding a system of equations that can be solved for interface free energy and mobility. One driving force is synthetic, thus imposed upon the system; the other(s) may include curvature, chemical, stress, magnetic, defect, or other contributions. Because the interface need not be in an equilibrium configuration, the properties of curved and/or moving boundaries can be obtained. These materials properties may then be used to inform materials models at larger length and time scales or to interpret experimental observations.<br/>The DFB-MD approach may be generalized to other system geometries, driving forces, and processes. By defining an appropriate order parameter and applying a known excess energy based on that parameter, the motion of many types of interfaces - potentially including other defects - may be altered. This ability to influence the motion of a moving interface has the potential to offer insight into a number of open problems involving complex processes, including dislocation motion, grain growth and coarsening, precipitation, crystal growth, and vacancy formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hence understanding the origin of continents and how portions of them remain stable for billions of years is central to understanding the evolution of the Earth. The old, stable cores of continents (cratons) are underlain by thick layers of mantle (the silicate layer of the Earth that lies below the crust), and these mantle roots are thought to contribute to continental stability. Yet, it remains debated how the continental mantle formed and evolved. In particular, the roles of magma or fluid interaction with the mantle, either during or after the continent formation, are unclear, although widespread layering observed in the cratonic mantle by seismic imaging may have been created by magma and fluid related processes. This research will constrain the formation and evolution of cratons by bracketing scenarios of melt/fluid and mantle reactions that are consistent with geophysical observations at mid-lithospheric depths. The research findings - disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and colloquia, and class room lectures and activities - will impact a wide range of Earth science sub-disciplines including petrology-geochemistry, mineral physics, geodynamics, and seismology. The proposal will support female PhD students in high P-T experimental petrology, mineral physics, and seismology, and support the research activities of several undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups.

The proposal will thus directly further the educational experience and professional development of several students at various stages of their careers. The proposed research will also support an early career PI in the field of mineral physics and will aid the investigators in engaging K-12 students in science.<br/><br/>The stability of the continental interiors for 2-3 billion years is a key feature of the Earth's dynamical and thermal evolution. Understanding the geophysical structure, petrology, and material properties of cratonic mantles and the tectonic history that produced them is therefore one of the grand challenges of Earth science. A curious feature of subcontinental mantles is the presence of distinct reductions in seismic shear velocity at depths of 60-150 km, often called mid-lithospheric discontinuities (MLDs). Given the widespread occurrence of MLDs within cratons, their origins may be linked to craton formation; however, the causal link between MLD and craton formation is yet to be established, and MLD origins remain highly debated. One hypothesis is that MLDs represent zones enriched in CO2-H2O volatiles, which led to stability of hydrous and/or carbonate minerals or partial melts. This project will test this hypothesis by integrating results from experimental petrology, mineral physics, and seismology. Through laboratory experiments, this project will constrain the phase equilibria of cratonic mantle peridotites fluxed by mixed CO2-H2O volatiles at MLD depths, taking into consideration how the agent of volatile introduction may vary with craton formation models. The goal will be to determine the stability of hydrous and carbonate mineral phases over partial melts and obtain the compositions and proportions of mineral phases as a function of depth, temperature, and melt/fluid:peridotite ratio for each of the cases. Guided by the phase equilibria experiments and compiled xenolith data, thermoelastic properties of the appropriate end members and intermediate solid solutions of amphibole and mica will be determined using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) and first principles simulation. Using the mineral assemblages from experiments and updated elasticity data from new mineral physics, mantle velocity models will be predicted. These will be compared to mantle models for southern African craton (to be obtained by joint inversion of surface wave, Sp and Ps data) and North America, and used to calculate synthetic Sp and Ps receiver function stacks that will be compared to MLD observations globally. The proposed research will test whether one or several scenarios of fluid/melt infiltration into cratons, if any, satisfy the geophysical and petrologic characters of continental mantles at mid-lithospheric depths. Our research will also lead to specific products such as solidus parameterizations of depleted mantle+CO2+H2O; metasomatized mantle mineral assemblages as a function of P-T, infiltrated fluid/melt composition and fluid/melt:rock ratio; codes for computing seismic velocities for MLD-related assemblages with updated thermoelastic data; and observed mantle discontinuity parameters and mantle velocity models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes as well as others form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project focuses on the continued development and operation of new instrumentation for a detector based on liquid argon and the invention and incorporation of new analytical techniques to search for the so-called sterile neutrino, whose existence is suggested by BSM theories. <br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which furthers the development and impact of LArTPC technology applications, using the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL. This experiment will further the study of potential signals of sterile neutrinos. Sterile neutrinos are proposed BSM particles that could explain aspects of cosmology and astrophysics such as Dark Matter. MicroBooNE is in the process of making a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the ""low-energy excess"" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment. There have been recent ""hints"" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with its superior LArTPC detector, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence. <br/><br/>The PI's Group has broader impacts aspects that address development of a globally competitive STEM workforce; increased participation of women and minorities; improved teacher development; improved undergraduate education; and increased public scientific literacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From autonomous vehicles to medical devices, the ability to collect and analyze large quantities of data is changing the world. The goal of this research project is to create a new mathematical and computational framework for integrating distributed and multimodal sensor data into multiple types of emerging models in data science and machine learning so as to extract more information from data. The project team includes researchers from diverse disciplines who will address problems ranging from physical science and medicine to consumer imaging and industrial inspection. The research will result in theories, algorithms, and open software that can be used to integrate information from heterogeneous sensing systems to estimate and reconstruct signals and images.<br/><br/>The framework for model-data integration is based on a new theory of Multi-Agent Consensus Equilibrium (MACE). MACE allows for modular integration of multi-modal physical sensor information with information derived from data science models. At the core of this approach is the computational solution of the consensus equilibrium equations. These equations balance distributed sensor information with prior knowledge provided by machine learning models. The MACE framework is a generalization of the more traditional Bayesian or regularized inverse approach, but it allows for the use of non-traditional data science models such as deep convolutional neural networks in the solution of sensing and imaging problems. This project's contributions are in four areas: Thrust 1: Foundational Theoretical Methods; Thrust 2: Robust Sensor and Data Model Integration; Thrust 3: Multimodal and Networked MACE; and Thrust 4: Automated Experimentation.

This CAREER project seeks to design, implement, and evaluate heterogeneous sensor systems in smart homes that help ameliorate the progressive functional and behavioral health decline of older adults. The work specifically looks at cross-domain approaches that can accommodate variability in behavior, activity, and physiological health conditions across a large population and diverse set of smart home sensor systems. The inability to build scalable and adaptable activity and behavior monitoring models across domains such as multi-occupant homes with heterogeneous internet-of-things devices is a major impediment to adoption of smart home technologies for healthcare applications. The project develops novel deep transfer learning techniques, optimization-based heuristics, opportunistic sensing architecture, and spatiotemporal dynamical systems-based approaches to address the diversity, adaptability, and reliability of activity and behavior recognition models across different users and technologies, while leveraging a human-in-the-loop control for improving the performance of the sensor systems. These techniques will help automate activity and physiological health monitoring at scale, and thereby improve the design and study of adaptive interventions for elderly people, their families, and professional caregivers. <br/><br/>In order to realize autonomous health assessment methodologies in practice, it is necessary to build an activity and behavior recognition system across multiple inhabitants and various connected consumer devices that can select, adapt, and cope with device and user heterogeneities, privacy characteristics, resource constraints and scarcity of labeled data. To address the above-mentioned problems, this research project contributes to new methodology in four ways. First, it is introducing deep transfer learning activity recognition model and multi-user multi-device optimization-based heuristics that automatically help adapt the inherent variations across different domains, including user/device-type/device-instance. Second, it is designing a spatio-temporal dynamical system approach based on fractal dynamics to mitigate the variability in various sensor signals, and capture the self-similarity of human physiological health markers and establish the parametric task performance dependency between functional and behavioral health measurements. Third, it posits an opportunistic sensing architecture and human-in-the loop activity model for real-time data sharing and annotation that help optimize the user interruption and system performance. Fourth, it is designing a distributed implementation of tailored-computational techniques in actual smart home deployments, and evaluating the effectiveness of sensor-based functional and behavioral models and algorithms for just-in-time health assessment in actual living environments. In addition to the targeted focus on education, an ongoing collaboration with the University of Maryland, School of Nursing is being leveraged for real deployment of smart home sensor systems and technologies at three retirement community centers and senior homes in the greater Baltimore area to compound the impact of proposed evidence-based research efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The deep-time history of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere may help us quantify the role of this greenhouse gas in abrupt climate change events in the geological past, giving a better perspective towards climate projections under future scenarios of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. This project will refine proxy estimates of atmospheric carbon dioxide that are based on an understanding of how the properties of stomatal pores in the leaves of Ginkgo trees respond to elevated carbon dioxide concentration. This proxy relationship, established using controlled experiments on cultivated Ginkgo leaves, will then be applied to the ancient record of atmospheric carbon dioxide using fossil Ginkgo leaves that are common in sediments deposited during periods when Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and climate varied substantially. These more precise estimates of ancient atmospheric carbon dioxide will thus help to refine our understanding of the sensitivity of Earth's climate system to greenhouse gas concentrations and facilitate more accurate projections of changes in climate, ice volume and sea level that will result from anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. More accurate projections of these future scenarios will have significant societal and economic implications for infrastructure and food production. The project will also educate students and citizen scientists about the scientific method and insights from this research by involving them in collecting specimens, making measurements and analyzing data.<br/><br/>Sensitivity of global temperature to atmospheric pCO2 is difficult to determine by direct atmospheric measurements because feedbacks in the Earth system play out over millennia or longer. This research will develop a reliable, temporally dense proxy record of pCO2 for the late Paleocene and Early Eocene period of warm climates (~60-53 Ma) using stomatal properties of fossil Ginkgo leaves. The researchers will first refine a proxy relationship between Ginkgo leaf stomatal properties, and then apply this proxy to dense and temporally well-constrained fossil records of Ginkgo.  To establish the response of modern Ginkgo to elevated pCO2 concentrations, trees will be cultivated under experimental conditions at three elevated CO2 concentrations in open-top chambers, while monitoring stomatal density, size and index, as well as carbon isotopic composition and rates of photosynthetic assimilation and transpiration, temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation. These data from experimental cultivation will be used along with survey data of modern Ginkgo leaves, to allow the researchers to evaluate modeled relationships between paleo-pCO2 and fossil stomata. Once this response is calibrated for modern Ginkgo biloba, the results will be applied to extensive collections of fossil Ginkgo wyomingensis from the terrestrial sediments of the Paleogene in the Rocky Mountains. This record, combined with records of paleotemperature from the marine and terrestrial realms will be used to evaluate the role of atmospheric CO2 during episodes of geologically rapid temperature increases (hyperthermals).  Better estimates of paleo-pCO2 will contribute substantially to refining our understanding of Earth's climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide and increase our understanding of controls on past warm climates in the geological record.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much research uses the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to map phenotypes onto genotypes. This project will begin by characterizing a set of traits that capture core aspects of life history for ~250 related species of Drosophila. These analyses will be complemented by mapping genotype-phenotype relationships across the 30 species of Drosophila with fully-sequenced genomes.  All data will be made available through a public database. This resource will enable strategic decisions about future genome sequencing priorities. Furthermore, the database will assist the integrated study of diverse life history traits in the context of both resource ecology and phylogeny. <br/><br/>Using standardized protocols, all ~250 species of Drosophila and related genera (Samoaia, Scaptomyza, Zaprionus and Gitona) maintained by the Drosophila Species Stock Center will be phenotyped for a set of 18 morphological, behavioral, physiological and developmental traits, Collectively, these traits capture core aspects of sexual selection and life-history syndromes, in addition to providing characters relevant to ecological selection. These data form the basis for a valuable public database on Drosophila ""evolutionary phenomics,"" along with accompanying phylogenetic resources.

During the five-year award period, this project aims to fund 156 scholarships for students who are pursuing associate's or bachelor's degrees in the biological sciences. In addition to the scholarships, students will receive faculty and peer mentoring, have access to targeted advising, and participate in summer research opportunities. Each of the partner institutions will also redesign STEM courses in which students often struggle, so that the courses emphasize student-centered learning. Together, these efforts have the potential to increase the number of students graduating with a STEM degree from each partner institution, and prepare these graduates to enter the STEM workforce or pursue further study in STEM. <br/><br/>Limited studies of community college retention appear in the research literature.  Using Tinto's model of integration, this project focuses on several points of attrition that reduce students' academic and social integration into the biological sciences and contribute to reduced retention in STEM careers. At the community college level, academic supports will be critical for maintaining student interest in biology.  High impact supports include faculty mentoring/advising intended to increase successful transfer to the biology major at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, and co-curricular activities such as contact with faculty and peer mentors from UNCC. Once they have transferred to University of North Carolina, Charlotte, scholarship students will benefit academically from co-enrolling in sections of required courses, including organic chemistry and calculus, in which biology majors have historically struggled. To support their success, scholarship students in these courses will have access to peer mentors who have received training about how to address transfer student issues. Other activities include involvement in research opportunities, which has the potential to increase student integration into their campus and scientific communities. The impact of each program component will be investigated via a mixed methods design, to determine the component's impact on integration of transfer students into the UNCC community and degree completion. This research focuses on the interplay between socioeconomic status, gender, and institutional factors that limit or support integration into STEM communities and impact persistence in the biology major.  The results from this research will help to refine existing theories of student integration and contribute to a growing body of work on intersectionality in STEM. Dissemination of these findings may inform the creation of similar discipline-based learning communities for transfer students at UNCC and other public institutions of higher education with large transfer student populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SSAs have many advantages over conventional Hard Disk Drives (HDD), such as enhanced input/output (IO) performance and storage density, lower power, cooling, and rack space cost. However, SSAs have lower endurance and lower lifetime than HDDs, requiring more frequent replacement, negating some of their advantages.<br/><br/>To optimize the lifespan of SSAs, this project will divide data into two separate classes, hereafter described as ordinary data and approximate data. With approximate storage, bad blocks that contain pages with uncorrectable errors can be reused to store approximate data that can tolerate some errors. Applying approximate storage in SSAs requires new mechanisms and techniques to coordinate redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) and SSD controllers to manage both approximate and ordinary data. This project will (1) develop new mechanisms to orchestrate control between RAID and SSD controllers to extend the lifespan of SSAs; (2) investigate new schemes to utilize the computing power of SSDs to accelerate the data reconstruction of SSAs under heavy workloads; and (3) integrate the above two approaches to develop an experimental framework for evaluation. This project is expected to have a major impact on industry, since it addresses a real, very timely technical problem. Further, this project has societal benefits, in reducing storage cost at data centers, educating graduate and undergraduate students about cloud computing architecture, while seeking to broaden participation of students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upon colonization of new environments, however, physiological systems that evolved in one environmental context may produce misdirected responses when they are inappropriately coopted to respond to novel challenges. Prominent examples of this phenomenon include several physiological responses to high-elevation environments in native lowlanders. For example, exposure to high elevation induces excessive red blood cell production, constriction of pulmonary blood vessels, and other physiological changes in lowlanders that may be considered maladaptive because they contribute to high-altitude diseases (e.g. chronic mountain sickness, pulmonary edema). In such cases, natural selection should favor attenuation of these maladaptive responses. This research focuses on understanding the evolutionary, physiological, and genetic mechanisms that allow such maladaptive ancestral responses to blunted, without simultaneously impacting beneficial responses. The project PIs will use a series of acclimation experiments and field studies of high- and low-altitude populations of deer mice to explore the adaptive modification of physiological responses to high-altitude stressors. Like indigenous high-elevation human populations, highland deer mice exhibit blunted maladaptive responses to hypoxia. The results of this research will also be used to develop a public outreach program that illustrates the value of comparative physiology for informing applied problems in human health using high-altitude environments and the animals that inhabit them as its centerpiece. These outreach efforts will be centered on the development of short films that will serve as springboards for interactive discussions between researchers and the general public.<br/><br/>Many physiological responses to hypoxia are largely coordinated by a family of master transcription factors, known as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF1-3). Because mutations that alter the function of transcription factors like HIF (i.e. trans-regulatory mutations) are prone to pleiotropic effects, evolutionary theory suggests that they should be rare in the adaptive modification of regulatory networks compared to changes that are more modular in their phenotypic effects. Nonetheless, recent genomic studies of high-elevation human populations, and several other species have shown that allelic variation in a gene (EPAS1) that encodes a specific HIF isoform (HIF2) has been the target of natural selection, and is associated with the attenuation of maladaptive responses to hypoxia. Thus, adaptive modification of regulatory networks that coordinate hypoxia responses seems to have repeatedly proceeded through modification of trans-regulatory factors in high-elevation specialists. This poses interesting physiological and evolutionary questions because HIF2 also coordinates a number of beneficial physiological changes to maintain O2 homeostasis. Given that alteration of HIF2 induce deleterious pleiotropic effects, how can maladaptive responses be attenuated while adaptive responses are maintained? Does alteration of HIF function require compensatory cis-regulatory mutations in HIF targets that coordinate adaptive responses or can compensatory modifications be achieved through epigenetic changes? This research will address these questions using a series of physiological, genetic, and transcriptomic experiments on highland and lowland deer mice. Like other highland specialists, patterns of allele frequency variation at EPAS1 suggest local adaptation in deer mice, and this variation is associated with the attenuation of maladaptive hypoxia responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed work examines correlations between mid ocean ridge basalt (MORB) chemistry and images of Earth's interior produced using seismic tomography. It uses large-scale numerical models of mantle flow to connect surface observations with past and present mantle structure. The proposed work has three components. First, it examines the distributions of helium isotopes and other geochemical indicators of mantle temperature at spreading centers and how these are related to temperature and compositional variations in the sub-oceanic mantle. Second, it explores the flow history of mantle material that is sampled at spreading centers. Third, it addresses how the mid ocean ridges in different ocean basins have sampled the mantle since the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea. The project will provide new information about how variations in seismic velocity beneath the ocean basins are related to the variations in chemical composition of MORB, and how upper mantle variations in composition and temperature are related to deeper mantle structure.<br/><br/>Different disciplines make distinct contributions to our understanding of the dynamics of Earth's mantle. In particular, relating the distribution of geochemical and seismological heterogeneity at the global scale has been a challenge because of the different wavelengths sampled in these two types of approaches: local, for geochemistry, long wavelength, for seismology. Recently, progress has been made in both fields, with resolution reaching sub-1000 km scale in global seismic tomography, and a more complete geochemical sampling along mid-ocean ridges, allowing the investigation of patterns at wavelengths commensurate with the seismic imaging. Concurrently, progress has been made in developing methodologies for realistic geodynamic modeling of mantle circulation in 3D, incorporating constraints from seismology and surface observables (e.g. plate motions, topography, and the geoid). Tying these elements together to better constrain the flow history of material sampled at ridges is becoming feasible at the present time. The proposed work will produce new geochemical datasets, tomographic models, and results from geodynamic models that will be distributed to the broader geoscience community for further analysis and in a format that permits immersive 3D visualization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this project is to enable the transition to sustainable FEWS by achieving the multi-factorial assessment of tradeoffs needed to achieve sustainability. This project will build a U.S.- China collaboration framed as a Virtual Research Center (FEWS-VRC) between Purdue University and three Chinese academic institutions (Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, and Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy). <br/><br/>FEWS-VRC will push the frontier of quantitative systems sustainability analysis in two directions: 1) assessing the role of heterogeneity by extending the use of gridded modeling of agricultural production coupled with land-water use; and 2) analysis of interactions between agriculture and new sources of energy, particularly bio-based energy. The tools developed will be built on a Science Gateway platform (FEWS-HUB) that will provide a quantitative, extensible basis for solving crucial future research and planning problems thus improving decision-making capabilities in FEWS topics within the world's two largest economies. Though the integrated assessment approach, this project will add to existing knowledge in several dimensions: gridded modeling of agricultural production; and coupling of the gridded agricultural model to a detailed general equilibrium model. Spatial models at a national level are too coarse to deal with the heterogeneity of agricultural production. Moreover, as water is ever more becoming a constraining factor for agriculture, it is vital to link agricultural production and hydrological models at basin scale. An expected outcome of this study is a framework to assess the importance of gridded-level heterogeneity as well as potential 'hotspots' linked to water availability. A second goal is coupling the Purdue-developed ENVISAGE Model to SIMPLE-G thus extending the latter model to include energy systems. ENVISAGE is an integrated assessment model with a large energy sub-module that provides an assessment of changes in bio-based energy including land-use implications. Coupling these two disparate models will allow new research questions to be addressed in a tractable and traceable framework. Sustainable development is a globally acknowledged grand challenge problem so improving observational and predictive capabilities in the FEWS framework will have positive impacts on food, water, energy, and national security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are not directly accessible due to their depth of formation, or because these magmas have long since solidified, leaving behind minerals.  Thus, the chemistry of the resulting minerals need to be used as proxies, to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of these magmas and fluids.  One key variable that remains poorly explored in the accessory group of minerals (e.g., zircon, monazite, and apatite) is the oxygen ""pressure"" of the magma or fluid from which they crystallized.  The goal of this research is to calibrate and understand how the chemistry of these minerals changes in response to changes in the oxygen pressures.  These calibrations will take place in a laboratory setting enabling the synthesis of minerals under precision-controlled conditions. Such experiments will serve as stepping stones to explore the formation environment of natural minerals.  The accessory minerals zircon, monazite, and apatite are specifically targeted because they are excellent recorders of absolute time.  This is so because they structurally accommodate radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium.  Thus, changes in the oxygen pressure of a magma can, for example, be explored as a function of time.  Oxygen pressure is an important variable in Earth studies because it influences mineral saturation and stability (including economically important minerals) and the viscosity of magmas.  Because of this, quantifying the oxygen pressure of past systems, including ancient volcanic systems, will lead to new knowledge to that may help explain why volcanoes erupt.  Second, the types of volatiles present during an eruption depends on oxygen pressure, and meaning that magmatic outgassing throughout Earth history has partially influenced the composition of our atmosphere.  Third, this research will explore the stability of these minerals in the presence oxidized fluids.  Monazite, for instance, is a major host of light rare earth elements, thorium, and uranium in the crust. Understanding the stability and solubility of this mineral will also help researchers explore the mobility of these key heat producing and economically important elements (rare earth elements are found in almost all modern electronics manufactured today). And finally, minerals (zircons) older than 4 billion years represent a key target for application because rocks from this time period are either sparse or altogether absent. This work will therefore result in new knowledge about the environments and conditions that may have prevailed on the earliest Earth.  <br/>	<br/>Oxygen fugacity buffered experiments will be conducted in piston cylinder devices at the University of Rochester.  In many cases, experimental products will be analyzed by a Laser Ablation Inductively Couple Plasma Mass Spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS; also at the University of Rochester) by the PI, graduate, and undergraduate students.  This will provide key training for undergraduates and graduate students in techniques involved in mineral synthesis and mass spectrometry, with applications that extend well beyond the geology/mineralogy field.  (LA)-IPC-MS instruments have been used in medical research, biology, chemistry, and materials science, so students will come away with a useful skill set applicable across the STEM fields.  In addition, students will receive training in X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) techniques; this work will be undertaken at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.  The practical training will result in a broad skill set, highly applicable to many areas within and outside the geosciences.  The broader impacts of this project come from several activities that implement active learning.  This award will enable a partnership with NSF-Funded Noyce program awarded to the Warner School of Education at the University of Rochester.  The PI will work with selected K-12 math and science teacher fellows in high-need urban districts in upstate New York - current graduate rates are below 50% - to increase science literacy, to create a better understanding of the different manners in which people learn, to expose teachers to new and evolving methods of teaching, and to create learning experiences that are more interesting, meaningful, and effective for their students.  And finally, the PI will design a new course to explore teaching strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective when compared to a traditional lecture.

Conley of the University of California, Riverside is researching methods to realize this long-standing challenge. A key to solving this problem is a better understanding of the chemical interactions between the solid surface and these catalytically-reactive sites. Dr. Conley is involved in outreach activities related to this research to promote the engagement of underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Dr. Conley is hosting students from local high schools and community colleges in his laboratory for summer internships to introduce them to the university research environment, which encourages them to enter STEM career paths. <br/><br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Matthew P. Conley of the University of California, Riverside is researching new material platforms to generate well-defined heterogeneous catalysts. This work focuses on the reaction of phosphines (R3P) with Brnsted acidic oxides, such as sulfated zirconium oxide, to generate well-defined phosphonium sites on the oxide surface. The substituents in R3P impact how strongly the phosphine binds to the sulfated zirconium oxide surface, which relates to the Brnsted acidity of surface sites on this material. The phosphonium sites react with organometallic complexes to form well-defined catalytic sites that polymerize or oligomerize ethylene, depending on the nature of the organometallic complex in the grafting reaction and the substituents on the phosphonium site. The above reactions are monitored using spectroscopic techniques, such as Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) and solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Dr. Conley is involved in promoting STEM fields though outreach activities by bringing underrepresented minority students into the lab, in support of the broader impacts of this project. Funding from this Chemical Catalysis program enables Dr. Conley to provide summer internships to local high school students and local community college students from institutions serving predominately Hispanic populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This meeting promotes the advancement of science by tackling an understudied dimension of plant systems - time. To survive, plants must adapt to an ever-changing environment in real-time, often maintaining those responses over a prolonged time, yet current studies typically capture only a snapshot of a response. This conference will highlight new methods and approaches to track and analyze dynamic plant responses in real time, at different time-scales and at different levels of inquiry. It brings together world experts in this emerging field, from a variety of disciplines that include cell biology, development, physiology, genomics, environmental biology and evolutionary biology, and puts them in a small setting with young scientists to nucleate a new subdiscipline of plant biology, Dynamic Plant Systems. Understanding these dynamics has practical implications for national health, prosperity and welfare, and talks will address how new approaches are able to capture real-time plant responses that have economic importance. One example is a system developed to allow real-time tracking of complex changes in root architecture, gene expression, and microbial associations that both model and crop plant species have to changes in their environment. Another example captures how the coordinate actions of light-signaling pathways and the circadian clock enhance plant performance in natural environments. The scientifically diverse slate of speakers is also diverse ethnically and with respect to gender, and the organizers will have an outreach consultant focusing on social media and underrepresented demographics to broaden participation in this exciting new area.<br/><br/>As dynamics affects all parts of plant biology, the meeting will keep a breadth across topics in plant biology, but with a unique focus on time across scales of inquiry. These span a keynote which presents advances in genomics, epigenomics and proteomics, coupled to novel modeling and statistical approaches, including time-based studies that beginning to reveal previously unknown gene-network interactions at a variety of levels that could not be identified using more conventional means. Other time- based studies will reveal new experimental methods to capture these cellular network connections in 3D at high resolution, as well as methods to analyze and visualize these cell-cell networks over time. In addition, presentations will introduce how light sheet microscopy has uncovered a time-based, clock-like process responsible for the positioning of lateral roots along the root primary axis. An important part of attracting scientists to a new field of study is supporting career development, and the meeting will include several activities including a Power Hour intended to support the professional growth of young scientists, especially women in our scientific communities and provide an open forum for discussion and mentoring. An associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will take place over the course of two-days leading up to the start of the conference. The GRS is a unique forum for graduate students, post- docs to present and exchange new data and cutting-edge ideas. One discussion section will focus on the transition from graduate and post-doc studies to further careers in science, hosted by an early career Assistant Professor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The causes of the ETE are still under investigation, but massive volcanic eruptions during the breakup of Pangea emitted large amounts of greenhouse gases, which in turn caused habitat-change.  As a result, many animal and plant species went extinct, allowing for new animals to thrive, notably dinosaurs. The project focuses on two field locations: the Moenave Formation of Utah, near the sub-tropics during the time of extinction, and the Elliot Formation of South Africa and Lesotho, near the South Pole. By combining the timescale with the occurrence of fossils, a prediction of how major climatic changes may cause extinction will be developed, thus providing us with clues about how to mitigate the current increased levels of species extinctions. The proposed study has important societal implications.  It addresses some of the grand challenges for research on Earth-surface processes, published by the National Academy of Sciences (Landscapes on the Edge: New Horizons for Research on Earth's Surface).  For example, the research will help identify how knowledge of our planet's past helps us prepare for a sustainable future. Students supported by this project will be recruited from two major organizations that encourage scientific education for minorities:  the Society for Chicanos and Native Americans in Science and the National Association of Black Geoscientists. The project will involve federal agencies through partnerships with the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Museum and Zion National Park, specifically via museum and visitor center displays of our study outcomes. Student exchange experience will be coordinated with Senior Personnel at the University of Cape Town (UCT) and University of the Witwatersrand (UW).  Students from the University of Arkansas (UA) will spend a field season in southern Africa learning field skills and gaining cultural experiences, and students from UCT and UW will visit the UA to learn geochemical and spectrometry skills and visit field sites. Finally, we will develop datasets for and work with high school teachers that are training for the Next Generation Science Standards adopted by the state of Arkansas.<br/><br/>The project will: 1) identify the ETE in the Moenave Formation, USA (low-latitude) and the Elliot Formation of southern Africa (high-latitude) using bio- and chemostratigraphy and high resolution geochronology; 2) generate paleoclimate proxy data; 3) determine biostratigraphic trends in ichnological and microfaunal record; and 4) compare ecosystem and climatic shifts in high versus low-latitudes in the southern hemisphere. The methods employed include: 1) collection of C-isotope (bulk and compound-specific) chemostratigraphic and detrital zircon geochronologic data from both formations; and 2) biostratigraphic data (body and trace fossils of vertebrates and invertebrates). CO2 concentration, temperature, and mean annual precipitation will be calculated using stable and clumped isotopes from paleosol and lacustrine sediments, major and minor element concentrations from paleosols, and O-isotopes from ostracods and vertebrate fossils. These data will then be correlated to the paleontological occurrences of vertebrate and invertebrate remains from both continents to determine effects of climate change caused by the CAMP on the two ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional deep learning algorithms rely on powerful computers tethered to the cloud which incurs a large communication overhead, requires extensive computing resources, and compromises privacy and security. There is a strong consensus among experts that the next frontier in deep learning will be highly-efficient neural network processors running on mobile platforms. This project aims at developing a compact and low power alternative to conventional deep learning computing hardware, specifically targeted for edge devices. The proposed approach is based on a novel computing concept called time-based circuits, which can deliver a similar level of inference performance at only a fraction of the power consumption compared to traditional methods. Throughout the project, the investigators will consider transferring the new neural network computing methods to industry. The new time-based deep learning computation methods will be incorporated into the graduate and undergraduate curricula, as well as K-12 outreach activities, of the electrical engineering and computer science departments at the University of Minnesota.<br/><br/>This project will focus on both hardware and software techniques for enabling deep learning applications on resource-constrained mobile platforms. On the hardware side, the team will demonstrate a prototype low-power deep neural network processor where internal operations such as convolution, pooling, and activation functions are performed entirely in the time domain. On the software side, the team will develop pruning, approximation, and hybrid approaches that can effectively reduce the complexity of deep neural networks with minimal impact on the overall inference accuracy.

This theoretical and empirical work will establish basic facts about how demand and training conditions shape early STEM career choices that can be determine only through the integration of separate datasets. The project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>The research design integrates three approaches - peer-based, network-based, and demand. In their peer-based approach, the researchers propose to take the composition of peers in entering graduate cohorts to be quasi-random and estimate how the composition of peers interacts with their own characteristics. A second set of analyses involves identifying labs from the data and estimating how the composition of the persons in a lab relate to outcomes. The network-based approach will be used to examine how individual differences in social capital shape doctoral student outcomes. The demand will answer the analytical question of the effect of actual and perceived labor market demand on the choice of careers. The analysis will begin with a description of the early career outcomes of students from undergraduate dropouts to college graduates, from master's students to Ph.D. dropouts to doctoral recipients.

The second objective is to identify research priority areas and discuss possible mechanisms for joint, international cooperation on research and education activities in ecology and infectious disease research. This is important since infectious diseases do not recognize international borders. The emergence and re-emergence of human, animal and plant infectious diseases around the world have been a major concern for various economic sectors (e.g., crop production, livestock production, forestry), biodiversity, and public health and security. Broader impacts from the workshop include publishing a paper on the current status, gaps, and research priorities in ecology and evolution of infectious diseases, training opportunities for US faculty and students, and network building opportunities for researchers and institutions from the US.<br/><br/>A number of large-scale epidemics of infection diseases (e.g., H5N1, H7N9, Ebola and Zika) in the past two decades have resulted in substantial losses of human life, as well as in increased economic burdens.

The key problem is that decentralized applications are executed by mutually distrusting entities in a decentralized distributed system (such as a blockchain), where the entities must collaborate to execute the desired computation, despite not trusting each other.  Building decentralized applications is difficult and error prone because the low-level security mechanisms are too removed from the high-level policies, thus it is difficult for programmers to correctly implement the policies. In these cases, no single entity is trusted to fully specify or enforce security policies. The project will develop Flame, a programming language offering more precise abstractions for expressing security intent in decentralized systems. Using Flame gives developers assurance that their programs are both secure and realizable without requiring them to design and implement complex security protocols.  This project will also develop Decent, a decentralized runtime platform for executing decentralized applications built with Flame. The project will open-source Flame and Decent and promote them with publications, tutorials, and course materials. <br/><br/>To explore a new, integrated approach to enforce end-to-end security for decentralized applications the project will build a prototype based on techniques for decentralized information flow control, blockchain networks, trusted computing, and cryptography to create a high-level programming layer that eases the task of building, verifying, and deploying decentralized applications.  The prototype will support policies that cannot be enforced in current information control models and are too difficult to realize with cryptographic and access control mechanisms alone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geophysical data (bathymetric and seismic) from passive continental margins document that these failures range from thin (less than 1 m) to thick (greater than 100 m) units, may have moved 100s of km, and can behave like a fluid or a solid. These analyses combined with numerical models of submarine slope failures suggest the failures are triggered when shallowly buried sediments are perturbed by an external stress such as a change in fluid pressure or earthquake-related shaking. Existing borehole samples and geophysical data provide a snapshot of what the materials look like after failure and numerical models provide predictions of how failures started, yet there is a lack of direct observations of the failure process which affects the final deposits. This project will characterize failure deposits offshore North Carolina using existing data from the North American Margin Community Seismic Experiment. A scaled, physical model with a novel triggering mechanism will be built to create and visualize failure dynamics. The project will advance process-based modeling techniques to incorporate how initial conditions, initiation mechanism, and failure behavior are linked. As part of the broader impacts a graduate student will be trained across multiple disciplines (seismology, sedimentology, geomechanics and engineering) as part of this project. Overall, the project will contribute to society by improving risk assessment for slope failures and tsunami generation along the US coastline. <br/><br/>This project will integrate existing field data from the GeoPRISMS-funded Eastern North American Margin Community Seismic Experiment with laboratory and numerical models allowing for a process-based analysis of slope failures that links failure type and dynamics to initial conditions and driving mechanisms including earthquake shaking and fluid pressure changes. Laboratory experiments will provide a control on initial conditions (sediment type and properties), fluid pressures (magnitudes and distribution), and earthquake sources (location and energy) while initiating slope failures and observing failure dynamics. Numerical models will simulate the processes observed in nature and provide a means to link lab-scale experiments with field-scale observations. The project will address the following hypotheses: 1) differences between seismic velocity profiles within submarine slope failure deposits and adjacent, unfailed deposits record different effective stress and strength profiles; 2) effective stress and strength of sediments at the onset of failure impact the slope failure type and mobilization behavior of failed submarine sediments; and 3) slope failure trigger mechanism impacts slope failure dynamics and evolution, which influences their tsunami-generating potential. The overall project objective is to describe and characterize links between failure type, deposits, initial conditions, and driving mechanisms, which will increase the ability to use slope failure deposits in the sedimentary record to evaluate driving mechanisms. This will improve our ability to understand the history and distribution of slope failures and their tsunami potential. The project will also provide constraints on conditions that may produce large tsunami, which can inform risk assessment for slope failure and associated tsunami hazard.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, our best hope for confronting the many problems this new environment has brought to humanity (privacy and fairness, to mention only two) also lies in new computer science research. Research in theoretical computer science in particular over the past half century has been instrumental in bringing the benefits of Moore's law to bear through fundamental clever algorithms and has made leaps in understanding the capabilities and limitations of computers and their software. In fact, it has articulated one of the most important problems in mathematics and all of science today: is P equal to NP? i.e, is exponential exhaustive search for a solution always avoidable?  The two investigators on this award have over the past four decades contributed much to this edifice of mathematical research in computer science, often in close collaboration. In this project, these investigators will work together in order to attack a new generation of problems: complexity questions in the fringe of the P vs. NP problem, a new genre of algorithms possessing a novel kind of robustness, research at the interface between computer science and economics related to income inequality and market efficiency, as well as research aiming at a better understanding of evolution, and of brain functions as basic as memory and as advanced as language.  The project will train PhD and Masters students and possibly undergraduates as well on these research topics. The findings of this research will be disseminated to students and researchers, both in computer science and in other disciplines, as well as to the general public, through journal and conference publications, undergraduate and graduate courses, seminars, colloquia, as well as public talks and general interest articles.<br/><br/>The project will work on improving our understanding of the complexity of total functions in the class TFNP and its subclasses, in view of recent research progress in that area. On complexity side, the project will: (1) investigate the complexity of an as yet unexplored, from this point of view, Tarski-like fixed-point theorem widely used in economics (2) revisit the approximability of the traveling salesperson problem and (3) explore a new kind of algorithmic notion of robustness based on dense nets of algorithms.  In algorithmic game theory, the project will: (1) explore a new variant of the price of anarchy inspired by wealth inequality, as well as the complexity of market equilibria in markets with production and economies of scale (2) research a new game theoretic solution concept based on the topology of dynamical systems (3) pursue the proof of an intriguing new complexity-theoretic conjecture about the inaccessibility of Nash equilibria.  The work will also explore certain promising directions at the interface of game theory and learning theory.  In the life sciences, the project will explore from the algorithmic point of view the problem of the true nature of mutations, and will extend recent research aiming at the computational understanding of how long-term memory, as well as syntax and language, are achieved in the human brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although electronic implants that replace natural stimulation of muscles and nerves, such as the cardiac pacemaker and vagus nerve stimulator, offer a unique means for treating certain diseases for which no other effective therapy exists, many of their complications, such as harmful immune responses and unsustainable power requirements, preclude the development of a lifetime solution. To radically resolve the debilitating issues associated with these electronic neural implants, this CAREER project proposes a new neural implant technology using the patient's own cells. As a proof of concept, this project will create an entirely new type of circuit design, called a multicellular biological neural pacemaker (BNP).  The BNP will use cardiomyocytes, the muscle cells that control the beating properties of the heart, as the power source and signal generator.  The ""generator"" will stimulate motor neurons, which in turn can excite muscle cells. The core problem of this design is obtaining synchronized rhythmic activity between the motor neurons and the cardiomyocytes.  To establish feasibility, this ""wiring"" problem will be addressed by genetically engineering functional channels, called gap junctions, between the cell types while they are cultured together.  If successful, this transformative technology can be extended broadly to applications ranging from the development of a biological heart pacemaker, to treatment for Parkinson's disease, and to muscle stimulation.  Complementary to the research goal, this project will carry out a diversified series of educational activities, including building a competitive interdisciplinary research team, organizing a campuswide Neuroengineering Journal Club and a Neurotechnology Seminar Series, and organizing an annual symposium on biocircuits at the Materials Research Society Spring Meetings.<br/><br/>As part of the long-term career goal to establish a research program on the science and engineering of autologous neural implant technology toward the ultimate substitution for electronic neural implants, the focus of this project is to prove this concept through an example biocircuit design of multicellular biological neural pacemaker (BNP). The feasibility for such a design will be investigated using an in vitro coculture system designed to validate the hypothesis that motor neurons can be electrically synchronized to cardiomyocytes via genetically engineered gap junctions. Specifically, this project will: (1) study how cardiomyocytes and motor neurons adapt to a coculture; (2) form functional gap junctions among motor neurons and cardiomyocytes using lentiviral transduction; and (3) recapitulate the results with hiPSC-derived motor neurons and cardiomyocytes. This work will lay the foundation for building this multicellular BNP. Here, in vitro demonstration of intercellular functional wiring for the design of the BNP as an example living implant suggests the possible application of autologous neural implants for medical treatment. Furthermore, this approach of engineering cellular inputs/outputs (I/Os) for wiring atypical heterogeneous biocircuits will spark great interests in the scientific community for cellular I/O engineering and development of application-specific integrated biocircuits. With synthetic cells and specifically designed intercellular I/Os, it will be possible to build, from bottom up, more complex heterogeneous biocircuits of advanced functionalities, thus greatly expanding the engineering capability of biology for a variety of exciting applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, natural materials, such as rocks and environmental samples, prove to be the most difficult to analyze as they are complex mixtures of every element in the periodic table.  The most distinguishing characteristic of any element is its mass and isotopic composition.  This gave rise to the invention of the mass spectrometer in the 1920's and to the gradual expansion of the capabilities of this type of instrument so that now a vast array of different types of mass spectrometers constitute the most widely used instrument whenever chemical, and particularly isotope, analyses are needed.  The sensitivity of the mass spectrometer depends on how efficiently the element(s) to be analyzed can be turned into electrically charged ions, termed ionization efficiency.  This project will build on basic instrumentation developments done at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to extend and expand the use of a cavity ion source for chemical and isotopic measurements applied to the geosciences.  The cavity ion source consists of a narrow (1 mm diameter) tube into which the sample is placed.  The cavity is then heated to extreme temperatures (up to 3000 C) causing the sample to evaporate.  Individual sample atoms repeatedly bounce against the walls of the cavity on their way to the cavity opening.  Whenever an atom touches the hot metal surface of the cavity, it has a finite probability of becoming ionized.  Once it does, the electric field applied at the opening of the cavity extracts the ion and accelerates it into the mass spectrometer.  Cavity ion sources have demonstrated ionization efficiencies 10-50 times greater than that of the conventional instruments, known as thermal ionization mass spectrometers.  The improvement in ionization efficiency in cavity ion sources will allow analyses to be extended to sample sizes 10-50 times smaller that currently possible, or allow the isotopic composition of large samples to be analyzed to much higher precision.  This projects application of the enhanced sensitivity of the cavity ion source will focus on study of the processes and timescales by which the solid Earth formed, and how and when it separated into core, mantle, and crust leading to the habitable environments and concentrating the resources that allow life to survive and prosper on Earth.<br/><br/>This grant will allow development of a simplified cavity thermal ion source that will dramatically improve the sensitivity of a type of mass spectrometer widely used for geoscience studies.  Thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) has been a critical tool in geosciences for almost a century, on a wide range of topics that depend on radioactive chronology, isotope tracing, and high-sensitivity chemical analyses. Cavity thermal ion sources, like those used in nuclear laboratories, can offer up to a factor of 10-50 increase in ionization efficiency over conventional TIMS for a variety elements that are useful in the geosciences (e.g., Cr, Sr, Nd, Pb).  Sensitivity improvements of this magnitude translate to similar magnitude reductions in sample size to make isotopic measurements at current levels of precision, or alternatively allow much higher precision isotope ratio analyses for sample sizes similar to those used currently.  The goal of the project is to design a cavity ion source that can be readily adapted to the type of commercial TIMS commonly used in the geosciences to provide greatly enhanced ionization efficiencies while retaining the simplicity, cleanliness, and ease of use of the modern TIMS instrument.  Isotope ratio measurements address many first order questions in the geosciences, from providing the basis for radiometric geochronology, to tracing of many of the main chemical processes that act to modify Earth's surface and interior.  An ion source that can offer factors of 10 or more increased sensitivity over existing sources, but retains the simplicity, ease of use, and cleanliness of existing instruments would find rapid adoption by the geoscience community and the commercial instrument manufacturers that serve that community. The project also will involve the training of an early career scientist who will learn not only which buttons on the computer to push to tell the instrument to produce data, but the basic physics of the mass spectrometer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But design limitations and lack of interaction principles have limited their adoption for indoor uses.  The goal of this research is to discover broad interaction principles for communicative sUAV flight paths in various spaces and with diverse users, so that when design limitations such as indoor navigation and battery life are solved the drones will be capable of safe, efficient, and informative interactions with people.  To this end, the first challenge will be to identify key communication failures, or barriers between humans and robots, which can create unsafe and inefficient interactions, and to define strategies for avoiding these problems.  Guidelines will be developed for gestural communication from a vehicle to a user in order to generate safer and more natural interactions, while respecting personal space requirements.   The two central hypotheses underlying this research are that gestural communication will allow better visibility of robot state or knowledge to bystanders while being applicable to existing platforms without modifications, and that interaction distances will need to adapt to the design of the vehicle, the user, and the environment to maintain comfort and efficiency in interactions.  This work will have broad impacts both on education and on society through directed activities to improve understanding of human-robot interaction.  Education will be supported through activities such as lesson plans for K-12 students, integration of the research into an undergraduate human-computer interaction class, and informing a semester-long course for both undergraduate and graduate students on human-robot interaction (HRI).  Additional outreach efforts will include a month-long interaction with 6-8th grade students from local Title 1 schools teaching K-5 students about the scientific method, and an evening class for adults to inform them about current robotics and HRI research.  The PI will continue her ongoing efforts to broaden participation in computer science research. <br/> <br/>This research will encompass three parallel objectives related to gestural communications by sUAVs and comfortable distancing.  Objective 1 will focus on communicative motions of state information from the vehicle; gestures will be generated through participatory design and tested using methods from the social sciences.  Objective 2 will also be informed by methods from the social sciences, but will focus on distancing with sUAVs and will take advantage of an existing room in the PI's lab with movable walls, video cameras, and a motion capture system.  Each of these two research objectives could be carried out in the absence of progress from the other; however, their exploration together is natural since the gestures are conveyed by different vehicles, scaled to spaces, and the robots perform tasks which may require human involvement.  This combined investigation will comprise Objective 3, which will focus on efficient signaling, incorporating the distancing work into the flight paths, and reception with users performing a variety of tasks.   Project outcomes will transform close-proximity HRI by enabling sUAVs to generate communicative flight paths that are optimized based on likelihood of receipt and comfort in highly independent human-robot teams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The underlying assumption is that WBL might serve as an antidote to negative social and cultural messages, lack of support, lack of access to on-the-job STEM learning, and other factors that influence students' decisions to remain in STEM. The study also will contribute to career counseling research through the application of the SCCT in the community college context. <br/><br/>Researchers will use a mixed-methods research design that involves an analysis of two cohorts (recession and post-recession) using data from the Florida Education Data System (FEDS), case studies at two Florida community colleges, and transcript data for the information technology and engineering technology students enrolled at the case study schools. The study sample is expected to include a total of 8,665 community college students with 1,500 having participated in a WBL course.  Researchers will use exploratory and descriptive multivariate analysis of FEDS to answer questions about WBL participation and impact.  Case studies of WBL will be conducted at two Florida community colleges to collect data about how students learn about WBL, what influences their choice to participate in WBL, how WBL influences their self-efficacy and expectations (per SCCT), and perceptions of whether WBL improves student outcomes. In addition, they will analyze extant data from the colleges to explore the impact of WBL experiences on student completion and entrance into STEM careers and four-year STEM programs of study.  The interview sample for both colleges will include 60 students, six administrators, 24 faculty, and 48 employers.

Early cloud platforms were simple, requiring users to choose from a small number of servers ""on-demand"" for a fixed per-hour price. However, modern cloud platforms are evolving into full-fledged markets that offer servers under a range of complex contracts that expose applications to different forms of risk, such as the risk of price increases, server revocations, or server shortages.  By offering such contracts, cloud platforms can increase their infrastructure's utilization, revenue, and energy-efficiency, while cloud users can lower their costs by tailoring their contracts to match their applications' requirements.  Unfortunately, given the complexity of cloud contracts and the relationship between risk, application correctness, and performance, developing risk-aware applications represents a significant challenge. To address the challenge, this project will explore the feasibility of system support for managing risk in cloud markets by adapting and extending concepts from economics and finance. A key goal of the project is to elevate risk management to a first-class systems design principle. <br/><br/>The project includes multiple broader impacts. By enabling better risk management, cloud platforms can significantly increase their utilization and energy-efficiency, while also lowering users' costs. The project will incorporate modules on cloud economics and managing risk in cloud platforms into undergraduate and graduate seminars, which will relate it to core concepts in operating systems, networking, and distributed systems. The researchers also plan to integrate cloud economics topics from the project into seminars on cloud computing for aspiring college students they regularly give.

This project will examine the inter-relations between oral vocabulary, reading, mathematics, and science difficulties throughout the elementary grades, yielding greater scientific knowledge about the early onset and over-time dynamics of these types of learning difficulties. Doing so should help identify the cognitive, behavioral, affective, and social conditions that collectively interfere with STEM learning including early in children's school careers. These analyses should also inform the delivery and design of STEM interventions at time periods when such interventions may be the most effective.<br/><br/>This project will analyze two nationally representative and longitudinal datasets (i.e., the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort and Kindergarten Cohort of 2011, or ECLS-B and ECLS-K:2011) to investigate risk factors for oral vocabulary difficulties prior to or by kindergarten. The team will also examine to what extent oral vocabulary and reading difficulties during kindergarten and 1st grade increase children's risk of experiencing mathematics and science difficulties in later grades. To best address the project's research aims, a range of advanced analytical methods will be used including multilevel modeling, latent growth and growth mixture modeling, and structural equation modeling with random and fixed effects. <br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of these challenges is macromolecular crowding that can derail even robust biological pathways. This situation becomes critical when considering proteins with energetic folding landscapes that permit many conformational states. In these cases, the environment can clearly influence the conformation by favoring one pathway over another. Such decisions can have long-lasting biological consequences, as is the case for prions, proteins with the ability to exist stably in distinct functional states with divergent structures: one soluble, the other a highly ordered, self-templating aggregate. Because the aggregating proteins have identical sequences, differences in cellular environment are responsible for the conformational switch. Despite the importance of the environment for protein folding, structural investigations of biomolecules are typically confined to in vitro systems, which cannot capture important structural features imposed by biological environments. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy (ssNMR) is currently undergoing a 'sensitivity renaissance' with the development of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This method has a theoretical maximum sensitivity enhancement of 660-fold; thus an experiment that would require decades of experimental time with traditional ssNMR methods can be collected in a day with DNP NMR. This project will advance our knowledge about protein structure in natural biological contexts. The PI will develop training videos for undergraduate and high school students in collaboration with high school teachers.  These training videos will then be distributed nationally through the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.<br/><br/>Structural investigations of biomolecules are typically confined to in vitro systems under extremely limited conditions. These investigations yield invaluable insights, but such experiments cannot capture important structural features imposed by cellular environments. Structural studies of proteins in their native contexts are not only possible using state-of-the-art sensitivity-enhanced (dynamic nuclear polarization or DNP) solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, but also that the native context can have a dramatic influence on protein structure. This project will 1) visualize such structural changes with atomic level resolution and 2) provide an understanding of how genetic background can influence protein folding. To do so, the PI will use novel sample preparation for NMR to investigate the structure of a protein containing both an environmentally sensitive folding pathway and an intrinsically disordered region. Using a self-polymerizing yeast prion protein, Sup35, this project will investigate how native and mutant cellular environments affect amyloid structure. While the methodology developed in this project can be easily applied to systems of interest such as the protein mis-folding in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's it can likewise be applied to emerging basic problems such as the structural basis of phase separated biological condensates. The work will build the foundation of a new field of in vivo structural biology directly informed by genetic backgrounds, environmental perturbation and cellular phenotypes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knowledge exists regarding PD for in-service teachers, communities of practice, principles for broadening participation, and RPPs, but there are plenty of opportunities to expand experience and expertise in these areas in combination with each other.  The proposed RPP for Iowa includes university personnel to supply content, curriculum design experts and researchers, Iowa Area Education Agenices (AEA) personnel for localization and ongoing support, and school districts with knowledge practitioners. It is an ideal partnership to design and test a network for providing computer science PD and ongoing support. <br/><br/>The partnership will start by piloting a PD network for high school CS teachers in one of nine AEAs in Iowa.  Identified in-service teachers will complete three courses over two summers and the intervening school year: an introduction to programming, a CS methods course, and a big ideas course.  Instruction will be designed using the Iowa Professional Development Model.  During the PD, participants will become familiar with engagement practices and the culturally responsive computing practices through modelling and explicit instruction.  Furthermore, district personnel in the participants' school districts will attend a workshop on understanding biases and broadening participation in order to set a more positive school environment.  Upon completion of the PD, participants will be well-prepared to teach a high-quality introduction to programming course or an AP CS Principles course.  The proposers have already recruited four districts for inclusion in the partnership and expect to increase that number to 20 over the course of the award.

Examples of these include dental plaque, the slime that forms on ship hulls, and wound-associated infections. Biofilms contain millions of microscopic cells, and the individual locations of these cells affect their ability to function. For example, the location of cells within a wound-associated biofilm affects their ability to resist antibiotics. To understand how cell location affects function, their locations must be controlled in three dimensions; however, because the microorganisms within a biofilm are microscopically small, they are difficult to manipulate at a single cell level. This CAREER award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Montana State University, Bozeman, supports the investigation of biofilm structure and function by building biofilms from microscopic modules that can be assembled, disassembled, and analyzed in a controlled manner. This approach will enable researchers to synthetically construct multi-species biofilms in the laboratory to understand how bugs communicate, cooperate, or compete. The proposed work will benefit society as a whole by uncovering the physical mechanisms behind microbial virulence and antibiotic resistance. This understanding can lead to new methods that will aid in controlling these persistent, surface-associated microbial colonies. Impact in the state of Montana will be provided by a ""Soft Materials Shop"" (SMASH), which will be used for both outreach and teaching, and will strengthen the connection of sciences, engineering, architecture, and art on campus.  This space will be the first in the state of Montana and will be accessible to the public. This proposal will help prepare Montana students for future careers in STEM using inquiry-based learning strategies and hands-on demos, educate the public about microfabrication and engineering, and provide opportunities for outreach that will engage public audiences from youth to adults. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Biofilms are ubiquitous in the natural world, are formed by nearly all microorganisms, including algae, bacteria, archaea, and can be both beneficial and harmful. The spatial locations of microbes in a biofilm impact biofilm function and physiology; however, methods for structuring biofilms in three dimensions are currently lacking. The ability to synthetically construct a heterogeneous, multi-species biofilm by placing microorganisms in discrete locations within a cultivated environment would allow researchers to bridge this gap and explore how bugs communicate, cooperate, or compete. To achieve this, colloidal engineering techniques will be applied to place microbes in spatially organized three-dimensional locations to understand how spatial heterogeneity influences structure-function relationships in biofilms. The aims of this proposal are to create monodisperse capsules of gels and shells to encapsulate microbes, to assemble capsules into three-dimensional structures, and finally to create modular synthetic consortia of bacteria to explore questions related to heterogeneity in biofilms. These constructs will be used to understand how biofilm behavior such as quorum sensing, matrix formation, and dormancy arises from heterogeneity in biofilms. This CAREER award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Montana State University, Bozeman, will support the integration of soft matter science into classes, workshops, demonstrations, and tours within a dedicated space called ""SMASH"", the creation of K-8 after-school outreach modules, and an undergraduate/graduate course on ""Soft Matter Engineering"". This award will allow for creative, multidisciplinary collaboration, bringing together students in art, architecture, engineering, and science on campus to create, prototype, design, and build. The ideas, workshops, and demonstrations created in this space will be incorporated into current K-8 outreach efforts and extended to future outreach efforts to introduce soft matter science, a relatively young area of research, to students and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With its fast growth in volume, it becomes critical to process semi-structured data on parallel processors, which have become ubiquitous and increasingly powerful. However, data-parallel processing of semi-structured data remains a fundamental challenge, due to its inherent nested structure. A partitioning of semi-structured data can easily break the well-formed nature of nested levels, making the data hard to process. To address the challenge, this research proposes to examine the basic computation models used for processing semi-structured data -- pushdown transducers, and designs a transducer-centric parallelization paradigm. This enables automatic generation of data-parallel processing routines for software applications that consume semi-structured data. Because of the fundamental role of semi-structured data, the insights gained from this research will facilitate research advancement beyond program parallelization.<br/><br/>Transducer-centric parallelization consists of four components. The first component examines inherent dependences in pushdown transducer executions and designs a series of basic mechanisms to break them by leveraging their special properties, such as 'finite-state' and 'bounded stack access'. The second and third components focus on improving the parallelization efficiency either by exploiting the transition structures of pushdown transducers and the grammars of semi-structured data, or by adopting an aggressive speculative execution scheme. The last component of this research develops algorithms and software tools to automatically generate parallel pushdown transducers for commonly used processing routines of semi-structured data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Internal tides can constitute a dominant energy source on continental shelves, where they can lead to processes such as soliton generation, turbulent mixing and cross shelf exchange, with wide ranging implications for transport, biological productivity and near-shore pollution. This study will explore how internal tides are transformed near the shelf break to propagate along the coast and how quickly they decay by radiating some of their energy offshore.<br/><br/><br/>In the deep ocean internal tides usually manifest as low vertical mode waves, however, close to the continental shelf break they may take the form of ""leaky"" (superinertial) baroclinic coastal trapped waves and edge waves. These modal structures are superinertial analogues to the well studied subinertial coastal trapped waves, having a component that radiates along the shelf break. However, they are distinguished from subinertial waves by exhibiting coincident radiation offshore (i.e. ""leaking""). The goal of this study is to better understand the nature of internal tides close to the coastal margin, where the presence of leaky baroclinic trapped internal tides may contribute to the along shore variability and propagation of tidal energy. The study will consider the forcing of these waves by both the local astronomical tide, and by remotely incident deep ocean internal tides. The approach will include idealized, linear, two-dimensional (cross-shore) analyses; idealized, three-dimensional, nonlinear numerical simulations of the coastal response to local and remote forcing; and a suite of realistic numerical simulations to investigate leaky trapped internal tide energy along the U.

Offspring inherit copies of the chromosomes bearing the original or the inverted sequence. In some natural populations, inverted chromosomes can become abundantly distributed. This suggests that they may confer an advantage to the organism that has them. This research will provide the first experimental test of an important hypothesis that would explain why these DNA reversals can proliferate.  Inversions often have large effects and are common in many species, including humans. Understanding their persistence and spread is important to basic research and applied research including medicine and agriculture. This project will also support the development of online tools to help teach basic genetics and evolution principles at the high school level.<br/><br/>A decade ago, the Kirkpatrick-Barton mathematical model was proposed to explain how natural selection would allow new inversions to spread in natural populations.

The researchers will use genome editing tools to experimentally create an inversion that captures alleles known to be associated with adaptations to particular environments. The researchers will monitor the pace with which the chromosomal inversion spreads in replicated experimental populations and compare this pace to detailed model predictions.

People vary in their willingness to trust others, to cooperate across group boundaries, and how they enforce pro-social behaviors in their communities.  These cultural differences have major implications for important social outcomes, from individual well-being to the economic prosperity of nations.  To develop policies that promote beneficial social outcomes, it is important to understand the mechanisms that drive such differences.  This project addresses this challenge by focusing on the nature of social environments, or social ecologies, that vary from culture to culture.  One way in which social ecologies vary is in relational mobility, which refers to the opportunities people have to voluntarily enter into and exit from social relationships.  Variations in relational mobility are expected to have predictable and important influences on behavior and cognition, helping to account for differences in social behaviors often observed across cultures.  By understanding the origin of such cultural differences, societies will be better informed to promote positive and beneficial policies and to reduce harmful and counterproductive social behaviors.<br/><br/>The research component of this project has two major parts: The first examines patterns of social interactions in a large-scale study of daily social interactions across cultures. The goal is to determine the extent to which patterns of relational mobility and social interactions coincide with historical and environmental factors, and lead to psychological and behavioral outcomes. The second part of the research component uses experimental approaches to examine whether changes in relational mobility can lead to changes in social behavior within and across cultures.  The goal is to uncover the mechanisms by which social ecological factors impact individual behavior.  The project also includes an educational component, providing international research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in the United States, and helping to establish long-lasting collaborative networks for the next generation of scientists.  Contributions of the research and educational components of the project will promote the integration of international and interdisciplinary perspectives, and provide opportunities for social impact by developing tools to promote socially beneficial behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project has the potential to increase the diversity of the civil engineering workforce and may bring new perspectives to the civil engineering process itself. It also has the potential to produce new insights into the impacts that changes to pedagogy and course sequencing have on student performance, self-efficacy, and persistence.<br/><br/>The goal of this S-STEM Track 2 project is to encourage persistence of diverse, high-achieving, low-income students in civil engineering. Project objectives include attaining 85% persistence in civil engineering and 75% persistence within the two S-STEM cohorts. Each cohort of ten students will form a student academic community of practice. Cohort members will be scheduled in the same courses, assigned to common dormitories, and participate together in co-curricular seminars. Prior to their first and second years, students will live on campus and complete Calculus I and Calculus II in sections restricted to S-STEM students. During their second year of study, students will complete Chemistry I and II in small, active-learning sections. Professional mentorship, research, and internship opportunities will be provided to enhance students' self-efficacy. The project aims to study the impacts of the interventions on student self-efficacy, retention, and performance using validated instruments and follow-up focus groups and interviews. The project has the potential to develop theoretically grounded and empirically verified best practices for retention of low-income, high-performing engineering students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main challenge in developing algorithmic solutions for these systems lies in the fact that only feedback for the recommended options, but not the other ones, is provided by the users. Many simple heuristics have been used in practice, and there are also some recent advances on more rigorous approaches based on the ""contextual bandit"" model, referring to an analogy with the objective to maximize the sum of rewards earned through a sequence of lever pulls where an encoding of past performance provides context. However, there is still great room for improvement in terms of both practicality and performance guarantees. This project seeks to develop more practical and adaptive contextual bandit algorithms for such systems. The success of this project requires developing new algorithmic techniques as well as mathematical tools from statistics, optimization, machine learning, and their combinations in an innovative way, which advances the theory and practice of the field of online decision making. Education is integrated into the project through curriculum development and student mentoring. Outreach activities include collaborations with other universities as well as with industry, and also organizing related workshops at top conferences. <br/><br/>Specifically, the project aims at designing a family of practical contextual bandit algorithms which not only enjoy some information-theoretic worst-case guarantees but can also achieve much better performance when the problem exhibits some kind of ""easiness"". First, the project systematically studies different kinds of ""easiness"" measurements and develops and analyzes specific algorithms for each of these measurements. Second, the project further considers the question of whether it is possible to have a single algorithm that is optimal against all problem instances, where optimality is in terms of the best performance among a reasonable class of algorithms. Finally, the project implements all the developed algorithms and conducts empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, with the goal of releasing easy-to-use and publicly available software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Only over the last decade has this community begun to accord image processing and computational science the status of a principal partner among the other scientific and technological disciplines,such as chemistry, materials science, physics, imaging technology, and dendrochronology, blended together in the growing specialization of technical art history. From July 22 to 27, 2018, the 4th Gordon Research Conference on Scientific Methods in Cultural Heritage Research with the theme ""Leading Edge Applications of Data Science, Degradation Science, and Conservation Strategies for Cultural Heritage"" will take place in Castelldefels, Spain. This award is to support graduate students at US universities with backgrounds in engineering and science that include applicable expertise in imaging science and technology, digital signal/image processing, or computer science - to attend the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on Scientific Methods in Cultural Heritage Research.<br/><br/>The inclusion of digital signal/image processing and related expertise from electrical engineering and computer science in the foundation of technical art history helps align art history with the burgeoning digital humanities. The expansion from words to images is an active frontier in the digital humanities. Advances in the computational component of technical art history, i.e. computational art history, are very likely to spawn ""technology transfer"" to other branches of the digital humanities dealing with images and objects. The potential for these newly opened cross-disciplinary applications of digital image processing to raise new technical challenges is heightened by aiding the inclusion of - particularly young - digital image processing specialists in the foundation-building period of this new field of technical art history. Another benefit arises with the public's exposure to science and technology brought on by the expansion of technical art history research evident in the recent upswing in the incorporation of technical information and their computer-based visualizations into museum exhibitions. This is an unparalleled opportunity for students in engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, and other sciences to be present at the beginning of this young field's effort to incorporate their image processing and computational science skills. Their presence at this conference will also add to the perception of viability of computational methods in the future of technical art history. The connections the students make with domain experts with the potential for future collaboration are priceless to both sides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The formation of this dense water has regional and global importance because it influences the ocean current system. Polynya processes are also tied to the amount of sea ice formed, ocean heat lost to atmosphere, and atmospheric CO2 absorbed by the Southern Ocean. Unfortunately, the ocean-atmosphere interactions that influence the deep ocean water properties are difficult to observe directly during the Antarctic winter. This project will combine field measurements and laboratory experiments to investigate whether differences in the concentration of noble gasses (helium, neon, argon, xenon, and krypton) dissolved in ocean waters can be linked to environmental conditions at the time of their formation. If so, noble gas concentrations could provide insight into the mechanisms controlling shelf and bottom-water properties, and be used to reconstruct past climate conditions. Project results will contribute to the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) theme of The Future and Consequences of Carbon Uptake in the Southern Ocean. The project will also train undergraduate and graduate students in environmental monitoring, and earth and ocean sciences methods. <br/><br/>Understanding the causal links between Antarctic coastal processes and changes in the deep ocean system requires study of winter polynya processes. The winter period of intense ocean heat loss and sea ice production impacts two important Antarctic water masses: High-Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW), and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which then influence the strength of the ocean solubility pump and meridional overturning circulation. To better characterize how sea ice cover, ocean-atmosphere exchange, brine rejection, and glacial melt influence the physical properties of AABW and HSSW, this project will analyze samples and data collected from two Ross Sea polynyas during the 2017 PIPERS winter cruise. Gas concentrations will be measured in seawater samples collected by a CTD rosette, from an underwater mass-spectrometer, and from a benchtop Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer. Noble gas concentrations will reveal the ocean-atmosphere (dis)equilibrium that exists at the time that surface water is transformed into HSSW and AABW, and provide a fingerprint of past conditions. In addition, nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), argon, and CO2 concentration will be used to determine the net metabolic balance, and to evaluate the efficacy of N2 as an alternative to O2 as glacial meltwater tracer. Laboratory experiments will determine the gas partitioning ratios during sea ice formation. Findings will be synthesized with PIPERS and related projects, and so provide an integrated view of the role of the wintertime Antarctic coastal system on deep water composition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The initial ""Mining Seismic Wavefields"" NSF Geoinformatics grant has led to significant progress dealing with data volumes that would have been impossible to process when the project began. This award will fund an additional year of that effort and will maintain this momentum in technique development to complete the analysis of proof-of-concept projects on vast waveform data sets, and to deploy the cyberinfrastructure for wider use by the seismological community.<br/><br/>The premise of the research is that continuous and/or densely recorded data coupled with high performance computing and scalable algorithms can enable a network-based approach to earthquake detection that greatly improves the detection of weak and unusual events that would be difficult or impossible to detect using traditional approaches. Numerous seismological observations confirm that proximal earthquake sources generate similar signals. Exploiting the discriminative power of this similarity has led to many fundamental discoveries; however, most similarity-based detection methods require prior knowledge of the source waveform, or template. Blind/uninformed search for signals having unknown signatures based on pair-wise or multiple matches has seen some success, but nave implementations of this approach suffer from quadratic scaling of computation with time such that problems of interest are inaccessible  even for the most capable computers. Similarly, for dense networks, the availability of continuous waveform data motivates alternative detection schemes based on waveform similarity at adjacent stations. This project will further develop efficient data-mining techniques to enable scalable similarity search of seismic wavefields. Technical challenges to be addressed as part of the research for spatially sparse recording are to develop improved similarity-preserving compression for repeating signals detected over a network, and to improve post-processing of search output that will both isolate signals of seismological interest and minimize false detections. For spatially dense recording, this would extend recently developed wavefield matching techniques to similarity across adjacent stations, which would enable similarity search across unaliased elastic wavefields in four dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hence understanding the origin of continents and how portions of them remain stable for billions of years is central to understanding the evolution of the Earth. The old, stable cores of continents (cratons) are underlain by thick layers of mantle (the silicate layer of the Earth that lies below the crust), and these mantle roots are thought to contribute to continental stability. Yet, it remains debated how the continental mantle formed and evolved. In particular, the roles of magma or fluid interaction with the mantle, either during or after the continent formation, are unclear, although widespread layering observed in the cratonic mantle by seismic imaging may have been created by magma and fluid related processes. This research will constrain the formation and evolution of cratons by bracketing scenarios of melt/fluid and mantle reactions that are consistent with geophysical observations at mid-lithospheric depths. The research findings - disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and colloquia, and class room lectures and activities - will impact a wide range of Earth science sub-disciplines including petrology-geochemistry, mineral physics, geodynamics, and seismology. The proposal will support female PhD students in high P-T experimental petrology, mineral physics, and seismology, and support the research activities of several undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups. In addition to their own research, all the students will participate in discussions and write research articles together with all 3 PIs, learning how to combine concepts and methods from three different yet related sub-disciplines of solid Earth science. The proposal will thus directly further the educational experience and professional development of several students at various stages of their careers. The proposed research will also support an early career PI in the field of mineral physics and will aid the investigators in engaging K-12 students in science.<br/><br/>The stability of the continental interiors for 2-3 billion years is a key feature of the Earth's dynamical and thermal evolution. Understanding the geophysical structure, petrology, and material properties of cratonic mantles and the tectonic history that produced them is therefore one of the grand challenges of Earth science. A curious feature of subcontinental mantles is the presence of distinct reductions in seismic shear velocity at depths of 60-150 km, often called mid-lithospheric discontinuities (MLDs). Given the widespread occurrence of MLDs within cratons, their origins may be linked to craton formation; however, the causal link between MLD and craton formation is yet to be established, and MLD origins remain highly debated. One hypothesis is that MLDs represent zones enriched in CO2-H2O volatiles, which led to stability of hydrous and/or carbonate minerals or partial melts. This project will test this hypothesis by integrating results from experimental petrology, mineral physics, and seismology. Through laboratory experiments, this project will constrain the phase equilibria of cratonic mantle peridotites fluxed by mixed CO2-H2O volatiles at MLD depths, taking into consideration how the agent of volatile introduction may vary with craton formation models. The goal will be to determine the stability of hydrous and carbonate mineral phases over partial melts and obtain the compositions and proportions of mineral phases as a function of depth, temperature, and melt/fluid:peridotite ratio for each of the cases. Guided by the phase equilibria experiments and compiled xenolith data, thermoelastic properties of the appropriate end members and intermediate solid solutions of amphibole and mica will be determined using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) and first principles simulation. Using the mineral assemblages from experiments and updated elasticity data from new mineral physics, mantle velocity models will be predicted. These will be compared to mantle models for southern African craton (to be obtained by joint inversion of surface wave, Sp and Ps data) and North America, and used to calculate synthetic Sp and Ps receiver function stacks that will be compared to MLD observations globally. The proposed research will test whether one or several scenarios of fluid/melt infiltration into cratons, if any, satisfy the geophysical and petrologic characters of continental mantles at mid-lithospheric depths. Our research will also lead to specific products such as solidus parameterizations of depleted mantle+CO2+H2O; metasomatized mantle mineral assemblages as a function of P-T, infiltrated fluid/melt composition and fluid/melt:rock ratio; codes for computing seismic velocities for MLD-related assemblages with updated thermoelastic data; and observed mantle discontinuity parameters and mantle velocity models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also the largest ice-free region of Antarctica, and thus its deposits and landforms contain unique records of past climate not accessible elsewhere in the Antarctic continent or the world. In order to accurately interpret any geologic feature, however, we must understand how it forms and changes through time. In particular, in the Dry Valleys, we have a poor understanding of the rates and causes of one of Earth's most fundamental geologic phenomenon - physical rock breakdown. For example, the Dry Valleys lack moisture, which is thought to play a key role in rock breakdown in most other locations on the planet. What serves to fracture rocks in this seemingly inert environment? This project aims to answer that question by 'listening' as rocks crack in the Dry Valleys. We will instrument boulders with sensors that act as miniature seismographs, recording even the smallest microcracking on and within the rocks. At the same time, we will monitor the weather and environment around the rocks to record the conditions that trigger cracking events. While we collect these data, we will gather rock samples from deposits of different ages (from thousands to millions of years old) in the Dry Valleys. Measurements on these samples will allow us to see how quickly rocks breakdown and how their characteristics change over geologic time. The combined datasets will allow future scientists to more accurately understand the paleoclimates and landscapes of Antarctica, and possibly even Mars.

However, our current understanding of the relative role that different weathering factors (moisture, freezing temperatures, thermal cycling, salt crystallization or hydration, and wind abrasion) play in these and other environments is limited. Further, in the Dry Valleys, there has been no systematic evaluation of the variance in weathering and associated rock erosion rates, which may change significantly as a function of subaerial exposure duration, lithology, and texture. This research seeks to (1) characterize the primary drivers of rock breakdown, (2) better quantify erosion rates, and (3) determine the lithological and environmental factors that influence weathering and erosion in the Dry Valleys. Rock breakdown (cracking) will be recorded in real-time on in situ boulders using a custom acoustic emission monitoring system. By coupling acoustic emission data with micrometeorological measurements at and near rock surfaces, this study will directly test hypotheses relating to the environmental drivers of rock breakdown under this unique polar desert climate over short (minute to monthly) timescales. Cosmogenic nuclide techniques including a novel combination of 6 isotopes (Be-10, Al-26, He-3, Ne-21, Cl-36, C-14) together with rock property measurements (e.g., strength, elastic moduli, thermal properties) will be used to elucidate the complex relationship between long-term (kyr to Myr) boulder erosion rates, lithology, rock properties, and subaerial exposure duration. By synthesizing these measurements with short-term cracking data from the acoustic emission system, the proposed work will thoroughly examine which lithological and environmental factors and grain-scale processes are driving geomorphic evolution in the Dry Valleys. By constraining boulder erosion rates and determining their sensitivity to rock properties and age, the results will be directly applicable to cosmogenic nuclide exposure age studies in this region. Additionally, the resulting information on weathering processes and their relationship to rock morphology in the Dry Valleys can be used to address hypotheses as to formation of similar rock morphologies on Mars. The Project Investigators will participate in an elementary school outreach program run by Gonzaga University, and the project will support an undergraduate and graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this activity, participants will consider what it would mean for advanced computer systems to possess human-like understanding, explore how necessary it is for intelligent systems to exhibit such understanding, and discuss approaches to imbuing these systems with such a capability.  Engagement of a multidisciplinary community will develop new and actionable insight into how we define, design, implement, and control complex systems that overcome this barrier of meaning.  The workshop will likely also lead to outcomes and follow-on activities to benefit AI education and public awareness regarding the state of current artificial intelligence, including its limitations and potential vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>The approach in this workshop is to explore how complex systems extract meaning from the information they encounter. Workshop participants will engage questions about the function and mechanisms of ""understanding"" or ""extracting meaning"" in complex systems across many disciplines, and focus specifically on the relevance of human-like understanding for creating artificial intelligence systems that are reliable, adaptable to novel situations, and robust against adversarial attacks.  Understanding the nature and necessity of understanding remains among the deepest intellectual challenges in AI research. Workshop discussions will be aimed at clarifying common questions and identifying possible novel pathways to answering these questions. Organizers will publish both technical and general-readership summaries communicating the results of the workshop discussions concerning the notions of understanding or meaning as phenomena in diverse disciplines, and how these phenomena relate to, or enable, the robustness that will be needed for safe and trustworthy AI in the real world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the mass of the Higgs boson has the value it has. To answer these questions, it is necessary to go beyond the present picture of the Universe described by the Standard Model to the next phase of development, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Investigations in BSM physics probe such questions as why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. This project focuses on the study of the properties of special types of particles, mesons, whose nature can reveal information about fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model. <br/><br/>The work in this award will use data collected at the Belle and Belle-II experiments at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) laboratory in Japan. The new Belle-II is built around the interaction region of an asymmetric electron-positron collider. The main goal of the Belle program is to detect particles made of a quark-anti-quark pair, so called mesons. In particular those mesons made of charm quarks (charmonium) and bottom quarks (bottomonium). These mesons are described in the SM by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). By studying these mesons, one can probe for BSM fundamental physics processes such as Charge Parity (CP) violation, rare meson decays and possible exotic particles which could indicate the presence of Dark Matter. <br/><br/>The Belle Experiment at KEK in Japan has the world's largest data samples recorded at the bottomonium resonances in the mass range of 10 GeV, the so-called Upsilon resonances. At these resonant energies the electron positron beam particles have a much higher probability of producing B mesons, allowing experimenters to acquire large statistics and observe rare phenomena. The central aim of this RUI program of research by the Luther College group is to study the spectroscopy of bottomonium and related states, with a focus on resonant states that probe the limits of our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and improving the theoretical understanding in lattice QCD (the techniques used to make computer predictions of QCD calculations). The Luther College program provides an unusual opportunity for undergraduate students to become meaningfully involved in a world-leading experiment, taking part in every aspect of Belle data analysis, and in the development of software tools for the upgraded experiment, Belle II.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the program are exemplary, fostering greater exposure to scientific research among students and teachers in rural Northeast Iowa, through masterclasses for High School students and providing computational opportunities for young women through the regional Girls Who Code Organization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through the interdisciplinary research, teachers are immersed in an exploration of the design, fabrication, and application of nanometer-scale components in optical, electronic, mechanical and biomedical systems. The teachers will strengthen their capacity in science and engineering practices through their participation, enabling them to engage their students with engineering concepts within the sciences. Mentored research projects challenge participants to engage in engineering problem solving, and the knowledge gained will help participants develop sustainable curricula and activities in STEM education. RET teachers will return to their classrooms with an improved and relevant skill set to foster their student's interest in engineering disciplines and to succeed with the ambitious educational goals of the Massachusetts Adapted Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This RET Site is focused on underserved schools in the greater Boston area with the goal of recruiting participants from a diverse group with 80% of the teachers coming from resource-limited (high needs) schools. Additionally, teachers from schools with high percentages of underrepresented students in STEM and/or high percentages of low-income families will be encouraged to participate. The RET Site will work directly with STEM Nexus from the Greater Boston area and Eastern Massachusetts to target schools and individual teachers that have interest in STEM but have limited resources to implement these activities. This site will also engage local Boston area companies as potential research locations for RET participants and longer-term partners in K-12 outreach activities. <br/><br/>Integrated nanomanufacturing research is an inherently interdisciplinary intellectual area that is evolving rapidly at the intersecting frontiers of microelectronics, optical science, materials engineering, and biomedicine. Three thematic research areas will serve as the foundation for this RET Site: three broad themes of integrated nanomanufacturing: nanophotonics, nanostructures, and nanomedicine. While engaged in mentored discovery of new devices and fabrication at the nanoscale level to explore optical systems, participants will develop critical skills, awareness and confidence necessary to advance in academics and research in the future. The summer experience involves training sessions, hands-on nanofabrication tool training activities, scientific research in partner laboratories, seminars on classroom integration, and faculty pedagogy discussions. Participants will also be introduced to the idea of Societal Engineers, a core concept at Boston University to develop engineers who can connect their training to integrate content and applications reflecting how science and engineering is practiced in the real world.

Liquid crystal elastomers are rubbery materials that can reversibly change from one shape to another in response to changes in their environment. This shape change occurs without requiring external power and control equipment, which is particularly useful in implantable medical devices where water can disrupt circuitry, batteries are difficult to charge, and space is limited. This research effort will enable the synthesis and fabrication of liquid crystal elastomers, with dimensions smaller than a human hair, which bend, stretch, or twist near body temperature. These small structures will be able to penetrate tissue and the subsequent shape change will enable strong adhesion of synthetic materials to soft, wet, and moving tissues of the human body. This new strategy will address a critical national need for improved tissue adhesives. For example, many common treatments, such as hernia repair, require synthetic materials to adhere to the soft tissue, and adhesion failure leads to increased healthcare-related costs and pain. These smart materials will also serve as powerful tools to demonstrate basic scientific concepts to the next generation of scientists and engineers. <br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/><br/>The proposed work will enable the design of biodegradable physical adhesives using the programmed shape change of microscale liquid crystal elastomers. Microneedle arrays that penetrate soft tissue and then undergo controlled shape change to enhance tissue adhesion are envisioned. The large, programmable, and reversible shape change of liquid crystal elastomers make these materials ideal candidates for the design of active microstructures. This work will overcome three critical limitations currently preventing the use of liquid crystal elastomers in biomedical applications: 1) the temperatures that induce shape change of these materials are too high for use in biomedical applications, 2) the biodegradability of these materials is uncontrolled, and 3) the shape change is difficult to program in 3D microscale structures. This award supports development of liquid crystal elastomer chemistries and post-processing strategies to tune transition temperatures and biodegradability. Furthermore, this award enables micromolding techniques to process these materials in 3D microstructures that undergo complex shape change. These active microstructures will be characterized for the ability to create mechanical adhesion to soft tissue that resists both tensile and shear loading.  Research activities will be coupled to primary, secondary, and post-secondary student interactions, to help train the next generation of STEM graduates. Design-based learning modules will be created and assessed that teach fundamental concepts in chemistry and physics through the constructs of smart materials and medical devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But learning a second language as an adult is hard, especially when it is very different from one's first language. This study will examine whether greater similarity between the first and second language 1) facilitates learning in the second language and 2) effects the brain processes that underlie learning. English speakers and Hebrew speakers are compared on their ability to learn words in a ""new"" language, created by the investigators, that shares features with both English and Hebrew. The investigators use functional brain imaging to examine whether learning familiar language features uses different brain systems than when learning unfamiliar language features. The study will also examine the effect of variability in the training items on learning. High variability involves training many different words with similar features whereas low variability training involves repeating fewer words more times. More broadly, the results will uncover aspects of the brain basis for second-language learning and will inform methods for improving second-language instruction. The project will integrate research and education by providing training to students at all levels from undergraduate to postdoctoral and includes a visiting scholar program between the US and Israel. The investigators will also hold workshops on second language learning for local professionals in both countries.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to our understanding of the role of domain-general principles of learning and consolidation in second-language acquisition. It will examine the relative involvement of mediotemporal and neocortical learning mechanisms in the acquisition of a second language, depending on the presence of pre-existing experience with similar abstract linguistic structures in the first language. The structure of words varies across languages. In Hebrew, many words have a three-consonant root, such as the word perax (meaning ""flower""), which contains the root p-r-x (meaning, ""to bloom""). In contrast, most complex English words contain a base and an affix. For example, piglet contains the base ""pig"" and the affix ""let."" This study will shed light on the role of compositional processes in second-language learners and suggest a mechanism by which transfer from the first language may affect such compositional processes. Differences in the linguistic properties, such as morphological structure of the two languages, may influence the neurocognitive basis of learning. Finally, parameters that can improve learning and enhance extraction of morphological regularities from new words will be examined. <br/><br/>This project is supported by a partnership between the National Science Foundation and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Open Compass is an exploratory research project to conduct academic pilot projects on an advanced engineering testbed for artificial intelligence, culminating in the development and publication of best practices. <br/><br/>Open Compass will: 1) engage pilot projects and research groups, documenting approaches, experiences, and lessons learned; 2) conduct training events, in-person and using the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center's wide area classroom; 3) organize and conduct a workshop focusing on advanced AI technologies; 4) integrate experiences gained through open research collaboration with those of industry experiences to identify a comprehensive set of best practices; and 5) publish results and best practices in peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and technical reports. The broad community will benefit from publication of research results, experiences, and a knowledge base of best practices. The research community will gain access to new technologies on which to develop algorithms and applications, along with insight across new fields of those technologies' applicability and important trends for AI. Open Compass will promote workforce development through student involvement in pilot projects and training and provide feedback to industry for to enable more efficient future AI technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For scientific results generated through computation to be considered robust and become widely accepted, the computational techniques should be automated, reproducible and trustworthy. By exploring the practices of gravitational-wave astronomy researchers working on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project, this project seeks to create a set of case studies documenting broadly applicable methods for reproducible computational science. Specifically, the project will explore and articulate what reproducibility, automation, and trust mean with respect to computation-based research in gravitational-wave astronomy, identify, implement and validate a set of experimental practices, that will include computational techniques, and finally, evaluate how these experimental practices can be extended to other science domains. <br/><br/>Robust computational science builds on rigorous methods and is composed of three key elements: (1) reproducibility, which enables the verification and leveraging of scientists' findings; (2) automation, which speeds up the exploration of alternative solutions and the processing of large amounts of data while reducing the introduction of errors; and (3) trust, providing security and reliability for software and data, while supplying the necessary attributes for confidence in the scientist's own results and results from others. This project explores robust science in the LIGO project through the following activities within the context of gravitational-wave astronomy: (1) articulating the roles of reproducibility, automation, and trust in gravitational-wave astronomy; (2) identifying, implementing and validating a set of experimental practices, including computational techniques; and (3) advancing towards the project's vision of general computational methods for robust science by evaluating how the experimental practices can be extended to other science domains. The project will develop and use a survey to collect information about LIGO workflows that are composed of a series of experimental, computational, and data manipulation steps. The analysis of the survey will result in a document that describes what reproducibility means in the LIGO context and help identify potential improvements in LIGO's practices. The project will generalize these findings by documenting a mapping of LIGOs original and enhanced approach to other science workflows including those of the molecular dynamics and bioinformatics communities. The final project document will target a broad audience that includes researchers and students at various levels of education, with the goal of introducing them to the concept of robust computational research, and the underlying concepts of reproducibility, automation and trust, teaching them to access code, data, and workflow information to regenerate findings, learn about the scientific methods, and to engage in STEM research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Theoretical research results in phonology are often based on relatively sparse data from works that are themselves based on impressionistic phonetic transcriptions of native speaker utterances. Relatively recent technological advances, coupled with more sophisticated experimental methods, provide more accurate, extensive, and quantifiable information on the nature of sound systems. Phonologists are increasingly employing these methods, and have also begun investigations with large-scale corpora and databases. Such research has already had an impact on the field, and it is imperative that graduate students be familiar with, if not specifically trained in, a variety of such methods. To this end, the workshop will feature talks, posters, and tutorials on the workshop theme, and presents a unique opportunity to share methods, and insights into their use, among fellow phonologists. For students, it is an opportunity to learn about these methods from some of the top researchers in the field. Our emphasis on under-documented and endangered languages, including signed languages, will highlight the importance of diverse language communities and encourage students to become involved in fieldwork. This not only has the benefit of contributions to the study of diverse languages, but is also beneficial to the career prospects of graduate students: many recent offers of tenure-track phonology positions have been made to fieldworkers.<br/><br/>The importance of new data-collecting methodologies for phonological theory is highlighted here with very brief descriptions of phenomena that have been illuminated by some of these methodologies. All of these examples rely on data from under-documented and/or endangered languages, and this will be a major emphasis of the workshop. (1) Careful acoustic and articulatory analysis has revealed that speech sounds that have long been thought to be inert to phonological processes may actually participate in those processes, creating distinctions that are difficult to distinguish impressionistically. This illustrates the importance of conducting experimental phonetic research to inform phonological theory. (2) Acoustic analysis of pitch contours based on data collection with a number of native speakers of relevant languages has established that lexical and grammatical tone alignment can be contrastive irrespective of phonological structure. Such a result has important ramifications for the analysis of tonal systems, but would have gone unnoticed without detailed acoustic research that helps inform phonological representations. (3) Recent articulatory studies of nasal sounds have shown that they may be characterized by lingual, pharyngeal, and/or voice quality changes in addition to characteristic velum lowering, implying that the phonetic implementation of nasality is multidimensional. Such results could only be definitively found using articulatory measurements. (4) As spoken corpora of under-documented and endangered languages are constructed and become available, phonologists are able to employ computational tools to mine these data for phonological information and generalizations. Researchers now have the potential to combine both approaches, and indeed many field phonologists are making significant contributions in both domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed study will focus on five overarching goals: 1) developing a general physical/sedimentological model applicable to all types of PDCs; 2) evaluate the accuracy of numerical models in representing PDC-related phenomena through community-based validation and benchmarking exercises; 3) drive future research on PDC hazard assessment (e.g., ""validation"" experiments, field measurements, uncertainty analysis); 4) provide a community-wide interpretation framework for volcanic flow hazard assessment studies; 5) developing quantitative skills in geoscience education and increasing awareness of the community about the potential and limits of numerical tools (""model literacy"") and the complementarity of experimental (both laboratory and field based) and numerical studies. This framework will provide critical information about the uncertainties in hazard assessments that depend on these models. The drive for this knowledge stems from the limited success of current hazard assessment studies to capture the real hazard potential of such volcanic flows. The broader goals for the proposed work are: (1) bringing multi-disciplinary teams together to discuss the relationship between field studies, computational modeling and hazard assessment; (2) increasing familiarity with and limitations of computational modeling tools to both geoscience students and the broader community; and (3) tailoring the hazard assessment to the needs of the user communities.<br/><br/>The general approach is based on an iterative process of integrating data, theories and models. In this process, the data collection (through field investigations, laboratory experiments, remote sensing, monitoring and numerical modeling) allow investigators to revisit and revise scientific theories and principles (for example, a general physical/sedimentological PDC model), which then serve as a basis for computational and experimental models (through calibration, validation, benchmarking and prediction) that can then be applied to the collected data to improve the understanding of the dynamics of PDCs, as well as their hazard assessment studies. This integrative study will follow the methodology proposed for the validation of computational fluid dynamics codes designed to simulate complex industrial and technological systems, based on a hierarchical process of comparing numerical models with experiments and observations.

An effective procedural model can produce a variety of detailed, visually interesting, and even pleasantly surprising results.  Unfortunately, such models are difficult to author, requiring both visual creativity and programming expertise.  More people could be empowered to create and use procedural models were it possible to deduce them from examples.  The current project will tackle this long-standing open problem in computer graphics by building on the PI's prior work to develop a research program investigating new approaches to learning procedural models from examples by combining probabilistic programs with neural nets; programs are expressive enough to represent a variety of visual content, while neural networks provide flexible learning from data.  Project outcomes will help democratize procedural modeling by allowing users to create procedural models with examples rather than by writing code, so that a wider demographic of creative professionals and enthusiasts can participate.  All code and data produced will be released as open-source, to allow other researchers and developers to apply and extend the new techniques.<br/><br/>Because graphical content is often hierarchical, (probabilistic) grammars are typically used to procedurally model it.  However, such content is also characterized by continuous attributes: colors, affine transformations, and so on.  While grammars can be extended to support some of these attributes, there are no general-purpose methods for learning such models from examples.  Existing approaches either ignore continuous attributes or are specialized to one type of content (e.g., building facades).  This research presents a new general-purpose approach for example-based learning of procedural models which generate discrete hierarchical structures with continuous attributes.  The key insight is representing a procedural model as a probabilistic program whose control flow and data flow can be governed by neural networks.  Like a grammar, such a program can naturally represent (possibly recursive) hierarchical structure.  The neural network logic of the program can represent complex functions which generate continuous attributes such as transformations.  The model is efficiently learnable with stochastic-gradient-based methods and has the potential to scale from small numbers of examples to large datasets.  The initial focus will be on learning procedural models of 3D scene graphs, which are 3D objects composed of a hierarchy of parts.  The research will then expand into learning procedural models from large datasets of examples, applying the techniques to domains beyond 3D scene graphs, and leveraging unstructured inputs such as images as examples.  Project outcomes will include new mathematical frameworks for learning procedural models from examples, algorithms for efficiently solving the learning problem, and evaluations of the quality of content generated by learned models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interior regions of these plates are believed to be rigid and strong, while boundaries in the ocean where the plates spread apart, mid-ocean ridges, are thin, hot, and weak. In contrast to the standard expectations of plate tectonic theory, observations find that sections of mid-ocean ridges often shift, or jump, from weak boundaries to strong plate interiors. As a result, jumps of mid-ocean ridges can change the size and shape of the tectonic plates and even create micro-continents (small slivers of continental material) when they jump into continental regions. Mid-ocean ridge jumps are believed to result after some process weakens a nearby plate interior.  However, scientists do not know the reasons or driving forces behind this weakening. Previous studies examined mid-ocean ridge jumps in a 2D geometry, but could not address several key processes that would control their formation, leaving a gap in our understanding of plate tectonics.  In this study, innovative laboratory and state-of-the-art 3D numerical simulations will be used to isolate the processes that lead to mid-ocean ridge jumps. Understanding these processes will improve understanding of the thermal evolution of the planet and the locations of potential mineral resources associated with past hydrothermal activity. The educational component of this CAREER award has two primary goals: 1) to motivate young students (~10-18 years old) to pursue STEM-based inquiry through interactive, marine geology-based video games that are engaging, entertaining, and provide easily accessible opportunities for in-depth exploration of marine geology topics, and 2) to involve several interdisciplinary groups of undergraduate students in a hands-on, engaging experience where they learn STEM skills and explore marine geologic data.<br/><br/><br/>Observations of numerous relic spreading centers and micro-continents formed by sudden relocations or jumps of ridge axes indicate that mid-ocean ridge jumps regularly shift to new, off-axis locations. This project's primary research goal is to quantify the processes that govern ridge jumps and thereby test the hypothesis that there are predictable length- and time-scales for ridge jump formation. This goal is split into three objectives that aim to quantify: 1) the role of magmatic accretion in propagation of nascent rifts adjacent to established ridges and consequent formation of transform faults or overlapping spreading centers; 2) mantle plume-induced ridge jumps in oceanic lithosphere; and 3) micro-continent formation by jumps into continental lithosphere. These objectives will be addressed with 3D numerical simulations and innovative laboratory experiments using colloidal fluids. To establish testable predictions from these models and experiments, results will be used to derive functional relationships between length- and time-scales of ridge jumps and observable quantities such as spreading rate, ridge migration rate, seafloor age, and melt flux. These relationships will be evaluated through comparison to a new database of jump statistics including jump distance, final segment length, transform fault or overlapping spreading center formation rate and location, and the time between repeat jumps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The deep-time history of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere may help us quantify the role of this greenhouse gas in abrupt climate change events in the geological past, giving a better perspective towards climate projections under future scenarios of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. This project will refine proxy estimates of atmospheric carbon dioxide that are based on an understanding of how the properties of stomatal pores in the leaves of Ginkgo trees respond to elevated carbon dioxide concentration. This proxy relationship, established using controlled experiments on cultivated Ginkgo leaves, will then be applied to the ancient record of atmospheric carbon dioxide using fossil Ginkgo leaves that are common in sediments deposited during periods when Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and climate varied substantially. These more precise estimates of ancient atmospheric carbon dioxide will thus help to refine our understanding of the sensitivity of Earth's climate system to greenhouse gas concentrations and facilitate more accurate projections of changes in climate, ice volume and sea level that will result from anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. More accurate projections of these future scenarios will have significant societal and economic implications for infrastructure and food production. The project will also educate students and citizen scientists about the scientific method and insights from this research by involving them in collecting specimens, making measurements and analyzing data.<br/><br/>Sensitivity of global temperature to atmospheric pCO2 is difficult to determine by direct atmospheric measurements because feedbacks in the Earth system play out over millennia or longer. This research will develop a reliable, temporally dense proxy record of pCO2 for the late Paleocene and Early Eocene period of warm climates (~60-53 Ma) using stomatal properties of fossil Ginkgo leaves. The researchers will first refine a proxy relationship between Ginkgo leaf stomatal properties, and then apply this proxy to dense and temporally well-constrained fossil records of Ginkgo.  To establish the response of modern Ginkgo to elevated pCO2 concentrations, trees will be cultivated under experimental conditions at three elevated CO2 concentrations in open-top chambers, while monitoring stomatal density, size and index, as well as carbon isotopic composition and rates of photosynthetic assimilation and transpiration, temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation. These data from experimental cultivation will be used along with survey data of modern Ginkgo leaves, to allow the researchers to evaluate modeled relationships between paleo-pCO2 and fossil stomata. Once this response is calibrated for modern Ginkgo biloba, the results will be applied to extensive collections of fossil Ginkgo wyomingensis from the terrestrial sediments of the Paleogene in the Rocky Mountains. This record, combined with records of paleotemperature from the marine and terrestrial realms will be used to evaluate the role of atmospheric CO2 during episodes of geologically rapid temperature increases (hyperthermals).  Better estimates of paleo-pCO2 will contribute substantially to refining our understanding of Earth's climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide and increase our understanding of controls on past warm climates in the geological record.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current statistical and econometric techniques for estimating and assessing factor pricing models often produce spurious statistical results. The goal of this research is to develop more reliable new statistical techniques that will work well in an environment that makes use of big data sets on assets returns and that will address the empirically-important issues of observed strong co-movements between asset prices and the weak explanatory power of some risk factors. Given the broad range of applications for factor models, the techniques and insights from this research will also be useful for researchers and policy makers working with macroeconomic data, including Federal Reserves and Central Banks.  In addition, a key educational component of this research involves the training of graduate students in the area of econometrics.<br/><br/>This research demonstrates the statistical problems of the currently widely employed two-pass Fama-MacBeth procedure and further creates more reliable new statistical methods. The investigator combines several modern econometric and statistical approaches such as large-dimensional asymptotics, drifting-parameter embedding (as in the weak-identification literature) and factor models, in order to better approximate empirically relevant features of commonly-used data sets. Each of these approaches brings its own distinct statistical challenges that the investigator will solve by proposing a new and original estimation procedure.  One of the insights from this research is that strong cross-sectional dependence between asset returns such as an approximate factor structure can be exploited to create proxies for dependence and that this can be used to build a correction. The weakness of observed factors is an additional serious complication that the investigator aims to solve. This research will develop new techniques for three distinct tasks: (i) estimation and inference on risk premia; (ii) testing whether the proposed factor pricing model is correctly specified; and (iii) assessment of the quality-of-fit of a pricing model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Damage to urban forests was widespread. Many trees were uprooted or lost leaves and limbs. As in previous storms, tree damage from Irma is unlikely to be felt equally across communities. Since urban forests provide many important services, understanding what causes differences in impacts between communities is critical to recovery. Patterns of damage may depend on proximity to buildings and which species were present. Management practices, as well as average household income and age of housing, are also likely to be important. Therefore, the goal of this project is to understand how local ecological, social and economic conditions relate to the severity of damage to urban forests from Hurricane Irma. Irma provides a unique and urgent opportunity to learn how urban forests are affected by hurricanes, allowing communities to better predict where tree loss may be high. This will lead to better preparation and effective recovery plans for future storm events. Presentations and workshops will provide information to urban planners and tree care professionals, helping improve urban forest design, tree risk assessment and storm management efforts. <br/><br/>This project will provide an opportunity to directly evaluate urban tree canopy responses to hurricanes, and differences in tree damage related to biophysical and social characteristics. This project will build on existing measurements, utilizing field inventory data obtained in the months prior to the storm in Tampa, Gainesville, and Orange County, Florida. Field plots will be re-visited to obtain post-storm data assessing tree failure. These data will be used in conjunction with remotely sensed data obtained before and after the storm, as well as census data to establish socioeconomic context. This combination of field measurements, census data, and remotely sensed data products will allow inference about relationships between socioeconomic and forest structural factors and tree failure. The findings and predictions will directly address larger-scale questions about how urban forest ecosystems are altered in the face of future disturbance scenarios. This project will also improve estimates of the overall consequences of hurricanes to urban forests, allowing policy makers to make better decisions to manage the ecosystem services of this important resource.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is unique in its singular focus on auditory displays and the array of perception, technology, and application areas that this encompasses, which include for example data sonification, auditory wayfinding, auditory graphs, speech interfaces, virtual environments, and associated perceptual, cognitive, technical, and technological research and development.  Many of the interdisciplinary research and development efforts are of direct relevance to persons with perceptual disabilities, especially visual impairments; for example, developing wayfinding systems for the blind requires research into effective distance cues and object identifiers used in auditory displays.  Research into the efficacy of auditory graphs may be used to help visually impaired students and scientists participate more fully in science.  Even household devices can have more effective auditory displays that provide richer information than the basic ""beeps"" they presently tend to generate.  A common approach in this field is universal design, wherein a display strategy is developed once, to be used by all kinds of users, including those with and without specific access issues.  This year's conference theme is ""Sonification as Art / Design / Science / Research""; more details about ICAD 2018 are available online at http://icad2018.icad.org/.  The ICAD Think Tank is a doctoral consortium that promotes scholarship and networking among new researchers in this important emerging interdisciplinary area.  It will help shape ongoing and future research projects that have clear and important implications for development of assistive technologies and universal access.  The doctoral consortium will afford participants exposure to a larger community, allowing them to bond among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality and culture, scientific discipline, and institution, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.  This year, the organizers expect that up to 10 U.S.-based Think Tank Scholars will have their travel and attendance heavily subsidized.  Additionally, up to 3 U.S.-based Think Tank Scholars local to the Michigan Tech area (including Wisconsin and Minnesota) will have their attendance at ICAD 2018 (but not travel and accommodation) subsidized, for a total of 13 Student Scholars.  Some NSF funds will also be used to support travel by research faculty panelists (both U.S. and foreign-based), since they provide great value to the US students, but NSF funds will not be used to support travel and participation of non-U.S. students.  The organizers will be proactive in promoting diversity among the attendees; stage in their academic program, research topic, gender and disability status are examples of dimensions on which participant diversity will be pursued, while geographic and institutional diversity will also be strongly considered.  To further promote diversity among the Student Scholars, no more than two participants will be selected from any one university.<br/><br/>The ICAD Think Tank, a full-day event which will take place on June 10 immediately preceding the conference, is open to graduate students at all stages of their educational program, including both Masters and PhD students.  Exceptional undergraduates who have demonstrated interest in pursuing this field in their graduate careers may also be considered.  The Think Tank will bring together students from diverse backgrounds (e.g., engineering, computing, music, and psychology), so that they can experience the broad spectrum of approaches to auditory displays, assistive technologies and universal design.  The Think Tank will develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research, by providing participants with a friendly and open, yet rigorous, scientific forum in which to present their research ideas, to listen to ongoing work from peer students, and to receive constructive feedback from a panel of distinguished experts.  Panel feedback is designed to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to related research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  The Think Tank will also offer invited speakers and discussion groups (e.g., to provide students with relevant information about important issues for doctoral candidates, whether they are considering academic or industrial career paths).  Student participants will present their work via posters during the ICAD 2018 technical program, and via extended abstracts published on the ICAD 2018 website.  The Think Tank Chair will provide a summary and review at the conference banquet, which will includes an overview of the event's success, and in which all Think Tank participants (students and panelists) are introduced to the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will lead to a great increase in the number of located and characterized seismic events of various kinds and will potentially identify patterns in earthquake occurrence that could inform hazard and near-term rupture forecasting. The initial ""Mining Seismic Wavefields"" NSF Geoinformatics grant has led to significant progress dealing with data volumes that would have been impossible to process when the project began. This award will fund an additional year of that effort and will maintain this momentum in technique development to complete the analysis of proof-of-concept projects on vast waveform data sets, and to deploy the cyberinfrastructure for wider use by the seismological community.<br/><br/>The premise of the research is that continuous and/or densely recorded data coupled with high performance computing and scalable algorithms can enable a network-based approach to earthquake detection that greatly improves the detection of weak and unusual events that would be difficult or impossible to detect using traditional approaches. Numerous seismological observations confirm that proximal earthquake sources generate similar signals. Exploiting the discriminative power of this similarity has led to many fundamental discoveries; however, most similarity-based detection methods require prior knowledge of the source waveform, or template. Blind/uninformed search for signals having unknown signatures based on pair-wise or multiple matches has seen some success, but nave implementations of this approach suffer from quadratic scaling of computation with time such that problems of interest are inaccessible  even for the most capable computers. Similarly, for dense networks, the availability of continuous waveform data motivates alternative detection schemes based on waveform similarity at adjacent stations. This project will further develop efficient data-mining techniques to enable scalable similarity search of seismic wavefields. Technical challenges to be addressed as part of the research for spatially sparse recording are to develop improved similarity-preserving compression for repeating signals detected over a network, and to improve post-processing of search output that will both isolate signals of seismological interest and minimize false detections. For spatially dense recording, this would extend recently developed wavefield matching techniques to similarity across adjacent stations, which would enable similarity search across unaliased elastic wavefields in four dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reality is more complex. On the one hand, even in places where one language is dominant, there will often be groups who primarily use a different language in their daily lives, such as at home or in church. On the other hand, many people are able to speak more than one language, and simplified maps are incapable of representing this effectively. To achieve a more realistic sense of language distributions, it is necessary to explore linguistic knowledge and use at the level of the individual. In this multidisciplinary project, the investigators will use advances in the available tools for mapping complex social patterns for the spatial and linguistic dynamics of a rural region of Cameroon where the average adult speaks five different languages, many of which are endangered. The level of individual multilingualism found in this rural environment far exceeds what is typically found in the United States. The project will support the training of a graduate student and build future opportunities for international collaborative research. The resulting research on socio-spatial patterns and language use may be usable by the U.S. in the areas of public health, national security, and connections on the ground in Cameroon. The future adaptation of these methods will facilitate investigating the spatial patterns of other dimensions of social behavior, such as trade and marriage, or to compare the spread of linguistic features with the spread of diseases. <br/><br/>The investigators will utilize new ways of representing and analyzing language distributions using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and individual-level data to understand the extent to which people tend to learn languages spoken by those that they live near and languages spoken by their friends and family members. These individual-level factors will be examined with regard to the dynamics and nature of the community in which these individuals live. A particular focus of the work is understanding the relationship between spatial, social, and cultural factors in accounting for an individual's linguistic knowledge. High-resolution spatial data will be integrated with detailed descriptions of individual patterns of language use and analyzed from the perspective of spatial and social network analysis. Much of the data will be collected using smartphones, allowing information to be gathered at a scale that is unprecedented for linguistic research on endangered languages. The tools and methods to be developed will be general in nature and applicable to any part of the world and will be especially useful for the investigation of the language dynamics of rural areas with limited infrastructure. A better understanding of how and why people come to speak different languages will provide better information to policymakers in the domain of language planning.

Very rich classes of correlation-driven topological phases have been predicted theoretically; however, the existence of only few of them has been confirmed in real materials. The relevant challenges are the limitations of currently available theoretical and numerical methods for correlated quantum systems, as well as the lack of physical guiding principles to direct the search for many correlated topological states. This project addresses both these challenges.<br/><br/>The research activities comprise three main thrusts: 1) The PI will further develop a symmetric tensor network framework and numerical algorithms suitable for investigating correlated topological phases. The tensor network can be viewed as a new language for quantum many-body physics capable of capturing topological properties of quantum states. 2) By applying this framework, the PI will search for model systems that realize correlation-driven topological phases, including models for correlated transition-metal materials. In addition, excitation properties of candidate topological materials will be computed and compared with experiments. 3) The PI will develop symmetry-based guiding principles that are independent of microscopic details, aiding the search for topological states in materials.<br/><br/>The research is closely connected to quantum information science and algebraic topology in mathematics, and it could bring new insight in these disciplines. The educational activities include developing pedagogical courses, lectures, and journal-club series for undergraduate and graduate students, with emphasis on the new states of matter discovered in modern condensed matter physics. The PI will develop and maintain an interactive website hosting research and teaching materials, which will include demonstrations of topological phenomena in condensed matter physics and tensor networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the discovery of the Higgs mechanism in 2012 was a crowning achievement for the Standard Model, many mysteries remain, including the role of the elusive neutrino. Neutrinos are elementary particles that rarely interact with ordinary matter.  The Standard Model predicts three types of massless neutrinos.  However, experimentally, we know that neutrinos do have very small masses, and yet they permeate the universe.  Because they have mass, they can change from one type to another.  Measuring properties of these changes, and comparing them to theoretical predictions, provides a promising pathway to discover how neutrinos shape our universe. To that end, the neutrino community is embarking on a challenging quest to complete the picture of neutrino physics through the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), which will be a massive, 40,000-ton instrument optimized to detect neutrino interactions about a mile underground at Sanford Lab in South Dakota.  This facility, being built during the next 10 years, will observe interactions of neutrinos produced at Fermilab and traveling 800 miles to DUNE and, due to its large volume, can also detect particles coming from astrophysical sources.  This work seeks to develop ways to look for and identify signals for new physics.<br/><br/>The DUNE experiment offers a unique opportunity for a rich astro-particle and exotic physics search program, including: observations of low-energy astrophysical neutrinos, e.g. from supernova core-collapse, thus lending itself to multi-messenger astrophysics, and searches for other rare processes, e.g. proton decay and neutron-antineutron oscillation. If observed, these signatures would have profound implications for particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The rarity of these signals requires continuous, high-resolution readout and processing of Time Projection Chamber (TPC) data from the entire DUNE detector. The resulting data rates for such a data acquisition (DAQ) scheme are prohibitively large and create a challenge: to develop readout and DAQ systems that are capable of significant data reduction and efficient self-triggering with zero deadtime. This award will carry out a unique and ambitious R&D program to develop novel readout and triggering techniques involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) deployed on FPGA devices, including a demonstration of some of these techniques at the upcoming SBND experiment, beginning in 2019.<br/><br/>This CAREER award will strengthen the undergraduate research experience of Columbia University students, including underrepresented groups. The project will also provide unique opportunities of involvement in cutting edge research in readout electronics, detector R&D, and computer science applications for data handling and data analysis, and further promote interdisciplinary research opportunities for physics and non-physics majors through a Seminar Series developed and organized by the PI.  The award will sponsor an additional slot in Nevis Lab's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program for two years, specifically for non-physics majors interested in particle physics. Outreach to the public and local high-school students will also be carried out through lectures at local high schools and the Nevis Science-on-Hudson public lecture series. Recruited summer high-school students will develop a virtual reality visualization of a supernova burst, as ""seen"" in a Liquid Argon TPC.

Although this powerful theory tells us so much about activity on the surface of our planet, relatively little is known about how plate tectonics starts and the underlying physics that allows it to continue over time. There is little doubt that convection of the mantle drives the motion of these plates.  However, the details of how this process occurs and how it originated are far from complete. Plate tectonics is defined by special boundaries, namely subduction zones, ridges, and strike-slip fault margins at the edges of continents.  These boundaries are formed at the top of the mantle, which requires some special physical properties that localize deformation through certain mechanisms. Thankfully, the Earth has provided an important clue through the abundance of rocks called mylonites that are found at plate boundaries. These fine-grain rocks provide evidence of the physics that might tell us how plate tectonics started and how it persists today. The investigator's research captures the essential physics of the mechanisms that lead to development of mylonites that persist as weak zones and ultimately develop as plate boundaries. This work is the primary focus of the doctoral dissertation project of a graduate student in the PI's lab and will help develop the student's skills as a scientist in addition to providing fundamental research necessary for the future progress of our understanding of the generation of tectonic plates. The experimental techniques developed in this research will be applied to new undergraduate lab exercises that demonstrate complex processes involving feedback between microstructural development and mechanical properties of the material. <br/><br/>The Earth is unique in the solar system in that it displays plate tectonics. The physical explanation for this behavior remains a major challenge.  This research focuses on the influence of (i) a secondary solid phase and (ii) localized deformation on lithospheric strength with implications for plate tectonics. The project emphasizes a transformative approach to laboratory experiments designed to investigate the role of a second phase in the deformation of olivine, the primary phase in Earth's upper mantle. To achieve steady-state microstructures and thus steady state creep rates, the team will fabricate two-phase samples with grain sizes significantly larger than the steady-state grain size. They will then deform these samples in torsion to large shear strains, such that dynamic recrystallization produces a steady-state grain size.  The dependence of strain rate on stress is determined through rate or load steps. Some samples will be annealed after large strain to measure grain growth in thoroughly mixed, dynamically recrystallized samples. Grain-size reduction due to dynamic recrystallization of coarse-grained rocks is well established both experimentally and in observations of natural shear zones. This process leads to a grain-size sensitive process and associated strain weakening. However, without continued deformation and dynamic recrystallization, grains will grow and ultimately lead to hardening that makes reactivation of a shear zone difficult. In polyphase materials, pinning of grain boundaries by a secondary phase inhibits grain growth, allowing localization to persist or to be more easily reactivated. For this process to be effective, the phases must be thoroughly mixed. Understanding both the chemical and mechanical processes that lead to phase mixing and localization is the primary goal of this proposal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Occasionally, insect populations explode throughout broad geographic ranges, and then collapse back into their smaller permanent breeding zones within months or years. Neither the mechanisms of population expansions nor declines are well understood, but our knowledge of the declines is particularly poor. This is a major challenge in organismal biology and ecology, with significant implications for human society. This research project will take advantage of an ongoing outbreak of the South American locust (Schistocerca cancellata) to test the hypothesis that the ability for S. cancellata to attain a balance of nutrients optimal for growth limits their capacity to maintain persistent high populations over broad regions of South America. Locusts are a major challenge for food security globally, with outbreaks causing 80-100% crop losses. In the future, working collaboratively with government plant protection agencies, this research can be directly applied to strategies to improve livelihoods, human and environmental health, and global food security. Moreover, this award will support postdoctoral and student training, and cross-cultural exchange. <br/><br/><br/>The South American locust (Schistocerca cancellata) is experiencing its largest population upsurge in 60 years, expanding beyond its permanent breeding zone in northwest Argentina into a much larger part of Argentina and beyond into Bolivia and Paraguay, causing national emergencies in those three countries. One hypothesis for why S. cancellata do not persist at high densities in their invasion zone, which is supported by preliminary data, is that S. cancellata in their expansion zones are unable to obtain food of sufficiently high carbohydrate:protein ratio to maximize their fitness. This poor nutrition then leads to population decreases in their expansion zone. This carbohydrate insufficiency hypothesis will be tested in this project by: 1) assessing the plant macronutrient contents and feeding behavior of S. cancellata in the field at sites differing in median plant macronutrient ratios; 2) measuring the short-term effects of dietary macronutrient content on the performance of juvenile S. cancellata in the field, and 3) measuring the whole-lifetime effects of dietary macronutient content on the performance of S. cancellata in the lab under controlled environmental conditions. Together these experiments will test the mechanisms potentially responsible for fluctuations in locust populations in the recession and invasion zones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Communication through these lipid membranes was thought to be primarily due to protein molecules with the lipid barrier playing a passive role.  However, recent discoveries show that cells tightly control both the protein and lipid composition of its membranes to perform a broad range of functions. As a result this creates very unique and uneven distributions of lipids and proteins across different membranes. These uneven distributions or asymmetries can only occur if the cell is putting in additional energy because normal temperature driven effects will tend to mix lipids uniformly.  Even more interesting is that if the cell fails to maintain this asymmetry, the result  can lead to disease or even cell death. In this proposal the researchers want to answer a key question: What is the energetic cost of maintaining lipid asymmetry? This question has proven difficult to answer since multiple measurements have given varied results. Preliminary findings using a unique advanced technique called time resolved small angle neutron scattering (TR-SANS) was that cholesterol and other lipids move very slowly across a single membrane, taking tens to hundreds of minutes to move, or ""flip-flop"", across the lipid membrane. Our result on cholesterol is particularly interesting, and controversial, since the consensus is that the cholesterol moves rapidly through a single membrane - taking less than a second.  Interestingly, it was recently shown that cholesterol itself is very unevenly distributed across the membrane and, if cholesterol moves fast across the membrane, this would mean that proteins are working very hard and using more energy to keep this necessary difference across the membrane. This project will investigate the movement of lipids and cholesterol across the membrane?s lipid bilayer. The results of this study will provide direct information of the factors influencing lipid and cholesterol distribution across biological membranes and the energetic cost of maintaining this distribution. Understanding of membrane regulation and dynamics will therefore be greatly enhanced. The long-term goal of the project is to address the grand challenge of finding key principles that govern the movement of lipids between and within membranes. Ultimately this project seeks to connect how membrane structure is maintained, how the membrane lipids actively engage during signaling processes, and how this affects their dynamics.<br/><br/>The findings will be communicated to the scientific community through publications and conference presentations, and to the public through general science lecture events in local science museums and libraries. The principal investigator will train undergraduate and graduate students in STEM fields. In addition, summer outreach research projects engaging undergraduate students from colleges based in the Chicago area and whose backgrounds are under-represented in the physical sciences will be pursued. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>This CAREER award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to The University of Illinois at Chicago  is to investigate the transport of lipids in membranes.  The great variety of lipid molecules in the cell membrane suggests they play a complex role in cell function. Distinct lipid composition amongst different membranes within the cell suggests directed functionality. Within the plasma membrane itself, there is an asymmetric distribution of lipids between the outer or exocellular facing leaflet and the inner or cytoplasmic facing leaflet, and the physiological fate of cells depends on the strict maintenance of this asymmetry. This uneven distribution is mediated by concrete lipid transport mechanisms whose function maintains the identities of the different cellular membranes. Identifying and understanding these mechanisms is currently a subject of intense study. Reliable values of passive lipid translocation rates are a necessary starting point for a detailed mechanistic understanding of the lipid distribution landscape in cellular membranes, and the purpose of this study is to provide them.<br/><br/>Using an in-situ non invasive technique: time-resolved small angle scattering, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance as a complementary technique, the researchers will directly obtain the flip-flop rates of lipids and cholesterol in membranes and study changes to the rates in different biological contexts.<br/><br/>Time resolved small angle neutron scattering (TR-SANS) is a technique with nano spatial resolution capable of measuring the time dependent population of lipids, distinguished by deuteration, in vesicles. Deuteration has the advantages of not altering the chemical identity of the lipids under study, which have been found to have a profound effect on how they move across membranes. Further, deuteration of lipids - particularly of cholesterol - will allow probing membranes as complex as those found naturally in cells. <br/><br/>The findings will be communicated to the scientific community through publications and conference presentations, and to the public through general science lecture events in local science museums and libraries. The principal investigator will train undergraduate and graduate students in STEM fields. In addition, summer outreach research projects engaging undergraduate students from colleges based in the Chicago area and whose backgrounds are under-represented in the physical sciences will be pursued.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current project leverages the research infrastructure that was supported by prior awards to examine how peer effects, network connections, and employer demand shape career outcomes for doctoral students. It integrates comprehensive administrative data for 113,000 doctoral students, UMETRICS research data, Proquest data on dissertations with information on fields of study and research, and restricted Census Bureau data on earnings and employment outcomes. Dara integration will occur under the umbrella of the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science (IRIS). The project will contribute new knowledge by articulating and testing key aspects of a novel conceptual model of STEM career choices. This theoretical and empirical work will establish basic facts about how demand and training conditions shape early STEM career choices that can be determine only through the integration of separate datasets. The project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>The research design integrates three approaches - peer-based, network-based, and demand. In their peer-based approach, the researchers propose to take the composition of peers in entering graduate cohorts to be quasi-random and estimate how the composition of peers interacts with their own characteristics. A second set of analyses involves identifying labs from the data and estimating how the composition of the persons in a lab relate to outcomes. The network-based approach will be used to examine how individual differences in social capital shape doctoral student outcomes. The demand will answer the analytical question of the effect of actual and perceived labor market demand on the choice of careers. The analysis will begin with a description of the early career outcomes of students from undergraduate dropouts to college graduates, from master's students to Ph.D. dropouts to doctoral recipients.  In addition to enhancing the infrastructure to conduct robust workforce development research, the project will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the role and impact of peer networks on STEM workforce development<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>This project addresses physics, astronomy, and chemistry education at the high-school level. Spectroscopy is the single most important diagnostic tool in the sciences, and is required for inquiry at the frontiers of science across many disciplines, yet is unavailable to most classrooms. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory proposes to design, implement, and investigate the impact on students of an innovative curriculum supplement called the Spectrum Laboratory. The Spectrum Lab will be an online, interactive learning environment that enables students to make use of the database of publicly available spectra from research scientists, as well as from students. The online learning resource and associated materials are purposefully being developed and tested with a demographically diverse set of schools. The project will determine how the design of a spectroscopy workspace can help students to use spectra while gaining fluency with a range of important science practices. The project's significance and importance is to greatly increase the opportunities for high school students to engage in authentic inquiry. Being able to evaluate and interpret real-world data is a hallmark of data literacy that is developed with Spectrum Lab. Project will potentially benefit the field through advances with respect to education and diversity, and benefit society by equipping high school students with the perceptual and cognitive factors that promote students' reasoning about spectra. <br/><br/>The Spectrum Lab's initial design applies research-based principles recommended for educational interfaces that engage students with graphical data advancing knowledge from prior research into understanding of how students make sense of spectroscopic data and its graphical representations. The project will be developed in collaboration with partner teachers in up to eight high school classrooms, representing a diverse population of learners, and then tested with a national group of 20 teachers with 600 to 800 students. A mix of quantitative and qualitative measures, including pre/post surveys and assessments, analysis of student project work, classroom video, and teacher surveys, will help address researcher's questions about students' experiences with the Spectrum Lab. The data to be gathered will be used to iteratively improve the design of the laboratory to aid students understand the source of these authentic data coming from spectroscopy to address real-world science questions of interest and importance to them. The Spectrum Lab will enable students to engage in a broad range of inquiry projects that were previously inaccessible, including projects near the frontiers of science. The students will become involved in their authentic inquiry projects, where each activity engages them in key science practices, including generating model spectrum plots to make predictions, assessing and interpreting data, and reasoning from evidence (and models) in support of a claim. The students will be using graphs of well-documented experiments and in physics, more challenging graphs of spectra of less familiar wavelength axis. The students in chemistry will learn how to relate the bright lines observed in an atom's spectrum to energy levels of the atom.  There will be studies that track students' eye movements show that students associate the peaks or valleys of a spectrum with individual atoms in a molecule, rather than with the overall properties of the molecule. The resources developed by the project will be freely available online for teachers and researchers. The Spectrum Lab is an advance in education technology that uses modern tools for enabling interactive data visualization. Its features enable students to integrate and apply the most important elements of science practice, such as the ability to draw evidence-based conclusions, as well as the ability to gather, evaluate and interpret data, intended to help students' science practice more closely resemble how research is done. The Spectrum Lab will modernize a critical part of high-school science classrooms, help teachers meet the expectations of the Next Generation Science Standards, and will better prepare students for college work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More recently, the hallmarks of criticality have been found in solids where quantum fluctuations play a central role. In such solids, fractal organization was proposed, with self-similar structures and patterns akin to those displayed by snowflakes or rugged shorelines. Imaging these electronic fractals is challenging because of the need to explore multiple length scales spanning the nanometer to millimeter range. In this study we use a recently-developed X-ray nanoscope of very high accuracy. The goal is to reveal the unifying traits of quantum critical matter. In a broader context, the understanding and control of quantum phases of matter, such as superconductivity, is a stepping stone toward the development of future quantum technologies, quantum computing, efficient energy transport, and powerful medical scanners. On the educational front, this project aims to engage undergraduate and graduate students in basic and advanced X-ray science. Activities include field trips to national facilities and the development of new academic tools and modules. These initiatives serve a broad base of participants, including college students and middle/high school teachers, with a focus on underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Quantum solids exhibit collective phases of matter that cannot be found in ordinary metals or semiconductors, engendering technologically-relevant properties such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, and magnetoelectricity. Some of these phenomena appear near a quantum critical point, where electrons tend to organize into self-similar patterns that look the same at all length scales. The resulting fractal geometries are a hallmark of quantum criticality and unfold in the form of inhomogeneous electronic textures with spatially-modulated spin and charge distributions. Imaging these textures is a pressing experimental challenge, which requires probing a broad range of length scales. While these electronic orders often escape detection by conventional diffraction, they can be measured using resonant X-ray scattering. The recent development of a resonant X-ray nanoprobe (with a spatial resolution better than 100 nm) offers a unique tool to visualize the nanoscale texture of electronic orders and reveal emergent charge/spin fractal patterns in quantum critical solids. Three known quantum critical systems are investigated: cuprates, nickelates, and chalcogenides, whose electronic phases can be tuned by doping, pressure/strain, and composition, respectively. The primary goal of this research is to disclose the fractal nature of the electronic fabric in systems manifesting distinct forms of electronic orders in the quantum critical regime. This project is executed in close collaboration with light source facilities, and fulfils a crucial educational mission geared toward the training of students and teachers in the field of X-ray science, using in-house and large-scale facilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop on Developing a Global Inventory of Brain Initiatives aims to advance discussions on coordinating Brain Initiatives around the globe.  It focuses on the development of an International Brain Initiative Inventory that will collect and report key information about each regional initiative in an accessible fashion.  Although there are significant independent efforts to catalog the developing neurotechnologies and approaches for acquisition and management of data, these efforts are not coordinated and do not communicate effectively with one another.  As such, there is a need for the implementation of a live inventory of Brain Initiatives, to promote the coordination of large-scale projects that require multinational involvement and to reduce duplication and increase efficiency of resources developed through various brain initiatives globally.  The International Brain Inventory will serve to broaden accessibility to Brain Initiative tools, data, and other resources, as well as increase collaboration by US investigators with investigators from other countries.  This workshop critically informs inventory development by providing input from a diverse group of US and international neuroscientists and communicating inventory goals to the broader neuroscience community.  In addition, the workshop serves to build relationships among global Brain Initiatives.  By working to inform the International Brain Inventory, ultimate goals of this project include to: (1) increase accessibility of all countries to Brain Initiatives work and products, and (2) promote multinational collaborations.  Further, by communicating these efforts to the public, the workshop enhances awareness of global brain research efforts and interactions between the US and other Brain Initiatives.<br/><br/>There are three specific aims of the workshop:  1. To consider what content to include in an International Brain Initiative Inventory, and advise on content and structure, with a focus on what would be most useful to the scientific community; 2. To suggest approaches for dissemination of inventory information and other mechanisms that encourage use and communication across International Brain Initiatives; and 3. To recommend approaches for receiving feedback from the neuroscience community and evaluating the effectiveness of the inventory.  The primary product of the workshop is a publication that will summarize the discussion and articulates the group?s perspective on key aspects of a global inventory as outlined above:  inventory content, input and structure, dissemination, and evaluation.  The publication will also outline steps for engaging the scientific community in this work.  A secondary product of the workshop is to propose strategies for communicating inventory efforts to the public.  An additional goal of the workshop and surrounding collaborative work of its participants is the strengthening of dialog and relationships between neuroscientists and Brain Initiative leaders across many countries, governmental agencies, and foundations to accelerate our understanding of brain function<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some challenges have positive effects. For example, the ALS Ice Bucket challenge involved people dumping a bucket of ice water over their heads to raise awareness of and funding for Lou Gehrig's disease.  Others, however, encourage people to engage in behaviors that risk physical or psychological harm. For example, the Cinnamon challenge involves eating a spoonful of cinnamon, which can cause severe respiratory distress, while the Blue Whale challenge encourages a series of increasingly self-harmful behaviors culminating in suicide.  Although there is much folklore and hearsay around such harmful challenges, actual studies and data about them are sparse.  To address this, the project team will conduct a series of interview studies along with quantitative analysis of social network data around the Cinnamon and Blue Whale challenges. Analyses will examine both individual-level and message-level factors that lead people to participate in and spread these challenges. The results will inform the development of preventative measures to mitigate the spread of harmful viral Internet challenges. Findings will also provide a better understanding of how to protect vulnerable individuals who are exposed to the challenges from both the direct potential risks of participating and indirect potential risks (e.g., through the normalization of self-harm and peer pressure to engage in it).<br/><br/>The project will address a number of specific research questions, including: 1) better assessing the extent to which viral social media challenges have caused real harm and pose a public health risk to social media users, and 2) identifying characteristics of both the messages containing these challenges and the individuals receiving and spreading them that predict risk, adoption, and spread of the challenges. The work is organized into two main thrusts.  In the first, the team will conduct semi-structured, retrospective interviews with approximately 30 adolescent and young adult social media users (ages 13-25) and/or their families, who report being harmed or committing self-harm after engaging in social media challenges prevalent at the time of the studies.  The questions will be structured to assess factors known to contribute to self-harm contagion effects (such as graphic depiction of the challenge, peer pressure, and support for self-harmful activities), as well as to probe people's own motivations and decision-making around participating in such challenges.  The second main thrust involves larger-scale quantitative analysis of digital trace data about self-harmful challenges from five popular social media sites.  This portion of the study will first include constructing and cleaning the dataset (both in terms of protecting personal information and capturing data relevant to the challenges). Next, the researchers will employ qualitative coding of how the challenge messages deviate from the Suicide Prevention Resource Center's evidence-based safe messaging guidelines. These analyses are intended to identify strategies that authors use to spread the challenges as well as the potential risk each poses. Finally, computational modeling will relate message characteristics to measures of message reach such as likes, views, and shares.  Together, these research activities will provide much-needed empirical evidence of real-world social media behavior and individual decision-making around these harmful challenges. The data can be used to inform theory development regarding the spread of viral challenges, as well as interventions to mitigate their future harms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists are working to understand the causes and consequences of this change and have a critical role in communicating their findings with diverse stakeholders. The pace of polar change demands continuous investment in training and educating the next generation of polar professionals who are prepared to be leaders in academia, government, industry, and policy. The Joint Science Education Project (JSEP) and the Joint Antarctic School Expedition (JASE) are two NSF-sponsored polar-focused programs that provide significant opportunities for training the next generation of STEM professionals and for polar-science outreach. JSEP, a project of the Joint Committee, was initiated in 2007 to educate students and teachers from Greenland, Denmark, and the U.S. The program brings US students together with Danish and Greenlandic students in Greenland where the group spends three weeks studying the causes and consequences of Arctic environmental change. JASE, a project in collaboration with the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), takes U.S. students to Antarctica to work alongside Chilean students and examine Antarctica's rapidly changing ecosystems. This award provides funding for Dartmouth College to lead the U.S. contributions to JSEP and JASE for the next four years. Dartmouth will organize a nation-wide application process to select high school student participants each year and will work with the international program coordinators to design student activities and learning experiences. In addition to coordinating each field-based program for U.S. high school students, Dartmouth will work to broaden the impact of these programs by sending a team of graduate student and faculty researchers with polar field experience to lead scientific components of JSEP and JASE, work with Greenlandic and Chilean educators to disseminate JSEP and JASE polar science outcomes to local audiences during the field-based expeditions, adapt JSEP and JASE polar science field activities for use in U.S. and international classrooms, provide training in cross-cultural science communication for diverse audiences to Dartmouth graduate students and the campus community, and assess skill- and content-based outcomes for high school and graduate student participants in JSEP and JASE. Societal benefits include building international networks of students, educators, stakeholders, future leaders, and polar scientists; diversifying the US polar scientific workforce, and generating polar science educational tools and modules that are freely accessible to students and teachers in multiple languages. This program addresses national priorities by developing a U.S. scientific workforce that is knowledgeable about the Arctic and the Antarctic, regions that are of growing importance to U.S. economic development and national security.<br/><br/>The Joint Committee, a high-level government forum between the U.S., Greenlandic, and Danish governments, initiated JSEP during the International Polar Year in 2007. Since its inception, high school students and teachers from Greenland, Denmark, and the U.S. have traveled to Greenland to participate in two JSEP educational programs, Kangerlussuaq Science Field School and Science and Education Week. In 2013, the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), invited the United States to participate in their Expedicin Antrtica Escolar (EAE), a program to promote awareness and appreciation of Antarctica in young Chileans. Since then, U.S. teams have joined three JASE expeditions, which provide hands-on experience with Antarctic research to high school students and teachers from both nations. Both JSEP and JASE aim to 1) educate and inspire the next generation of polar scientists, 2) build strong networks of students, teachers and researchers among the participating countries, and 3) improve language and communication skills by taking teams of students to the polar regions to share in polar science activities. The program will strengthen international scientific ties between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland and improve the understanding of polar science for students and citizens of all three countries. Dartmouth will conduct assessments of outcomes for the current high school students and graduate student polar fellows as well as surveys of alumni from previous U.S., Danish, Greenlandic, and Chilean participants.

Experiments proposed will enhance the current understanding of magmatic processes in subduction zones and gauge the contribution of saline fluids on the stability of granitic-forming melts at shallow crustal environments. The proposed study will promote understanding on the mass and heat transfer associated with the deep Earth's hydrological cycle, wherein water is carried into the mantle at subduction zones and released back to the surface at volcanoes. Understanding the introduction, transport, and storage of C-O-H volatiles in the interiors of terrestrial-like planets is profoundly linked to the nature of habitability, the origin of life, and the external evidence of conditions favorable for life. Structural characterization of silicate melts and their glass-forming abilities are directly relevant to materials and glass science. Experimental data will be made available to the public through the Library of Experimental Phase Relations, and a data repository hosted within the institution's web infrastructure. A series of lectures and lab demonstrations/tours will be delivered to George Mason University (GMU) undergraduate/graduate students, and some undergraduate students from GMU will participate in the project during a 10-week summer internship program, creating a strong partnership between a research-institution (CIW) and a public state-funded University (GMU).<br/><br/>The solubility and solution mechanisms of volatiles in silicate melts and aqueous fluids governs mantle fluxes, and affects the properties of coexisting phases such as diffusivity, electrical conductivity and viscosity. This has a profound effect on the physical and chemical heterogeneities between the magmatic systems developed along mid-ocean ridges, shallow continental crust and subduction zones. Very little is known, however, about the silicate melt-fluid phase relations, especially for saline fluids enriched in dissolved alkalis, alkaline earths, and halogen ions. This proposal aims to explore the effect of dissolved salts, fluid pH and melt peralkalinity on the phase relations between silicate melts and crustal brines to better understand melt polymerization and C-O-H solubility in the coexisting phases. This project will constrain the melt-fluid relationships as function not only of pressure/temperature but also of relative abundances and compositional variability of the coexisting phases. In a series of hydrothermal diamond anvil cell experiments, Raman vibrational/Infrared spectroscopy will be employed for the in-situ and real-time investigation of the structure, volatile composition and properties of silicate melts coexisting with electrolyte-enriched aqueous solutions. Experiments will reveal the interplay between CO2 solubility, network-modifying cations and extent of melt polymerization. The in-situ studies will be complimented by bulk CO2 solubility measurements in glasses quenched from melt-fluid equilibria at high temperatures and pressures. At the core of this effort is an innovative integration of ex-situ and in-situ experimental protocols along with real-time chemical and spectroscopic analysis. In this study, use of ultrapure synthetic diamond anvils will increase tremendously the effectiveness of analytical methods that monitor in-situ melt-fluid interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To explain this diversity, scientists examine how new species form and describe how differences accumulate between them. Most scientists agree that adaptation to different habitats frequently initiates the formation of new species. The genetic causes and consequences of species formation, however, remain a mystery. This project takes advantage of two pine tree-feeding insect pests that are ""caught in the act"" of species formation. Although there are many differences between them, the redheaded-pine sawfly and the white-pine sawfly interbreed at low levels in nature. This suggests that species formation is not quite complete. Adaptation to different pines appears to be a key factor that reduces gene exchange between these species. Laboratory crosses and field experiments will be used to identify the genetic regions responsible for different pine adaptations. The results should reveal how these differences affect rates of gene exchange between these species in the wild. This work will provide essential knowledge for preserving biodiversity and combatting pests. Additionally, this project will develop integrated research/teaching projects that provide scientific experiences for the public and diverse undergraduates.  <br/><br/>Understanding the genetic basis of ecological speciation requires identifying links among genotypes, reproductive isolation, and genome-wide genetic differentiation. This project takes advantage of this pair of hybridizing sawfly species that differ in host-use traits and reproductive barriers. First, a QTL mapping approach will link genetic variation to variation in host-preference and host-performance traits. Second, a field trapping experiment will link host-preference phenotypes to adult habitat isolation. Third, a field experiment manipulates both the host plants and host-use traits to link host-performance traits to fitness and reproductive isolation. Fourth, full-genome re-sequencing of overlapping and isolated pairs of populations of these species will reveal the demographic history of divergence and patterns of genetic differentiation. The complementary educational efforts will train citizen scientists to trap and identify sawflies and non-STEM students to screen samples and interpret a diagnostic PCR assay. Together, these data will be used to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in hybridization. Additionally, STEM students will participate in field and lab experiments that connect genotype, phenotype, fitness, reproductive isolation, and differentiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Selenium is a required micronutrient for most living organisms.  At elevated concentrations, however, Se is a toxic element of increasing environmental concern. Selenium bioavailability and toxicity largely depends on the form, or oxidation state, of the compound. Microorganisms, including fungi, play an important role in controlling and transforming Se chemical speciation by promoting a variety of chemical reactions. The processes by which fungi promote Se transformations, however, are largely unresolved, thus limiting knowledge of their specific contributions in nature.  Using a genome-enabled approach, this research will examine and resolve the relevant fungal biogeochemical processes that transform Se speciation and ultimately influence the fate and distribution of selenium in nature. Results from the proposed research will also directly inform new technologies for Se bioremediation and will be of additional interest to government and local stake-holders who are regulating or managing Se issues. Through formal student training and engagement in public science communication in collaboration with local museums, this project will further engage, inform, and inspire students and the public on the important role that microorganisms play in maintaining and improving the overall health of planet Earth.  <br/><br/>To better understand the impact of fungi on biogeochemical processes that influence the fate of selenium in nature, this research will illuminate the currently unresolved molecular mechanisms and pathways that contribute to the aerobic reductive transformation of soluble, toxic Se oxyanions (selenate and selenite) to insoluble Se(0) and organic, volatile Se(-II) compounds by a diverse suite of environmentally-relevant Ascomycete fungi.  The specific research objectives are to (1) identify the fungal mechanisms of selenate and selenite reduction in oxic environments, (2) assess the effects of key nutrients and trace metals on fungal Se transformation mechanisms and reaction products, and (3) investigate particle size, morphology, and structure of Se biomineralization products with respect to fungal growth conditions and Se reduction pathway. The genome-enabled approach will elucidate the genes and proteins that contribute to Se reduction by linking their expression to specific functions and resulting Se biominerals and organoselenium compounds. This approach will lead to the development of gene regulatory networks for these common fungal species, which will be highly beneficial for predicting the effect of environmental or biological change on Se speciation and will further benefit the advancement of fungal research in environmental and biological sciences.

We emphasize the generation of high quality research and integration of psychological and neuroscientific theory with the design, execution, and interpretation of data. We select ten students annually for mentored research projects, especially undergraduates from ethnic-minority serving, public two-year and four-year institutions in the New York metropolitan area. Students also attend weekly didactics: a seminar that dually focuses on psychology and neuroscience principles/research methods and professional issues/career development; a journal club that familiarizes students with scientific literature through learning to select, read, critically analyze, and present summaries of original research papers; and a statistical methods seminar that emphasizes data analysis, statistical reasoning, and presentation of research findings in academic contexts. Given the importance of adhering to ethical norms in research, our students also undergo an intensive scientific ethics training. As a capstone experience, students present a poster at the BC Science Research Day, where they compete for awards based on the quality of their work and ability to communicate their findings. Many of our students work with their mentors to publish their results in peer-reviewed journals. In addition, the project has a RET (Research Experiences for Teachers) component, which provides local middle and high school teachers with coursework in research methods, mentored laboratory experience, and professional development opportunities to enhance their research competencies and raise the level of science education in local middle schools and high schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process starts at the seaward boundary of the river discharge (plume) and it affects circulation and flow near the river mouth and throughout the adjacent coastal region.  Although the area where this river-ocean interface occurs represents a small region of the ocean, it is very important to ocean mixing and is often poorly resolved in circulation models used to predict environmental conditions in coastal regions. As part of this investigation the researchers will carry out field measurements and utilize numerical models to define variability in the structure of the seaward boundary of the freshwater discharge, and the mixing that occurs there.  These processes will be examined for different river discharge and tidal conditions.  In addition, this study will assess how much of an ebbing riverine outflow is cycled through the seaward boundary and evaluate the overall importance of this region to mixing the total river discharge to a near-ocean salinity.  The outcomes from this work will reveal the details of the physical processes taking place at the riverine-ocean interface and improve the predictive capabilities of large-scale models.  In addition, the advances gained from this study will ultimately allow better prediction of the fate and transport of pollutants, nutrients and water masses in the ocean. During the period of this project three graduate student will supported contributing to building scientific capacity.<br/><br/>The frontal region of a river plume is the seaward boundary that separates a buoyant coastal discharge from ambient ocean water.  Oceanic fronts of all scales act as significant energy sinks over several orders of magnitude through mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Although significant efforts have advanced knowledge of plume dynamics over the last several decades, fundamental gaps still exist in our understanding of frontal evolution, and the role of the front in establishing the dynamics in the interior of the plume and in the overall plume mixing budget. The objective of this proposal is to understand the evolution and significance of frontal processes across a range of scales, from small scale propagating discharge fronts to intermediate scale shelf fronts bounding an ebb pulse, and to identify the mechanisms controlling the evolution of a front from engineering scales to geostrophic scales. Our hypothesis is that the relative importance of frontal mixing to overall mixing in the plume is controlled by the ratio of a frontal length scale representing water mass interaction with the front, to the overall plume length scale, and diminishes as the plume front evolves, due to diminishing connectivity between the plume front and the source through the ebb tide.  We hypothesize that mechanisms of diminishing connectivity include both weakening of barotropic gradients through the plume as well as Coriolis effects as the plume becomes geostrophic.  This work will be pursued using 21st century current, hydrography and microstructure measurements in the plume front and core to assess mixing using various techniques, as well as hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic realistic and idealized numerical models.  The field effort is focused on the mid-sized Merrimack and Connecticut rivers, which are well studied and provide an ideal setting to observe frontal evolution in regions with and without strong tidal currents.  Results from the field study will allow calibration and validation of models, which can then be used to understand similar frontal processes across a wide swath of parameter space.<br/><br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These montane forests depend on water from winter snow and summer rain. This water is provided by different climate systems. The North American Monsoon climate system occurs each year across the southwestern US. It delivers summer rain through near-daily thunderstorms that move northward from the Gulf of California. Winter snow comes from longer-term storms that originate above the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California and move eastward. Water from these different climate systems have different chemistry and timing. Using tree rings this research project will provide insights into how forest growth and water use has responded to past climate variation and how variation in one part of the season (e.g., winter or summer) influences forest growth and water use in the following seasons. This region has experienced reduced snow packs, warmer winter temperatures and an increase in droughts. Therefore, it is important to understand how the change in water availability is affecting the growth of these forests. An understanding of how drought controls forest growth is crucial to not only predicting natural resource production, but also predicting and controlling forest fire frequencies. The research will contribute to an exhibit entitled: 'The Fingerprints of Forest Responses to Climate Variation', in The Laboratory of Tree Ring Research and at the Biosphere 2 campus at the University of Arizona. The research will include the training of two post-doctoral fellows and numerous undergraduate students, with an emphasis on recruitment from the large Hispanic and Native American student populations at the University of Arizona. <br/><br/>This research will explore whether variation in the amount of summer or winter precipitation over the past fifty years, in any given year, is negatively correlated with the amount of precipitation during the previous winter or the following summer, respectively, and whether those correlated influences have affected forest wood production and water-cycling in predictable ways. Researchers will examine how trees mobilize stored sugar resources to sustain wood production and water cycling during years with extremely low winter or summer rainfall, and the degree to which the use of stored sugars differentially buffers the effects of extreme winter or summer drought.  This project will design a new generation of mathematical models to better predict how variation in winter versus summer precipitation influences forest wood production and water use, and whether there are limits to sustaining wood production following multi-year droughts. The research will utilize advanced techniques in the analysis of stable isotopes in the cellulose extracted from individual tree-rings. A major part of the studies will focus on tree rings produced during the 1960's and 1970's, when atomic bomb testing produced an atmospheric spike of radioactive 14C that was subsequently incorporated into trees. The 14C provides a detectable tracer that facilitates determination of the age of stored sugars in trees and the utilization of those tagged sugars in the production of tree rings specifically, and timber generally.  New theory will be developed to provide a foundation for understanding and predicting how trees incorporate stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen from the atmosphere into their wood.  All data will be deposited in the International Tree Ring Data Bank, which is administered by the US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and which has been used in numerous multi-national collaborations on understanding how climate controls the health and vigor of forest ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The plumage of birds encompasses a spectacular array of ornamental plumages long appreciated for their beauty, yet we know little about how the color of plumage patches or their size is influenced by genes. It is generally thought that the plumage color of male birds is a signal of quality to females choosing mates. Several hypotheses have now been proposed linking the size and color of plumage ornaments to various physiological and genetic pathways related to health, including those involved in cellular metabolism, growth, oxidative stress and immunity. Any one pathway could provide a general explanation for how bird colors signal quality in males, but these genetic pathways may interact in complex ways that can only be understood using genome-wide analysis techniques. Here the researchers plan to examine these pathways using next generation gene sequencing of the genome of a brightly colored warbler. The types of pigments in this bird (black colored melanin and yellow colored carotenoids) are widespread across species and, thus, will provide a general model for many researchers studying the development of colorful ornaments.  As part of the project the researchers will conduct workshops on genomics at local colleges, at an international behavior meeting and, in Belize, for a local zoo and local conservationists.<br/><br/><br/>This study will use genomic analyses to test several recent hypotheses for the genetic basis of ornament expression in a warbler, the common yellowthroat. This warbler is one of a few species of birds in which females are known to choose mates based on ornamental traits that are associated with indices of fitness. Interestingly, sexual selection targets different ornaments in different populations of the common yellowthroat. In Wisconsin, females prefer males with larger black masks, whereas in New York females prefer males with larger, more colorful yellow bibs. The investigators have already shown that mask size in Wisconsin and bib color in New York are honest signals of similar aspects of male quality in each population. Based on these results, the investigators plan to use a genomics approach to determine if: 1) elaborate ornaments are related to the expression of genes in growth, immunity and oxidative stress pathways, as predicted by recent hypotheses, and 2) if these traits exhibit molecular parallelism where the same genetic pathways are most closely associated with the ornament preferred by females in each location. To maximize the probability of finding differences and to expand the tests of parallelism, the study will also incorporate geographic comparisons with other subspecies and a closely-related species in Belize, which have larger differences in ornament size and color.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to ensure a vigorous participation by the US astronomical community, this award will fund small travel grants to enable approximately 150 US astronomers to attend the General Assembly. This award will also provide small travel grants to approximately 50 US astronomers per year to attend various international meetings over the next 3 years.  Preference will be given to early-career astronomers and astronomers from less-endowed institutions. Scientists supported by this program will come from a wide range of educational institutions, museums, planetariums, etc. The experiences they gain from this meeting will be shared with a broad segment of the US population, exposing them to the global nature of astronomy and the importance of international collaboration to the advancement of science and technology.<br/><br/>The small travel grant program will be administered by the American Astronomical Society (AAS), the principal professional organization for US astronomers. They have very successfully and economically administered similar programs in the past, and the proposed procedures ensure that these funds will provide the maximum benefit to the astronomical community at minimal cost. The AAS will solicit proposals, select awardees, issue funds to be used for airfare only, collect receipts and meeting reports from the grantees, and prepare a final assessment and report on the entire program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It enables experiments that would otherwise be physically impossible, allows for testing under rigorously controlled conditions, and is an essential technique for ensuring reproducibility in the scientific process. In protein evolution, simulation is the key to understanding processes that act on time scales that exceed a human life span. Twenty years of research have produced a rich repertoire of algorithms and software for simulating protein sequence evolution. However, current models do not capture the processes by which multidomain proteins evolve. Multidomain proteins are mosaics of sequence fragments that encode protein modules: structural or functional units called domains. Because of their modular nature, multidomain proteins play central roles in cellular communication with other cells and with the environment. In human health, multidomain families are implicated in tissue repair, apoptosis, inflammation response, and innate immunity. Since roughly 30% of bacterial proteins and 50% of vertebrate proteins contain two or more domains, the critical benefits of simulation currently cannot be exploited for at least a third of all proteins on this planet.<br/><br/>This project addresses this gap through the design and implementation of software for simulating multidomain evolution. This project advances research infrastructure through the development and distribution of the first evolutionary simulator for multidomain proteins. This project also contributes to building a broadly inclusive scientific work force through research experiences for undergraduates and classroom teaching. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited from women in Carnegie Mellon's undergraduate program and from groups that are underrepresented in STEM through educational activities at the University of Puerto Rico. Simulation is an essential technique in molecular evolution, where the processes of interest typically act on the time scales that are beyond the reach of human endeavor. Simulation is essential for comparison and validation of evolutionary algorithms and software, for evaluating competing hypotheses, and for assessing how a system will respond to perturbations. Despite the growth of sophisticated methodology for simulating the evolution of amino acid sequences, no simulators currently exist that model the process of domain insertion, duplication, and deletion by which multidomain protein families evolve. Although these processes have the potential to generate any combination of domains, only a tiny fraction of possible domain combinations are observed in nature, suggesting that domain order and co-occurrence are stringently constrained. The goal of this project is the development of algorithms and prototype software for multidomain simulation based on realistic models of these constraints. This simulator benefits from a novel combination of Markov chain Monte Carlo technology and data-driven estimates of event probabilities. The data-driven event module enables quick and easy redeployment of the simulator for use in different taxonomic and protein function contexts. Repeated cycles of empirical testing and simulator redesign will promote better understanding of nature's protein design principles, more precise models and methods, and more accurate evolutionary inferences. The resulting software will be available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/_durand/Lab/multidomain.html.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This sequence produced six strong earthquakes over a period of five months as response and recovery operations were underway.  This rapidly evolving seismic crisis underscores the pressing need to better understand how earthquake sequences unfold. The goal of this joint project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the U.S. and the National Environmental Research Council in the U.K., in coordination with the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Volcanologia in Italy, will deepen knowledge of earthquake interaction by studying  these devastating earthquakes. An international team of earthquake expertss will use high-quality seismic data recorded during the sequences to  develop new approaches that can address current obstacles that not only impede deep understanding of the earthquake processes, but also delay the scientific response in the post-earthquake disaster environment. The observational capability to detect, locate and characterize even the smallest magnitude events within few hours developed in this project will be directly applicable to tectonic, induced, geothermal and volcanic seismicity in the U.S. and around the world. Findings of this research will enable improved and scientifically-informed response to the next earthquake crisis to strike the U.S. through existing partnership with the U. S. Geological Survey and support international collaboration amongst US and European earthquake researchers.<br/><br/>This study investigates the physics of complex earthquake sequences through the analysis of high-resolution earthquake catalogs to test increasingly sophisticated earthquake forecasting models.  To reach this goal this project will: 1) Use state-of-the-art techniques to develop a comprehensive high-resolution earthquake catalog for the devastating earthquake sequence that struck the Italian Apennines in 2016-2017; 2) Investigate the physics of earthquake triggering and the evolution of large-magnitude events within this sequence; 3) Develop and provide testable forecast models that can support decision-making process for future earthquake sequences. The reseach will use the unparalleled seismic data set recorded by more than 85 high-quality broadband sensors deployed in the epicentral region to analyze how each earthquake in the sequence contributes to the evolution of seismicity in space and time.  This sequence is particularly rich in this regard, with spatially intertwined episodes on August 24, 2016, October 26-28, 2016 and January 18, 2017. The seismograms of both large and small events will enable us to develop and test new full-waveform based algorithms for event detection, location and characterization that will yield precise source parameters and faulting mechanisms for even the smallest magnitude events. By improving the quality of seismic source parameters across the magnitude spectrum it will be possible to apply process-based models of earthquake nucleation and interaction, including the role of fault complexity, fault loading, relaxation, stress interaction, and fault susceptibility to stress perturbation to understand the evolution of this sequence. The improved fault mechanical understanding will help to develop innovative physics-based forecast models. Currently, real-time earthquake forecasts that describe short-term clustering probabilities are based predominantly on statistical/empirical models. However, these models lack an underlying physical model and therefore have limited predictability if no precursory seismicity exists. A common challenge for both physics- based and statistical forecasts that are based on routine catalogues is the low-probability and high-uncertainty nature of the resulting probabilities. Decision-making and scientific advice are all severely hampered under these conditions. Thus, using this new state-of the art earthquake catalog of the 2016-2017 Italian sequence to test physical, statistical and hybrid (physical and statistical) forecasts in space and time will help (a) to test physical models for earthquake occurrences in sequences, and (b) improve the resolution, accuracy and skill of the forecasts. The broader impacts of this project include improvement on seismic risk assessment as well as fostering collaboration between US and European seismologists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers do not yet fully understand exactly what physical mechanisms cause the first sparks of a lightning flash and how those sparks transform the non-conducting air into the highly conductive lightning channel.  This study will analyze several months of lightning data to gain new understanding of initiation processes.  This project combines an unusual suite of traditional and state-of-the-art research sensors to advance the understanding of lightning initiation.  This research has strong societal impact through potentially improved understanding of lighting initiation and improved lightning warning systems.  <br/><br/>This research seeks to analyze lightning data collected in northern Mississippi during summer 2016 to study cloud discharge events that lead to lightning initiation.

The novelty, and potentially transformative aspect of this new research, is in the new data, which includes measurements from an electric field derivative sensor and a very high frequency (VHF) sensor.  The VHF sensor is particularly suitable for studying the lightning initiating events, because although not well understood, electrical discharges in air are known to produce HF and VHF radiation. The analysis will take into consideration the recent discovery of fast positive breakdown and will investigate how fast positive breakdown is connected to the events that follow.

Because of their high demand, over 500 tons of engineered silver nanoparticles are produced globally. While the properties of these nanoparticles are important for their antibacterial activity, some may also influence toxicity. The environmental impacts of silver nanoparticles independent of their ion leaching are challenging at best. Studies designed to evaluate the nanoparticle-specific effects of silver nanoparticles have been limited because of their propensity to undergo ionic dissolution. Furthermore, discrepancies over the relative contribution of ion to particle toxicity remain prevalent in the literature primarily due to differences in study design. Consequently, there is a great need to understand how silver nanoparticles with diverse characteristics impacts the interaction with organisms by controlling for the confounding effects of ionic contribution to toxicity as compared to particle effects. The researcher's proposed studies will contribute to the scientific understanding of how the properties of these nanoparticles play a role in biouptake, nanoparticle-biological interactions, and ecotoxicity. The research will involve the elimination of the effects of particle surface oxidation and ionic dissolution, which has complicated toxicity studies in the past. This contribution is significant because it will improve our ability to identify features of silver nanoparticles that make them eco-disruptive and predict how these features lead to adverse environmental outcomes. All data will be shared through the open-source knowledge base of Nanomaterial-Biological Interactions (NBI) globally for modeling efforts and will support the development of safety protocols, exposure guidelines, and regulations that protect human and ecosystem health. Furthermore, this research will provide design rules for the assembly of new classes of silver nanoparticles that could be commercialized without concern regarding rapid particle degradation and release into the environment. In addition, this project is designed to incorporate students from diverse backgrounds and will help build future science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) talent. <br/><br/>The researcher's overall aim is to improve our understanding of the specific physiochemical features that dictate nanoparticle-biological interactions. First, they will design a series of lipid-coated silver nanoparticles that are differentially shielded from ion dissolution. Differentially shielded silver nanoparticles will be prepared by encapsulating silver nanoparticles of varying size and shape with a hybrid lipid-membrane to protect the surface from oxidation and ionic dissolution. Changes in the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), thermal electron microscope (TEM), and (Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) will be employed to monitor silver ion dissolution from the suite of nanoparticles. Second, they will identify features of lipid-coated nanoparticles that lead to particle instability. The agglomeration kinetics of the hybrid lipid-coated silver nanoparticles will be assessed using dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Third, since the goal is to ultimately relate these material features with nanoparticle-biological interactions, the researchers will determine the uptake and toxicity of the silver nanoparticle suite. Based on preliminary investigations, the hybrid lipid-coated silver nanoparticles with a robust coating should elicit minimal toxicity and a decrease in surface coverage should lead to a respective increase in toxicity. A well-established embryonic zebrafish assay will be used to identify vertebrate morbidity and mortality resulting from exposure and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) will be used to visualize nanoparticle uptake in whole animals. Finally, the researchers will assess the potential ecotoxicity of the suite using a novel nanocosm assay. Hyperspectral imaging will be used to visualize nanoparticle biodistribution among bacteria, algae, crustaceans, and fish in the small-scale freshwater assay. Collectively, the use of well-characterized silver nanoparticles tuned for ion release will allow the PIs to tease apart the relative contribution of the nanoparticle and ion to biouptake, toxicity, and potential for environmental impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In comparison to animal systems, there is limited mechanistic insight into how plants modulate cell division and specialization with respect to cell polarity. Cell polarity is defined as asymmetry in any aspect of development or physiology along a single axis and asymmetric protein localization is a frequent attribute of polarized cells. Previously a set of receptor kinases was identified that display polar localization in various cell types and have roles in development. These proteins provide a novel set of conceptual and molecular tools to investigate cell polarity in plants. The goals of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to study the links between cell polarity and development and to integrate active research modules designed to improve engagement and retention of undergraduate students in biology. These modules will be conducted in a laboratory course in which students will engage in authentic research and generate materials that will be directly integrated into the research project. This highly interactive course will establish a scientific community that includes peers, graduate students, and faculty. Building a sense of community and contribution to something larger are essential elements in the cultivation of scientific passion and expertise in today's students.<br/><br/>Beyond those proteins involved in transport, very few plant proteins with polar localization have been characterized. A group of transmembrane receptor kinases, POLARLY LOCALIZED KINASEs (PLKs), are localized to the lateral (inner/outer) plasma membrane domains of various root cell types and have roles in organ patterning. It is hypothesized that PLKs directly influence cell division and differentiation in root development through their function in directional signaling. To identify mechanistic links between lateral cell polarity and tissue patterning this CAREER project aims to: 1) characterize the developmental roles of PLKs, 2) elucidate the cellular mechanics of PLK polar localization, and 3) dissect PLK functional and localization domains to identify polarity motifs. This project is poised to address how plant cell polarity is established and maintained from a perspective distinct from directional transport, and which, supports the long standing hypothesis that directional signaling and positional information are key drivers of plant development. The short-term broader impacts of this project will be the acquisition and dissemination of basic information and the recruitment and training of STEM students. Students will receive training in genetic and molecular approaches and cutting-edge microscopy techniques; planning and execution of projects; and, effective scientific communication to establish themselves as scholars and mentors. In the long term, the acquired knowledge can serve as a foundation to selectively exploit existing or generate improved root traits that maximize root function and support plant productivity. In addition, this study may reveal parallels to cell polarity mechanisms in animal systems, providing a framework to identify a common logic to polarity and development across multicellular eukaryotes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They will engage in the real work of what it takes to listen, understand, dream, argue, and create a different way of assessing community collective impact efforts to increase participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>This conference will not only advance knowledge and understanding of community-engaged assessment that supports collective impact but aims to re-conceptualize how assessment in collaborative change initiatives is methodologically constructed: 1) incorporating well qualified and diverse experts (from NSF INCLUDES and beyond) who will facilitate and participate; 2) engaging experts as well as practitioners in design sessions to ideate on ""wicked problems"" in community-engaged assessment; 3) capturing the ideas, insights, and learnings of the convening in a myriad of ways to be shared across the nation; and 4) leveraging the networks created during the conference to continue the shared learning and work. The results of this convening will support the designing and doing of collaborative change work as well as the development of tools and resources that measure effectiveness of these initiatives. These processes will move this work beyond typical evaluation to an assessment system that engages the broader and deeper community. Publications (both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed) will create artifacts, including two books written by conference participants, that describe the process so as to encourage and support others to produce coherent and clear visions for implementation and evaluation of complicated collaborative change interventions to increase STEM representation. The results will be especially beneficial to the INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One particularly widely applied system compares the ratio of 26Al to 10Be in samples that have been exposed at the surface of the earth and then buried.  To create ages from a measured ratio of 26Al/10Be, researchers need to know the ratio of 26Al/10Be after exposure but before burial.  While this ratio has been estimated before, its value is not well known and appears to vary around the world. This project will be the first to measure the 26Al/10Be ratio in over 150 different samples that have already been collected and will thus provide the information needed for many researchers in a variety of fields (geology, glaciology, archeology) to generate more accurate 26Al/10Be burial ages. The new data will also allow much better understanding of the uncertainty of these ages. This work will train a graduate student in science and will improve dates of ancient human remains as well as past changes in Earth's climate, including the coming and going of glaciers.<br/><br/>Knowing the surface production ratio of 26Al/10Be is critical for the calculation of two-isotope burial ages because a measured 26Al/10Be ratio less than the production ratio can be interpreted quantitatively as the duration of burial after surface exposure of a sample. Although 26Al/10Be dating has been widely applied (and many of the applications have been supported by NSF), the 26Al/10Be ratio at production is not well constrained by data. Recent measurements suggest that the ratio is at least 8% higher in Greenland than the canonical value of 6.75, which is derived primarily from one series of early 1990s measurements made at high elevation in the mid latitudes. Physics-based models and some other new data suggest that the 26Al/10Be surface production ratio should vary systematically with latitude and altitude. Here, this project will test for spatial variance and determine the 26Al/10Be surface production ratio empirically as a function of latitude (5-45 in both hemispheres) and altitude (0 to 5000 meters above sea level.). The team will do this by making 150 high-precision 26Al analyses of archived samples already prepared and previously analyzed for 10Be. The team will compare this data-driven determination of the 26Al/10Be surface production ratio with predictions made using numerical models of nuclide production. The project will increase the broader impact of this work by disseminating the results both at meetings and in at least one peer-reviewed publication. This will ensure that the community is aware of and can easily use the data that are generated to improve the accuracy of 26Al/10Be two-isotope dating. Additional broader impacts include training a student who will do much of the research and writing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. This site stimulates undergraduate students' interest in social network analysis (SNA) and behavioral health with a focus on minority health disparities. Participants undergo an extensive methodological training in SNA by the project PI while gaining exposure to a range of research topics and potential science research fields. In conjunction with the Research, Evaluation, and Analysis for Community Health (REACH) Lab and the Minority Health Disparities Initiative (MHDI), they join a collaborative community of transdisciplinary researchers tackling minority health disparities in Nebraska. The expansion the existing REU to Minority Health Disparities is critical for providing students diverse experiences during the summer and expanding the number of students interested in minority health research through innovative methods like social network analysis and culturally sensitive paradigms, such as Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR). The summer program includes training in professionalism and provides individual career mentoring and cohort activities. Building off of existing recruitment strategies employed by UNL's Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program, the project recruits undergraduates from a wide-range of backgrounds, home institutions, ages, genders, and ethnicities, with emphasis on under-represented minority students in the Midwest. Participants are encouraged to pursue careers in social and behavioral health sciences and have opportunities to present the results of their research to both other REU participants and to a wider audience of faculty and staff at the annual Summer Research Symposium that is hosted by Graduate Studies.<br/><br/>Since the late 1990s, a combined focus on social networks and health has had a significant impact on both health research and social science. SNA has emerged as a key analytical lens for sociologists, pushing relational sociology forward at a rapid pace in the last two decades. It has also emerged as a set of general purpose tools and approaches which cross-cut a range of sciences. Without exaggeration, researchers working on networks choose freely among techniques and measures developed from fields as distant as computer security, virology, primatology, and studies of the world-wide-web. Social science and social network analysis have much to contribute in such a transdiciplinary realm. SNA is among the oldest and most rigorous approaches to network analysis, and one with a rich empirical base. While physicists model human networks as metaphors of more basic physical material, SNA researchers have traditionally sought to draw their abstractions from the actual interaction of human beings. The potential of this approach to influence public health and related fields is already apparent. What is needed now is less borrowing, and more researchers trained across newly interwoven fields. In this program, REU participants learn basic approaches to network SNA and then employ these skills in a range of sponsoring NIH- and NSF-funded research projects that focus on minority health and health disparities. Network training takes place in a 2-week intensive network science practicum, followed by 8 weeks of participation in a REACH/MHDI-affiliated research project. These projects are united by a collective focus on fundamental questions related both to minority health and to broadening participation in minority health, and are currently funded by a range of federal and state sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their primary role in the long-term carbon cycle, we currently have a very limited understanding of their melting behavior at the relevant conditions deep inside the Earth. The carbon hosted in carbonate-bearing rocks is carried into the Earth by subducting oceanic plates, where it is either returned to the surface through volcanism or dragged further down into the deep mantle, depending on the depth of carbonate melting. The melting properties of carbonates thus directly control the long-term component of Earth's carbon cycle. This project is focused on better understanding the details of carbonate melting at extreme pressures and temperatures by combining diverse research techniques using experiments, simulations, and statistical modeling. In addition to improving our fundamental understanding of the deep carbon cycle, this project supports developing both technical and leadership expertise; the project is being led by an early career research scientist who will join the co-investigators in the training of two graduate students in a variety of cutting edge research techniques that are also broadly applicable to future material properties research.<br/><br/>The thermodynamic melting properties of carbonates directly control the long-term component of Earth's carbon cycle, and yet this key area has remained poorly understood as a result of practical challenges forcarbonate melting experiments. These difficulties include decomposition prior to melting at pressures below ~3 GPa, as well as extreme sensitivities of the melting behavior to pressure, temperature, and composition (including water content), which severely complicate analysis of such experiments. The goal of this proposal is to combine multiple experimental and theoretical methods to characterize the thermodynamics of solid and molten alkaline earth carbonates, in the (Ca,Mg,Sr,Ba)CO3 system, which encompasses the dominant Mg-Ca bearing components most relevant to the deep Earth. The team's experimental objectives are to: (1) carry out conductivity-based in situ melt detection experiments up to 25 GPa for each endmember, (2) conduct liquid one-bar density and sound speed measurements to determine how each component affects melt density and compressibility, and (3) perform laser-heated diamond anvil cell measurements to constrain the high pressure-temperature (PT) equations of state of the solidus phases. These are combined with theoretical objectives to: (1) simulate the alkaline earth carbonate system using empirical molecular dynamics to predict high PT properties for both melt and mineral phases and (2) employ Bayesian statistical analysis to obtain a global self-consistent thermodynamic model of the (Ca,Mg,Sr,Ba)CO3 system. The final thermodynamic picture provided by this work represents a major stepping-stone on the path to incorporating carbonate melting into a variety of widely-used thermodynamic databases that underpin our understanding of geologic processes at extreme planetary conditions. Together the five techniques employed in this work, which rely on the cooperation and distinct expertise of the three principal investigators, will provide a comprehensive thermodynamic view of carbonate melting at deep mantle conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sustained heat transport through the mantle is crucial for the existence and stability of the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth's mantle dynamics depends on the rate of heat transfer by convection, conduction, and radiation, and understanding these processes requires knowledge on the conductive and radiative parts of thermal conductivity. The investigators will conduct measurements of the conductive and radiative parts of thermal conductivity at extreme conditions of pressure and temperature that are relevant for the Earth's deep interior. The laser techniques developed in this work will advance other fields, which benefit from knowledge of thermal conductivity under extremes, for example various energy applications. A range of students, including area high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates, will benefit from high-quality scientific training at Carnegie that will be provided by participation in the cutting-edge science that will be developed in the course of this work.<br/> <br/>The investigators will determine the thermal conductivity of the Earth's key minerals under high pressure and high temperature conditions (up to 150 GPa and 6000 K) by using pump-probe pulsed laser techniques. To determine the lattice thermal conductivity, they will measure the heat flux histories across the sample using time- and spatially- resolved spectroradiometry and/or time-domain thermoreflectance. To infer the radiative thermal conductivity, the team will study the optical spectra of these mantle minerals in the ultraviolet-to-infrared spectral range. They will apply the time-resolved emission and optical broad band spectroscopy tools that they have previously developed including pulsed white laser (supercontinuum) in combination with time-resolved multichannel detectors (streak camera and intensified CCD). The experiments will be performed on Fe and Fe-rich alloys, high-quality geologically relevant samples pre-synthesized at high P-T condition in large-volume devices (e.g. single crystals of bridgmanite), silicate and oxide melts, and planetary ices. These high P-T experimental data will enable a direct estimate of the radiative and conduction parts of the thermal conductivity of the Earth's mantle and core. These measurements will elucidate complex laws which govern thermal conductivity in the deep interior and reach sufficient accuracy to critically improve existing planetary models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern humans wean their young much earlier on average than the great apes, but the evolutionary origins of this uniquely human pattern are not well understood. This interdisciplinary research project will study behavioral, ecological, physiological, and developmental data for three different wild great ape species, to understand sources of weaning variation in a comparative primate framework. The project will generate a more comprehensive understanding of the biological, ecological and social correlates of weaning variation in our closest living relatives using approaches that are translatable to paleontological contexts, thus contributing to a framework for understanding the evolution of weaning in humans.  This project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in science through structured internships, mentoring and other enhanced training opportunities for students and early career scientists. Research infrastructure will be enhanced by establishing new collaborations and interdisciplinary datasets relevant to many questions at the intersection of primate conservation and human evolutionary biology.  Results of this work will advance our understanding of the population dynamics and health of these critically endangered apes, and will be communicated to wildlife veterinarians and park managers to inform conservation strategies, as well as through online and other public venues.<br/><br/>The timing of weaning represents a balance of maternal and offspring evolutionary interests, and is sensitive to physiological constraints as well as physical and social environments. However, behavioral observations of living primates cannot distinguish nutritive versus social functions of nursing, and methods for reconstructing weaning in paleontological contexts are limited in their ability to discriminate weaning variation among closely-related taxa. This comparative and multi-proxy study of weaning variation in wild great apes focuses on three ecologically-distinct populations that show pronounced variation in suckling behavior and maternal reproductive strategies: Virunga and Bwindi mountain gorillas, which differ markedly in ecology, and Gombe chimpanzees, which provide an important taxonomic contrast. This project integrates suckling and feeding behavior, physical development, and fecal stable isotope data collected from individuals in life, with chemical characterization of their foods, and morphological and dental trace element analyses of associated skeletons from these populations after death. This research investigates (1) what factors influence variability in weaning-related dietary transitions across living wild chimpanzees and gorillas, (2) how chemical proxies in biological tissues (fecal, dental) relate to behavioral and anatomical proxies of weaning, and (3) how reliably dental trace elements record variability in documented dietary histories at the individual and population levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to model large systems at the electronic level is essential for the industrial and technological design of molecules and materials for clean energy, efficient batteries, and novel data storage devices. However, it is challenging to investigate large systems with the most accurate electronic structure methods, since computational cost grows exponentially with system size. Dr. Huang and his group are developing new quantum mechanical embedding methods for determining the electronic properties of large systems in a divide-and-conquer manner. The methods are focused on accurately describing the microscopic interactions among electrons---their quantum correlations---at scale. Finding new ways to address this ""electron correlation problem"" is regarded as one of the grand challenges of 21st century science. Dr. Huang's new algorithms and methods will be implemented in state-of-the-art, open source quantum chemistry codes and made available to the broader research community. Integrated with his research, Dr. Huang is training a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students from engineering, chemistry, physics, and materials science to effectively utilize electronic structure methods, through a new problems-based density functional theory (DFT) course. The course lectures and YouTube tutorials are aimed at lowering the barrier for students to integrate DFT simulations within their research. Working with outreach programs at FSU, Dr. Huang is involving middle school and high school students in his research to increase their interest in pursuing STEM careers.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop new quantum mechanical embedding methods to obtain accurate reaction energies and electronic structures that scale to large chemical systems. The basic idea of embedding methods is to utilize a high-level electronic structure method within a region of interest, and to treat the rest of the system (""the environment"") with a low-level, computationally-efficient method. Dr. Huang and his group are extending embedding methods in three new directions: (i) generalizing density-matrix embedding to metallic systems using a pseudopotential-like approach; (ii) extending the XCPP (exchange-correlation potential patching) methodology to construct RPA (random phase approximation) correlation energies and potentials in large systems in an atom-by-atom manner; and (iii) accelerating the convergence of RPA energy differences calculated with a stochastic sampling scheme by imposing appropriate moment constraints. The new techniques are being applied to challenging problems of significant fundamental and technological interest, including investigating the role of metallic copper in methanol synthesis; charge transfer and magnetic coupling at YBa2Cu3O7/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (superconducting/ferromagnetic) interface; and transport, storage, and release of oxygen in ceria for heterogeneous catalysis. The methodologies are being implemented as open source code in the ABINIT, Psi4, and CP2K quantum chemistry packages.

This process starts at the seaward boundary of the river discharge (plume) and it affects circulation and flow near the river mouth and throughout the adjacent coastal region.  Although the area where this river-ocean interface occurs represents a small region of the ocean, it is very important to ocean mixing and is often poorly resolved in circulation models used to predict environmental conditions in coastal regions. As part of this investigation the researchers will carry out field measurements and utilize numerical models to define variability in the structure of the seaward boundary of the freshwater discharge, and the mixing that occurs there.  These processes will be examined for different river discharge and tidal conditions.  In addition, this study will assess how much of an ebbing riverine outflow is cycled through the seaward boundary and evaluate the overall importance of this region to mixing the total river discharge to a near-ocean salinity.  The outcomes from this work will reveal the details of the physical processes taking place at the riverine-ocean interface and improve the predictive capabilities of large-scale models.  In addition, the advances gained from this study will ultimately allow better prediction of the fate and transport of pollutants, nutrients and water masses in the ocean. During the period of this project three graduate student will supported contributing to building scientific capacity.<br/><br/>The frontal region of a river plume is the seaward boundary that separates a buoyant coastal discharge from ambient ocean water.  Oceanic fronts of all scales act as significant energy sinks over several orders of magnitude through mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Although significant efforts have advanced knowledge of plume dynamics over the last several decades, fundamental gaps still exist in our understanding of frontal evolution, and the role of the front in establishing the dynamics in the interior of the plume and in the overall plume mixing budget. The objective of this proposal is to understand the evolution and significance of frontal processes across a range of scales, from small scale propagating discharge fronts to intermediate scale shelf fronts bounding an ebb pulse, and to identify the mechanisms controlling the evolution of a front from engineering scales to geostrophic scales. Our hypothesis is that the relative importance of frontal mixing to overall mixing in the plume is controlled by the ratio of a frontal length scale representing water mass interaction with the front, to the overall plume length scale, and diminishes as the plume front evolves, due to diminishing connectivity between the plume front and the source through the ebb tide.  We hypothesize that mechanisms of diminishing connectivity include both weakening of barotropic gradients through the plume as well as Coriolis effects as the plume becomes geostrophic.  This work will be pursued using 21st century current, hydrography and microstructure measurements in the plume front and core to assess mixing using various techniques, as well as hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic realistic and idealized numerical models.  The field effort is focused on the mid-sized Merrimack and Connecticut rivers, which are well studied and provide an ideal setting to observe frontal evolution in regions with and without strong tidal currents.  Results from the field study will allow calibration and validation of models, which can then be used to understand similar frontal processes across a wide swath of parameter space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These opportunities include three annual regional conferences, eighteen regional networking workshops, six mathematical and summer institutes, and research experiences for Noyce Scholars and Fellows.  The states in the western region are California, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Wyoming, and Montana.  <br/><br/>This project intends to support nine institutions to provide the coordinated professional development over three years.  These institutions are San Francisco State University (as the lead), California Polytechnic State University, California State University-Fresno, Northern Arizona University, San Diego State University, the University of Arizona, the University of Portland, the University of Texas at Arlington, the University of Wyoming.  Over the three-year project, WRNA conferences are expected to serve about 950 Noyce participants.  In addition, the project intends to reach 150 Noyce teachers through summer institutes and 1,200 participants through regional networking workshops, and to engage nine additional Noyce participants in immersive summer research.  The WRNA is expected to help increase the number of future STEM leaders in the region's high-need school districts who are well-prepared to effectively implement the Next Generation Science Standards and/or the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics, as more Western Region states fully adopt or include similar standards in their STEM curricula.  Noyce leaders will have more opportunities to gain a better understanding of Noyce evaluation and research efforts both nationally and locally.  Noyce projects that have had years of success will mentor and support newer projects.  This effort may help sustain Noyce influence at each of the western region campuses over time and beyond the lifetime of the award.  Supporting the continued growth of Noyce teachers as outstanding STEM professionals is expected to assist in their persistence as classroom teachers and instructional leaders.  The indirect impact of WRNA is expected to be that hundreds of thousands of students in high-need school districts will receive a high-quality STEM education from teachers who are well-trained in new and exciting directions in STEM education.  Moreover, the findings from the robust project evaluation conducted by the American Institute of Research (AIR), along with an individual educational researcher, has the potential to assist other STEM educators to provide effective professional growth opportunities, in support of retaining outstanding teachers in the teaching profession, particularly in those serving in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins provide the main building material of cells and multicellular organisms. In addition, protein enzymes are working horses of the cell catalyzing all chemical reactions required for life. All energy of life is produced and stored by moving electrons in protons across the cellular membrane, a function performed by membrane-bound proteins. At the same time, 80% of the cell's volume is water, which mostly exists in its interfacial form surrounding proteins and lipids of membranes. How proteins and interfacial water, the ""matrix of life"", couple in their function is still largely a mystery requiring both theoretical and experimental studies. The set of questions, addressed by this project, touches on the deepest problems of energy efficiency of life, its physiological energy flow, and the fundamental principles of work produced by non-equilibrium molecular systems.   Professor Matyushov and his research group are actively engaged in an outreach, research and education program involving local high school students. <br/><br/><br/>This theoretical project, which is deeply connected to experimental studies, suggests that proteins are fundamentally non-equilibrium systems in which the time-scales of protein function are often shorter than the time-scales of equilibration achieved through conformational dynamics. This non-equilibrium nature of proteins requires two temperatures: the configurational temperature of the non-equilibrium protein and the standard thermodynamic temperature of the surrounding bath.  Computational studies performed in the previous funding cycle have shown that proteins are up to three times ""hotter""than water. A direct consequence of this perspective is a strong depression of the reaction activation barrier. The catalytic action of the enzyme is very much a function of its non-equilibrium state, which ages to the ?dead state? of the Gibbs distribution due to conformational dynamics exploring the configuration space. The aging process has to be terminated and the enzyme reset before this equilibrium state is reached.  The project connects enzymatic efficiency of redox active proteins with the protein-water interfacial structure and glassy aging dynamics of collective variables linked to the activated barrier crossing.   <br/><br/><br/>The project addresses the following practical questions: (a) Configurational temperature of redox proteins and the dynamics of equilibration with the thermal bath. (b) Theories and simulations of interfacial susceptibility of water and its distinction from water in the bulk. This problem connects to a number of experimental techniques such as depolarized light scattering, THz absorption, dielectric spectroscopy, and protein dielectrophoresis. (c) A theory of non-linear dielectric response of solutions applied to testing of interfaces. Collaborative initiatives as a part of the project aim at linking theory to experiment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will also help us to better understand the variety of conditions under which earthquakes can occur. This work will provide new constraints on the possible mechanisms of such earthquakes by studying the properties of a unique cluster of earthquakes that occur beneath northwestern South America. This project benefits society because of its focus on earthquake occurrence and hazard and because it enhances STEM education by training a postdoctoral fellow in seismology. <br/><br/>The Cauca cluster of intermediate-depth earthquakes, which is located beneath Colombia between at depths of 50-200 kilometers, has ~58 earthquakes per year with local magnitude ML greater than or equal to 2.5. The earthquakes are located both in a planar seismic zone in the subducting slab and in two distinct columns, or fingers, extending 30-40 kilometers normal to and above the slab and into the mantle wedge.  Using seismic data from 2010 to the present from the Colombian National Seismic Network, the Cauca cluster earthquakes will be characterized by precisely relocating the earthquakes, inverting waveforms to calculate focal mechanisms for many of the larger earthquakes, and estimating static and dynamic source properties for the earthquakes.  These analyses will provide the first-ever characterization of mantle wedge earthquakes and a comparison of the source properties of earthquakes in two settings, thus enabling the testing of different hypotheses --- such as dehydration embrittlement, shear instability, hydrofracture, and collapse of fluid propagation pathways --- for why these earthquakes occur.

Increasing the diversity of perspectives in the nation's pool of computer science graduates is strategically important to the nation's prosperity and welfare. Engagement of underrepresented female and minority students in the computer science workforce is needed to help eliminate implicit bias in the systems developed.  A lack of role models and mentors, failure to connect with other students and faculty, and low use of campus resources pose challenges for students who are the first in their families to pursue higher education. Difficulty with the transition to large, impersonal, rigorous courses and financial stress pose added challenges. UTSA is the largest minority-serving institution in South Texas and has a large first-generation enrollment. The project will investigate the integration of evidence-based and experience-based activities over multiple years, taking into account the needs of the individual participants.  <br/><br/>The goal of this S-STEM Track 2 project is to increase the number of high-achieving, low-income students majoring in computer science at the University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA) who join the workforce or pursue advanced studies in computer science.

Through research-based and experience-based, student-centered educational activities, UTSA aims to increase the retention of students majoring in computer science from 70% to 90%. It also aims to improve the student graduation rate from 60% to 80%. Personalized faculty and peer mentoring, individual tutoring, a week-long orientation ""jump start"" program, biweekly group meetings, conference attendance, and involvement in research projects will complement other high-impact practices to support student engagement and success. The progress of each student will be tracked. Individualized, early interventions will be initiated to keep all scholars on track to complete their degrees and proceed to the technical workforce or pursue advanced studies in computer science. Scholars will be encouraged to participate in recruiting and outreach events to share their own stories and provide role models for others.

These montane forests depend on water from winter snow and summer rain. This water is provided by different climate systems. The North American Monsoon climate system occurs each year across the southwestern US. It delivers summer rain through near-daily thunderstorms that move northward from the Gulf of California. Winter snow comes from longer-term storms that originate above the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California and move eastward. Water from these different climate systems have different chemistry and timing. Using tree rings this research project will provide insights into how forest growth and water use has responded to past climate variation and how variation in one part of the season (e.g., winter or summer) influences forest growth and water use in the following seasons. This region has experienced reduced snow packs, warmer winter temperatures and an increase in droughts. Therefore, it is important to understand how the change in water availability is affecting the growth of these forests. An understanding of how drought controls forest growth is crucial to not only predicting natural resource production, but also predicting and controlling forest fire frequencies. The research will contribute to an exhibit entitled: 'The Fingerprints of Forest Responses to Climate Variation', in The Laboratory of Tree Ring Research and at the Biosphere 2 campus at the University of Arizona. The research will include the training of two post-doctoral fellows and numerous undergraduate students, with an emphasis on recruitment from the large Hispanic and Native American student populations at the University of Arizona. <br/><br/>This research will explore whether variation in the amount of summer or winter precipitation over the past fifty years, in any given year, is negatively correlated with the amount of precipitation during the previous winter or the following summer, respectively, and whether those correlated influences have affected forest wood production and water-cycling in predictable ways. Researchers will examine how trees mobilize stored sugar resources to sustain wood production and water cycling during years with extremely low winter or summer rainfall, and the degree to which the use of stored sugars differentially buffers the effects of extreme winter or summer drought.  This project will design a new generation of mathematical models to better predict how variation in winter versus summer precipitation influences forest wood production and water use, and whether there are limits to sustaining wood production following multi-year droughts. The research will utilize advanced techniques in the analysis of stable isotopes in the cellulose extracted from individual tree-rings. A major part of the studies will focus on tree rings produced during the 1960's and 1970's, when atomic bomb testing produced an atmospheric spike of radioactive 14C that was subsequently incorporated into trees. The 14C provides a detectable tracer that facilitates determination of the age of stored sugars in trees and the utilization of those tagged sugars in the production of tree rings specifically, and timber generally.  New theory will be developed to provide a foundation for understanding and predicting how trees incorporate stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen from the atmosphere into their wood.  All data will be deposited in the International Tree Ring Data Bank, which is administered by the US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and which has been used in numerous multi-national collaborations on understanding how climate controls the health and vigor of forest ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will give intensive training to a diverse group of undergraduate students over the course of a 10 week summer program. The training will allow these students to fill critical needs in ongoing projects, both within and outside academia, and to eventually develop their own projects advancing the national interest. The program will begin with a 2-week full day boot camp to cover basics of the methods to measure brain activity (such as magnetic resonance imaging, MRI), which will be followed by an 8 week placement in a cutting edge research lab. Frequent seminars will provide students with the additional professional skills they need to succeed in their future careers. <br/><br/>Neuroimaging is the most commonly used laboratory tool in in Cognitive Neuroscience, helping to unify the field and drive research progress. Undergraduate training in neuroimaging, however, has lagged because of its high cost and relatively technical nature. This in turn has made it difficult for researchers to identify and recruit students into their Cognitive Neuroscience laboratories that use neuroimaging, while also placing a large training burden upon them. The goal of the proposed program is to overcome the training gap in neuroimaging for cognitive neuroscience. Over the course of a 10-week summer program undergraduate students will gain both detailed knowledge of neuroimaging methods and intensive experience using them in a research project. A 2-week imaging boot camp will give trainees facility with fMRI and EEG imaging modalities.

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. This REU site is designed to increase diversity in the linguistic sciences by investigating the linguistic choices that underrepresented minority students make as they navigate higher education. The research sheds light on the role of language in social mobility, an important but understudied aspect of educational and economic advancement. It therefore supports the prosperity of underrepresented minorities and many findings are likely to generalize to and thus benefit other American populations. The project fosters diversity in the linguistic sciences by involving undergraduates from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), which do not offer linguistics as a major. The findings of the research benefit colleges and universities by providing information about the nature of the language and culture of African-American college students, which has direct implications for teaching and mentoring. In addition, the project makes scholarly contributions to linguistics, sociology, and education. REU participants conduct interviews with African-American students and gather samples of academic writing and social media activity to create a public archive documenting the full range of underrepresented minority students' linguistic practices. In Year 2, REU activities are divided between the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of California, Davis, to take advantage of the fact that the University of California, Davis will host the Linguistic Society of America's biennial Institute in Summer 2019. The project thus begins to create a collaborative community of faculty interested in linguistics across HBCUs and other MSIs in order to build infrastructure across universities.<br/><br/>The primary objective of the REU site is to examine the role of language in social mobility while increasing the diversity of undergraduates engaged in the linguistic sciences. The project is the first to extensively document and analyze the linguistic choices and experiences of African-American English-speaking undergraduates as they navigate higher education. The project creates a free public archive of African-American English by having REU participants document the language of African-Americans on college and university campuses in Southern California. REU participants conduct sociolinguistic interviews with African-American undergraduates and gather samples of their academic writing and social media activity to document the full range of interviewees' linguistic practices. The research answers questions about how African-American English is used and perceived by speakers in academic contexts, which in turn sheds light on the impact of language on the educational attainment and social mobility of African-American students. The primary training objective of the REU is to provide undergraduates from HBCUs and other MSIs with training and experience in the methods of linguistic research as well as in-depth mentoring and professional development in order to support their pursuit of a Ph.D. in linguistics or a related field. Research methods include sociolinguistic interviews, corpus building, statistical analysis of grammatical patterns, instrumental phonetic analysis, and discourse analysis. The REU contributes to linguistics, sociology, and education by shedding light on the role of language in higher education and African-Americans' social mobility. The broader impacts of the project are to provide undergraduates from underrepresented groups with research experience and preparation for graduate school in linguistics and related fields, to benefit colleges and universities by sharing research results and their implications for teaching undergraduate African-American English speakers, and to create a professional network of faculty interested in linguistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process starts at the seaward boundary of the river discharge (plume) and it affects circulation and flow near the river mouth and throughout the adjacent coastal region.  Although the area where this river-ocean interface occurs represents a small region of the ocean, it is very important to ocean mixing and is often poorly resolved in circulation models used to predict environmental conditions in coastal regions. As part of this investigation the researchers will carry out field measurements and utilize numerical models to define variability in the structure of the seaward boundary of the freshwater discharge, and the mixing that occurs there.  These processes will be examined for different river discharge and tidal conditions.  In addition, this study will assess how much of an ebbing riverine outflow is cycled through the seaward boundary and evaluate the overall importance of this region to mixing the total river discharge to a near-ocean salinity.  The outcomes from this work will reveal the details of the physical processes taking place at the riverine-ocean interface and improve the predictive capabilities of large-scale models.  In addition, the advances gained from this study will ultimately allow better prediction of the fate and transport of pollutants, nutrients and water masses in the ocean. During the period of this project three graduate student will supported contributing to building scientific capacity.<br/><br/>The frontal region of a river plume is the seaward boundary that separates a buoyant coastal discharge from ambient ocean water.  Oceanic fronts of all scales act as significant energy sinks over several orders of magnitude through mechanisms that are poorly understood.  Although significant efforts have advanced knowledge of plume dynamics over the last several decades, fundamental gaps still exist in our understanding of frontal evolution, and the role of the front in establishing the dynamics in the interior of the plume and in the overall plume mixing budget. The objective of this proposal is to understand the evolution and significance of frontal processes across a range of scales, from small scale propagating discharge fronts to intermediate scale shelf fronts bounding an ebb pulse, and to identify the mechanisms controlling the evolution of a front from engineering scales to geostrophic scales. Our hypothesis is that the relative importance of frontal mixing to overall mixing in the plume is controlled by the ratio of a frontal length scale representing water mass interaction with the front, to the overall plume length scale, and diminishes as the plume front evolves, due to diminishing connectivity between the plume front and the source through the ebb tide.  We hypothesize that mechanisms of diminishing connectivity include both weakening of barotropic gradients through the plume as well as Coriolis effects as the plume becomes geostrophic.  This work will be pursued using 21st century current, hydrography and microstructure measurements in the plume front and core to assess mixing using various techniques, as well as hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic realistic and idealized numerical models.  The field effort is focused on the mid-sized Merrimack and Connecticut rivers, which are well studied and provide an ideal setting to observe frontal evolution in regions with and without strong tidal currents.  Results from the field study will allow calibration and validation of models, which can then be used to understand similar frontal processes across a wide swath of parameter space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cell type identity is defined, at least in part, by the specific regions of the genome that are transcribed from DNA to RNA.  Transcription is the basic cellular process that creates the RNA intermediate that either codes for proteins, mRNAs, or regulates other processes, producing various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) like enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Both types of transcript cell differentiation paths or cellular responses to environmental influences. RNA polymerases are the enzymes that produce RNA transcripts, such as mRNAs and ncRNAs, and they exist in cells either as molecules that are maintain their association with the DNA template or are released being transported away from the DNA and acted on by other cellular machinery. One complication to analyzing the transcription process is that genes can overlap, so the presence of a polymerase and a nascent RNA transcript might indicate activity of either gene using current methodologies. Since RNA transcripts have a high propensity to fold into three dimensional shapes they that can affect the downstream processes, both sequence and shape of the nascent RNA are important characteristics of nascent transcripts still associated with DNA as well as the RNA transcripts that are released from the DNA. Only recently have high throughput nascent transcription assays become available; these allow researchers to assess the activity of cellular polymerases directly. This project seeks to develop an integrated analysis framework for nascent transcription data.  Critically, changes in the shapes or levels of transcripts provide information as to how mutations, or other perturbations, have affected an RNA polymerase's functional properties.  Understanding the detailed molecular basis of transcription is critical to many research areas including biochemistry, molecular biology and computational biology. As such, careful attention will be paid to the development of educational and computational resources to support of the larger community. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to develop of an integrated framework for the interpretation and analysis of nascent transcription. This project leverages a mathematical model of RNA polymerase II that, when fit to nascent transcription data, quantitatively characterizes not only the levels but also the shapes of all transcripts genome-wide.   Specifically, this project has 4 overarching goals, as follows:  Leverage patterns of differential nascent transcription to identify overlapping transcripts; detection of overlapping transcription at regulatory regions like enhancers may provide insight into how such ncRNAs function. Capture termination of transcription within a principled mathematical model of polymerase behavior; the algorithm developed here will inform on the conflicting hypotheses about how transcription termination occurs. Identify the impact of technical choices, such as protocol selection and sequencing depth, on the detection and characterization of transcripts, thereby recommending best practice in nascent transcription studies. Enable broader adoption of nascent transcription analysis through construction of an educational module that supports the use of these computational tools; the module will encompass the software, websites, and user documentation.  In summary, the research proposed here will provide an unprecedented perspective on differences in transcription characteristics at individual genes and how perturbations affect them.  By quantifying alterations in transcription at individual genes and their magnitude, the end result of this project will be an integrated framework for the interpretation of nascent transcription.

A key ingredient that makes life possible is a vast reservoir of water on the Earth's surface. However, the rocky interior of the Earth plays an important role in sustaining this surface liquid water over geological time scales. Liquid water facilitates weathering of surface rocks and minerals, and in the process, produces minerals such as clays and other hydrous mineral phases that can lock up the liquid water in their crystal structure. These hydrous minerals are the ultimate sinks for storing water at surficial conditions. If the weathering processes were to continue unhindered, all the liquid water on the Earth's surface could be potentially stored in the crystalline hydrous minerals in a time scale of a few billion years. The process of mantle convection in the rocky interior of the Earth helps in circulating this water stored in minerals back to the surface through dehydration and subsequent volcanism. Water at depth plays an important role in reducing the melting temperature of the rocks constituting the mantle. Water also gets incorporated as hydrogen defects in mantle minerals and affects their elastic and transport properties, including rheology and viscosity. This in turn facilitates mantle convection process in the Earth. Owing to the importance of water in the deep Earth processes, it is important to constrain how water is transported in to the Earth's interior and to determine how much water is stored in the rocky interior of the Earth. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award aims to address these fundamental questions by integrating research, training, and mentoring of the next generation of scientists and educators in the STEM fields and by making them aware of the importance of Solid Earth research for society. Undergraduate students through the Florida State University's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) and high school students through the Young Scholar Program (YSP) will be involved in this research. The PI will also reach out to school students from underrepresented school districts, including Leon, Gadsden, Jefferson, and Hamilton counties in Florida and Thomas County in Georgia. The principal investigator (PI) will participate in educational and outreach activities hosted by the Challenger Learning Center. The PI and his team will present the outcomes from this project at international conferences, including the Fall American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting. They will also participate in NSF-sponsored and community-driven workshops and conferences funded by NSF.<br/><br/>The overarching theme of this study will be to explore the high-pressure and temperature physical properties of hydrogen bearing mineral phases. In particular, the PI will use a combination of experiments and theoretical methods to examine the behavior of hydrogen and how it influences- elastic and transport properties such as diffusion and electrical conductivity of minerals at conditions relevant to the Earth's interior. The properties of hydrous minerals will be explored using vibrational spectroscopy, scattering and diffraction methods at both in house and international facilities. High-temperature elasticity of hydrogen bearing minerals will be examined using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy. The experimental findings will be supplemented with first principles simulations. The constraints on elasticity and transport properties will be correlated with geophysical observations to put better constraints on the transport of water into the Earth?s interior and also the size of the water reservoir in the deep Earth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many languages (e.g. English and Japanese), the subject can be identified as the most prominent element in a sentence, according to many grammatical phenomena. However, so-called ergative languages present a puzzle to this relatively stable cross-linguistic picture, since in these languages, the object, rather than the subject, behaves as the most prominent element according to some of those same phenomena. Two broad approaches have been taken in dealing with ergative languages. The first consists in claiming that ergativity is a surface phenomenon; that is, it is not a reflection of deep structural differences between ergative and nonergative languages. The second approach claims that ergative languages are in fact structurally different from nonergative languages, in that the subject is not always the most prominent element in the sentence. Settling this debate will be an important step towards gaining a better understanding of the range of possible variation in the structure of human languages.<br/><br/>An important step in addressing this debate is the close investigation of languages that have been claimed to be ergative, since many of them remain relatively understudied. The present project focuses on one such language: West Circassian, of the Northwest Caucasian family. Based on previous descriptions of the language, the PI and co-PI adopt the second approach described above as their initial hypothesis in accounting for ergativity in this language. In order to test this hypothesis, the co-PI will work with native speakers of West Circassian in the Republic of Adygea, Russia. The data to be collected will primarily comprise recorded conversations with speakers and oral narratives. Whether the hypothesis is confirmed or not, the project will present a valuable contribution to our understanding of the limits of linguistic variation, as well as to our knowledge of currently understudied aspects of West Circassian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program in the Division of Materials Research also contributes to this award. The new methods enable simulations of molecules and condensed matter systems that are very difficult to treat with conventional approaches, for example rare-earth compounds or transition metal compounds used in catalysis.  Such systems are critically importance for science and emerging technologies.  A fundamentally different approach to electronic structure theory based on quantum fluctuations, proposed by Furche promises to overcome many of these limitations. The methods developed in this project are made available to the public through the Turbomole quantum chemistry software. The project enhances undergraduate education and workforce readiness through a new concentration in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry at UCI and a high school outreach program aimed at students from disadvantaged backgrounds.<br/><br/>Furche and his group are developing new methodology to enable predictive simulations of molecules and condensed matter systems such as small-bandgap or correlated materials and clusters, noncovalently bound nanostructures, or optical properties of transition-metal and rare earth compounds. Despite their critical importance for science and emerging technologies, these systems remain nearly intractable with conventional electronic structure methods, due to insufficient accuracy, computational efficiency, or both. Random phase approximation (RPA) methods developed during previous funding periods are the prototype fluctuation-based electronic structure theory. Guided by the successes and failures of RPA, Furche and his group are laying the groundwork for a systematically improvable hierarchy of electronic structure methods based on fluctuations. As opposed to the conventional approach to electron correlation in chemistry, which is based on interacting electron pairs, triples, etc., the methods proposed here describe correlation in many-electron systems by vacuum fluctuations generated by virtual pairs of electrons and holes traveling forward and backward in time (and multiples thereof).  Furche and his group also explore a Brueckner functional framework as alternative to Kohn-Sham reference states, and aim to extend the scope of RPA methods to ionization, time-dependent properties, and excited states. Applications include low-valent rare-earth and actinide compounds, and halogen-pi interaction mediated drug design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How plants can do this without constantly creating bubbles in their hydraulic systems, which act to block the water transport is still not completely understood. Engineers have not been able to replicate water transport under negative pressure, except in very small amounts over very short distances under idealized laboratory conditions.  So how can trees move vast quantities of water through the xylem (wood) in their trunks under negative pressure? The goal of this research is to determine the role of natural oils (lipids) in this process. Lipids have been found covering the surfaces of xylem vessels in plants. The project will determine the composition, locations, origins, and possible functions of lipids in xylem of vascular plants and test the hypothesis that lipids are required for negative pressure transport. The research will increase the understanding of plant adaptation to water stress, and could potentially lead to engineered systems that replicate plant water transport under negative pressure. The research will involve undergraduate students, including from groups currently underrepresented in the sciences, and its broader impacts will include education about plant water transport both in academic courses and public outreach events.<br/><br/>It has been an axiom of the cohesion-tension theory that it is the high surface tension of water that protects xylem conduits against bubble entry. This axiom was recently challenged by findings that xylem sap of flowering plants contains significant amounts of surface-active lipids and that surfactants isolated from xylem sap strongly reduced the sap's surface tension. Moreover, surfactant-coated bubbles were found in sap, suggesting that plants can transport water in the presence of bubbles, rather than needing to prevent their formation completely. This research addresses the questions: 1. Are apoplastic lipids found in xylem of all major groups of vascular plants? 2. What is the composition of apoplastic lipids in different plants? 3. Where in the xylem are apoplastic lipids located? 4. Where do apoplastic xylem lipids originate? The research will use 15 representative species of all major vascular plant lineages using imaging via TEM, confocal super-resolution microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, as well as by lipidomic analyses of xylem sap and xylem tissue using mass spectrometry. The research will test the paradigm-reversing hypothesis that lipid-coatings of gas-water surfaces provide the hydraulic system with a degree of protection against bubbles expanding into embolism and causing hydraulic failure. The proposed research on lipids in water under negative pressure will contribute to scientific knowledge not only in plant biology, but also in physics and chemical engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern humans wean their young much earlier on average than the great apes, but the evolutionary origins of this uniquely human pattern are not well understood. This interdisciplinary research project will study behavioral, ecological, physiological, and developmental data for three different wild great ape species, to understand sources of weaning variation in a comparative primate framework. The project will generate a more comprehensive understanding of the biological, ecological and social correlates of weaning variation in our closest living relatives using approaches that are translatable to paleontological contexts, thus contributing to a framework for understanding the evolution of weaning in humans.  This project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in science through structured internships, mentoring and other enhanced training opportunities for students and early career scientists. Research infrastructure will be enhanced by establishing new collaborations and interdisciplinary datasets relevant to many questions at the intersection of primate conservation and human evolutionary biology.  Results of this work will advance our understanding of the population dynamics and health of these critically endangered apes, and will be communicated to wildlife veterinarians and park managers to inform conservation strategies, as well as through online and other public venues.<br/><br/>The timing of weaning represents a balance of maternal and offspring evolutionary interests, and is sensitive to physiological constraints as well as physical and social environments. However, behavioral observations of living primates cannot distinguish nutritive versus social functions of nursing, and methods for reconstructing weaning in paleontological contexts are limited in their ability to discriminate weaning variation among closely-related taxa. This comparative and multi-proxy study of weaning variation in wild great apes focuses on three ecologically-distinct populations that show pronounced variation in suckling behavior and maternal reproductive strategies: Virunga and Bwindi mountain gorillas, which differ markedly in ecology, and Gombe chimpanzees, which provide an important taxonomic contrast. This project integrates suckling and feeding behavior, physical development, and fecal stable isotope data collected from individuals in life, with chemical characterization of their foods, and morphological and dental trace element analyses of associated skeletons from these populations after death. This research investigates (1) what factors influence variability in weaning-related dietary transitions across living wild chimpanzees and gorillas, (2) how chemical proxies in biological tissues (fecal, dental) relate to behavioral and anatomical proxies of weaning, and (3) how reliably dental trace elements record variability in documented dietary histories at the individual and population levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The event takes place as part of the first day of activities at the 13th International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI 2018), held March 5-8 in Chicago, and which was jointly sponsored by ACM and IEEE.  HRI is the premier conference for showcasing the very best interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research on human-robot interaction, with roots in diverse fields including robotics, artificial intelligence, social psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, human factors, engineering, and many more.  It is a single-track, highly selective annual international conference that invites broad participation.  The theme of HRI 2018 was ""Robots for Social Good.""  The conference sought contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, methodological, behavioral, and theoretical, that advance fundamental and applied knowledge and methods in human-robot interaction, with the goal of enabling human-robot interaction through new technical advances, novel robot designs, new guidelines for design, and advanced methods for understanding and evaluating interaction.  More information about the conference is available online at http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2018.  The Pioneers Workshop was designed to afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities.  This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives.  Participants were encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years.  Participants also gained leadership and service experience, as the workshop was largely student organized and student led.  The PI expressed his strong commitment to recruiting women and members from under-represented groups.  To further ensure diversity the event organizers considered each applicant's potential to offer a fresh perspective and point of view with respect to HRI, and worked to recruit students who are just beginning their graduate degree programs in addition to students who are further along in their degrees.  <br/><br/>The Pioneers Workshops are designed to complement the conference, by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference.  During the workshop, participants talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field.  The formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries is encouraged.  To these ends, the workshop format encompasses a variety of activities including keynotes, a distinguished panel session, and breakout sessions.  To start the day, all workshop attendees briefly introduce themselves and their interests.  Following the opening keynote, approximately half of the participants present 3-minute overviews of their work, leading into an interactive poster session.  This enables all participants to share their research and receive feedback from students and senior researchers in an informal setting.  The workshop organizers facilitate the post-presentation discussion and encourage participants to ask questions of their peers during the interactive break and poster session.  After lunch, the remaining workshop participants give their 3-minute overviews, followed by presentation of their posters during a second interactive poster session.  Senior researchers (in addition to those on the panel) are invited to attend the student presentations and poster sessions in order to provide feedback to participants, and workshop participants are invited to present their posters during the main poster session of the HRI conference as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These simulations and analyses are increasingly constrained by the massive volumes of data that they must use, generate, and analyze.  To manage this enormous amount of data, this project explores innovative mechanisms to optimize the performance of these simulations by reducing data movement and maximizing the use of computing power, while minimizing errors and information loss.  Such performance improvements support NSF's mission to advance emerging, data-intensive science discovery and contribute to solving the world's most pressing and complex contemporary science and engineering problems.  This project implements comprehensive outreach and education to train the next-generation of professional workers and researchers in the latest computing architectures and programming methodologies, and provides rich opportunities for student engagement, research, and employment.  It leverages multiple campus and national resources and implements proven, research-based interventions to attract, retain, and educate female and underrepresented minority populations in computer engineering, which furthers the US national goal of increased participation in engineering. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to adapt techniques and formats for compressing video data to the investigation of novel data encoding and decoding schemes to optimize data movement and computation in data-intensive simulation and analyses.  Innovative new mechanisms have the potential to efficiently reduce the volume of data generated and transferred while also enabling rapid execution of various analysis kernels using compressed data, and permitting seamless scaling of their performance on current and future extreme-scale platforms.  The research objectives are to investigate data encoding/decoding of scientific datasets and harness encoded data, employ and scale encoded datasets seamlessly within current extreme-scale scientific workflows, and optimize machine learning and data mining algorithms with the goal of maximizing the use of computing power while minimizing errors.  These new mechanisms are applied to an evaluation framework and validated on multiple extreme-scale data-driven scientific applications, including climate, multiphysics, and fluid dynamics.  This approach is expected to transform data representation and encoding while incurring minimal disturbance to existing applications, responding to the trends in hardware architecture and dataset characteristics.  It is anticipated to improve the overall performance of computational scientists' workloads by reducing defensive and productive I/O costs, respectively, up to 100x and 200x data reduction spatially and temporally, potentially resulting in up to an overall 50x I/O cost improvement.  The project leverages multiple collaborations in order to establish the governing principles for system co-design and scalable system software layers for better data encoding within world-class computational infrastructures.  This project strengthens the University of Massachusetts Lowell computer engineering curriculum, broadens participation in computer engineering, and creates a collaborative, interdisciplinary research program geared toward exploiting ever-evolving computing paradigms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet the ability to manipulate cellular responses is still quite limited in two key ways. First, researchers have not deciphered the instructions used by cells to adopt a particular response. Second, even if researchers perfectly knew which instructions to provide, they lack the tools to deliver them to a particular cell of interest, at a precise time, without affecting its neighbors. This research will address both of these key challenges by studying a protein, Erk, that plays a fundamental role in organizing cell decisions in all multicellular organisms. This project will rely on a combination of cutting-edge tools: live-cell biosensors to measure natural Erk responses and engineered, light-sensitive proteins to alter Erk activity at precise times and locations in a tissue. This comprehensive understanding of how Erk activity patterns control responses at the cell, tissues, and whole organism scales and how one can alter those patterns to control cell fate. These studies will be integrated with an education plan to train the next generation of quantitative biologists and to foster early exposure to research for historically underrepresented students.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of the researcher's lab is to address two fundamental problems in cellular systems biology. How are a small number of highly conserved signaling pathways repurposed in different cell types and organisms to encode information about the external world? Which features of the signals sent by these pathways are sufficient to specify cell-, tissue-, and organism-level phenotypes?  Fulfilling these two aims will help to bridge the gap from a static genotype to complex multicellular phenotypes and define the computations that are carried out by the groups of proteins that work together to process cellular information. The research plan is focused on an extensively studied signaling pathway, the Erk pathway, which plays essential roles across eukaryotic organisms. Although the individual proteins comprising the pathway have been thoroughly studied by genetic and biochemical approaches, live-cell Erk biosensors have recently revealed exquisite spatiotemporal patterns of activity: oscillations in individual cells, propagating waves across tissues, and a fast succession of spatial patterns during embryogenesis. The work will dissect these ornate patterns using a combination of quantitative measurements and highly controlled optogenetic inputs that can be used to activate Erk signaling in any spatial or temporal pattern. In particular, the research seeks to: (1) dissect the mechanism that generates pulses of Erk activity in a laboratory model of the epidermis; (2) determine how Erk dynamics control gene expression and cell fate in epidermal cells; and (3) unravel how Erk signaling affects tissue morphogenesis in the developing fly embryo, where exquisite signaling patterns appear over time and in 3D space throughout the organism. The research is complemented by an education plan directed at broadening the early-stage research opportunities available to undergraduates, particularly historically underrepresented students, and at disseminating the tools of quantitative biology and optogenetics to the next generation of cell and developmental biology trainees.<br/>The Project is jointly funded by Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and Integrative Organismal Systems, with additional support provided by the Directorate's Rule of Life Venture Fund.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The plumage of birds encompasses a spectacular array of ornamental plumages long appreciated for their beauty, yet we know little about how the color of plumage patches or their size is influenced by genes. It is generally thought that the plumage color of male birds is a signal of quality to females choosing mates. Several hypotheses have now been proposed linking the size and color of plumage ornaments to various physiological and genetic pathways related to health, including those involved in cellular metabolism, growth, oxidative stress and immunity. Any one pathway could provide a general explanation for how bird colors signal quality in males, but these genetic pathways may interact in complex ways that can only be understood using genome-wide analysis techniques. Here the researchers plan to examine these pathways using next generation gene sequencing of the genome of a brightly colored warbler. The types of pigments in this bird (black colored melanin and yellow colored carotenoids) are widespread across species and, thus, will provide a general model for many researchers studying the development of colorful ornaments.  As part of the project the researchers will conduct workshops on genomics at local colleges, at an international behavior meeting and, in Belize, for a local zoo and local conservationists.<br/><br/><br/>This study will use genomic analyses to test several recent hypotheses for the genetic basis of ornament expression in a warbler, the common yellowthroat. This warbler is one of a few species of birds in which females are known to choose mates based on ornamental traits that are associated with indices of fitness. Interestingly, sexual selection targets different ornaments in different populations of the common yellowthroat. In Wisconsin, females prefer males with larger black masks, whereas in New York females prefer males with larger, more colorful yellow bibs. The investigators have already shown that mask size in Wisconsin and bib color in New York are honest signals of similar aspects of male quality in each population. Based on these results, the investigators plan to use a genomics approach to determine if: 1) elaborate ornaments are related to the expression of genes in growth, immunity and oxidative stress pathways, as predicted by recent hypotheses, and 2) if these traits exhibit molecular parallelism where the same genetic pathways are most closely associated with the ornament preferred by females in each location. To maximize the probability of finding differences and to expand the tests of parallelism, the study will also incorporate geographic comparisons with other subspecies and a closely-related species in Belize, which have larger differences in ornament size and color.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significant research effort has been devoted to protecting digital circuits, but the protection of analog circuits from an adversary has largely been ignored.  The focus of this work is to explore techniques to enhance the security of analog circuits from attacks such as reverse engineering and cloning, both of which can lead to IP theft. <br/><br/>Analog parameter obfuscation is proposed as a means to protect analog circuits from adversarial theft. The large design space for analog parameter obfuscation, which includes biasing conditions, gains, bandwidths, noise figure, quality factors, center frequency, phase noise, and many more, provides a means to mask analog circuit functionality beyond the simple binary functional logic locking that has been developed for digital circuits. To enhance the security of analog circuits from reverse engineering, the proposed research includes 1) the development of novel parameter-based obfuscation techniques for analog circuits, 2) the development of algorithms and methodologies to select and prune analog circuit parameters (gain, biasing points, bandwidth, noise figure, quality factor, phase noise, etc.) best suited for obfuscation, 3) the development of initial metrics for the evaluation of parameter obfuscation techniques, and 4) the implementation of the obfuscation technique on a superheterodyne receiver for experimental verification and algorithm refinement.<br/> <br/>The fundamental outcome is to develop a systematic approach to analyze and obfuscate analog circuit parameters that are multi-dimensional and continuous by nature.

Moreover, what does their success tell us about the micro-level workings of state power and its capacities to shape the lives of marginalized groups?  This research studies the significance of street-level bureaucracy, i.e. frontline workers, in negotiating state power, and the inter-relationship of intimate labor with inequities of gender, class, and ethnicity. Findings will show how community health workers negotiate, and often overcome, social and symbolic boundaries in their communities. This has implications for global health. Community health worker programs are critical for the effective delivery of health services in low- and middle-income countries, especially for marginalized populations. By emphasizing the experiences of these workers in negotiating the dynamics of their communities, this research will generate policy recommendations about how to better support community health workers in their role. <br/> <br/>This research will study a) the reasons why women continue to work as community health volunteers; b) the meaning that this work has for them, beyond their formal tasks; and c) how caste affects their experiences with their community on the one hand, and with the health system on the other. The project will conduct a relational ethnography of Dalit, formerly untouchable, and dominant caste community health volunteers in the two districts of Muktsar and Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar in Punjab, India. The North Indian state of Punjab presents a privileged case in terms of overall prosperity and social mobility for Dalits relative to the rest of India. Within Punjab, Muktsar and SBS Nagar are two districts that have similar percentages of Dalits in the population, but differ on key indices of economic mobility, such as literacy. The community health volunteers are pre-dominantly lower caste, working class women. The project expects that while gender and caste act to subsidize the state, the state also provides opportunities for these women to mitigate their marginalization by according them status and access otherwise unavailable to them. Comparing Muktsar and SBS Nagar will allow for a nuanced understanding of caste not as static social identity, but rather as reproduced dynamically in the context of the local political economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This sequence produced six strong earthquakes over a period of five months as response and recovery operations were underway.  This rapidly evolving seismic crisis underscores the pressing need to better understand how earthquake sequences unfold. The goal of this joint project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the U.S. and the National Environmental Research Council in the U.K., in coordination with the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Volcanologia in Italy, will deepen knowledge of earthquake interaction by studying  these devastating earthquakes. An international team of earthquake expertss will use high-quality seismic data recorded during the sequences to  develop new approaches that can address current obstacles that not only impede deep understanding of the earthquake processes, but also delay the scientific response in the post-earthquake disaster environment. The observational capability to detect, locate and characterize even the smallest magnitude events within few hours developed in this project will be directly applicable to tectonic, induced, geothermal and volcanic seismicity in the U.S. and around the world. Findings of this research will enable improved and scientifically-informed response to the next earthquake crisis to strike the U.S. through existing partnership with the U. S. Geological Survey and support international collaboration amongst US and European earthquake researchers.<br/><br/>This study investigates the physics of complex earthquake sequences through the analysis of high-resolution earthquake catalogs to test increasingly sophisticated earthquake forecasting models.  To reach this goal this project will: 1) Use state-of-the-art techniques to develop a comprehensive high-resolution earthquake catalog for the devastating earthquake sequence that struck the Italian Apennines in 2016-2017; 2) Investigate the physics of earthquake triggering and the evolution of large-magnitude events within this sequence; 3) Develop and provide testable forecast models that can support decision-making process for future earthquake sequences. The reseach will use the unparalleled seismic data set recorded by more than 85 high-quality broadband sensors deployed in the epicentral region to analyze how each earthquake in the sequence contributes to the evolution of seismicity in space and time.  This sequence is particularly rich in this regard, with spatially intertwined episodes on August 24, 2016, October 26-28, 2016 and January 18, 2017. The seismograms of both large and small events will enable us to develop and test new full-waveform based algorithms for event detection, location and characterization that will yield precise source parameters and faulting mechanisms for even the smallest magnitude events. By improving the quality of seismic source parameters across the magnitude spectrum it will be possible to apply process-based models of earthquake nucleation and interaction, including the role of fault complexity, fault loading, relaxation, stress interaction, and fault susceptibility to stress perturbation to understand the evolution of this sequence. The improved fault mechanical understanding will help to develop innovative physics-based forecast models. Currently, real-time earthquake forecasts that describe short-term clustering probabilities are based predominantly on statistical/empirical models. However, these models lack an underlying physical model and therefore have limited predictability if no precursory seismicity exists. A common challenge for both physics- based and statistical forecasts that are based on routine catalogues is the low-probability and high-uncertainty nature of the resulting probabilities. Decision-making and scientific advice are all severely hampered under these conditions. Thus, using this new state-of the art earthquake catalog of the 2016-2017 Italian sequence to test physical, statistical and hybrid (physical and statistical) forecasts in space and time will help (a) to test physical models for earthquake occurrences in sequences, and (b) improve the resolution, accuracy and skill of the forecasts. The broader impacts of this project include improvement on seismic risk assessment as well as fostering collaboration between US and European seismologists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this project is to design an innovative thermal switch, which allows the control of heat flow by magnetism. It has been challenging to design systems with desired thermal transport properties as no perfect thermal conductor or insulator exists. Therefore, being able to control heat flow in the generation, transfer, and consumption of energy represents a very important issue. This CAREER project will use a combination of innovative experimental research at national facilities and high-performance computing modeling of heat flow. The principal investigator will collaborate with local high schools to provide an opportunity for students to get exposure to large data sets and learn to use software tools for their analysis through designed extracurricular activities. Other initiatives include science demonstrations at community events targeted to the diverse community in Southern California's Inland Empire and recruitment of high-achieving students from nearby community colleges to spend their summer working on the project.  <br/><br/>This Career project utilizes innovative experimental techniques, supported by computational simulations, to provide the first set of direct measurements of the interactions between the thermal excitations in nuclear structure (phonons) and the thermal excitations in magnetic structure (magnons). The results are expected to illuminate the anisotropic suppression of lattice thermal transport by these interactions, which enables the design and control of a new generation of multifunctional lattice structures with enhanced thermal transport properties. This project builds upon recent advances in neutron scattering techniques by leveraging several inelastic neutron spectrometers to make complementary measurements of phonons and thermal magnetic excitations at temperatures from 10 to 1300 K and under external magnetic fields up to 5 T. The measurements provide dispersion relation, group velocities, and lifetime data for various phonon modes; molecular dynamics simulations based on first principles density functional theory is used to interpret the measured phonon dynamics and to understand the effects of magnetic excitations on lattice thermal transport due to phonon scattering. The success of the project is expected to significantly improve fundamental understanding of how thermal magnetic excitations affect the phonons responsible for the lattice transport; quantify the contribution of the interactions to the anisotropic thermal transport properties; and provide guidelines to tailor the lattice thermal transport using magnetic structure as an additional degree of freedom. The project also extends the use of inelastic neutron scattering as a scientific tool to understand thermal transport process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resultant river discharge of organic carbon to oceans is globally significant. Current estimates of this discharge, however, do not account for material larger than about 0.5 millimeters and thus do not account for pieces of large wood. Because few studies have investigated the drainage-basin-scale patterns of wood delivery, decay, and transport, we have limited knowledge of how large wood influences organic carbon discharge to the ocean. This knowledge gap leads to our primary research goals, which are to (i) quantify annual coarse particulate organic carbon discharge in the form of large wood versus other sources of dissolved and particulate organic carbon from the Mackenzie River drainage of Canada to the Arctic Ocean and (ii) estimate the storage volume, residence time, and decay rates of large wood in the drainage basin. We are conducting this work in the Mackenzie River drainage because it is a relatively pristine large river drainage basin that is known for high rates of wood export to the ocean.<br/><br/>Our primary research aim is to quantify the discharge of large wood (LW) and assess its contribution to the organic carbon (OC) budget of the Mackenzie and the Arctic Ocean, while determining the dynamics of LW transport and its residence time in the river network. We have two specific objectives: (1) Quantify annual biospheric particulate organic carbon flux by LW using ground-based time-lapse photography and high-resolution satellite imagery. (2) Determine LW transport dynamics and the residence time, of LW using ground-based measurements of LW accumulations and satellite imagery. We will characterize residence time and decay rates with a 14C-based chronology of LW. The research plan includes five primary components over two years: At key locations within the Mackenzie River drainage, we will (1) measure LW fluxes, (2) estimate LW recruitment and storage, (3) measure LW volume and age distribution, (4) sample fine suspended sediment to improve particulate OC flux estimates, and (5) collect tree cores that can be used to constrain LW age, provenance, and physical and chemical degradation of LW during transport. The transformative aspects of the proposed research are: (1) quantification of proportions of OC exported as wood versus finer material from a large river, providing insight into the relative importance of different sources of OC under contemporary conditions, and (2) the first assessment of the relative ages of material across the full range of particulate sizes carried by a large river from < 500 microns to large wood, providing a clearer basis for predicting how changes in the fate of coarse POC may impact the carbon cycle under a warming climate. This project will also substantially advance understanding of wood dynamics in large river basins under a warming climate that will alter wood recruitment, transport, and deposition processes, altering timing, volume, and placement of wood exports to the Mackenzie Delta and the Arctic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This mission, which is scheduled to launch in the summer of 2018, will visit the near-Sun regions never explored before by any spacecraft, providing groundbreaking in-situ and close-by remote sensing measurements of the inner heliosphere between 9.5 and 55 solar radii (measured from the center of the Sun), reaching up to six times closer than the Helios mission.  This five-year CAREER project is aimed at improving present understanding of the evolution and structure of turbulence close to the Sun.  The project will also help elucidate how energy is transported from the solar surface to its upper atmosphere and how this energy is dissipated to heat the solar corona and accelerate the solar wind.  One of the main broader impacts of this project is that it will enhance the scientific return of the PSP mission by laying the theoretical foundations for interpretation of PSP measurements, which will have repercussions in a number of other outstanding questions in heliospheric physics.  The project team will introduce a novel and user friendly software tool that will allow students to use numerical simulations, with minimal knowledge of scientific computing, to enhance learning of introductory space plasma physics.  The role that numerical simulations will play in the introductory courses will closely mirror the role that simulations play in modern plasma research, i.e., to facilitate understanding of the underlying physics when analytical progress is no longer possible.  The software interface will allow students to quickly solve numerical problems to gain intuition from the numerical solution to help reinforce understanding of the underlying concepts.  Another main broader impact of this project is that, at its conclusion, a fully tested and working version of this tool will be made available online under the GNU open-source license, to allow for the expansion of its plasma physics problems base and use in other research institutions.  This software tool will also be adapted to disseminate with the general public the research outcomes of this project, and inform them on the relevance of space plasma research and the revolutionary discoveries that the PSP will enable in the decades to come.  The research and EPO agenda of this CAREER project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This CAREER is expected to provide an improved understanding of the origin and evolution of turbulence in the near-Sun environment, from the Alfven waves observed in the low corona to turbulent fluctuations in the upper corona and the solar wind.  This investigation will combine theory, high-resolution numerical simulations and existing observations to lay the groundwork for the interpretation of the unprecedented measurements by the PSP.  The project aims to accomplish the following specific science goals: (i) Investigate how turbulence evolves from AW motions in the solar corona to fully developed AW turbulence at larger heliocentric distances; (ii) identify scaling laws governing the inertial-range power spectrum, the role of cross- helicity and residual energy in the turbulence and how such properties depend on the heliocentric distance; (iii) investigate the role that this turbulence plays in power laws of the magnetic energy spectrum of fluctuations observed by Helios measurements between 0.3 AU and 0.4 AU; and, (iv) establish predictions of the properties of turbulent fluctuations that the PSP will measure.  This CAREER investigation is also timely, because it will lay the theoretical and numerical framework needed for interpretation of the PSP signals before the first measurements become available at the end of 2018.  The outcome of this research combined with the future PSP observations will not only contribute to expand our knowledge of the fundamentals of Alfvenic turbulence in this region, but will lead to transformative advances towards determining the viability of Alfvenic turbulence as a major mechanism for the heating of the corona and the acceleration of the solar wind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, to date it has been challenging to identify the role of the nanostructures in phase change processes owing to their complex structures. To address this problem, this CAREER project will employ extremely regular porous media to investigate thin-film evaporation physics. The structural regularity of such porous media will allow new relationships to be developed between the form of the material and the evaporation heat transfer.

The tasks can be accomplished by studying the self-assembly and metallization of the opal template with surface engineering, multiscale computational models, and high-fidelity measurements to validate understanding of evaporation performance. The new discoveries about the transport physics through porous media will provide a big step forward for the design of next-generation thermal management devices such as microfluidic channels, flexible coolers, and heat pipes that leverage emerging porous materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This heterogeneous character of natural faults is what makes earthquakes complex and difficult to predict. Some fault sections are mostly locked but recurrently host earthquakes. Other sections are creeping and generally stable. However, under poorly understood circumstances, earthquakes that nucleated in an unstable section can propagate far into stable fault sections and result in particularly large and destructive events. This project investigates the causes that lead to activation of the creeping fault sections by combining large-scale laboratory earthquake experiments with physics-based numerical simulations. The modeled fault consists of stable and unstable parts which realistically reproduce the mechanics of earthquakes at heterogeneous faults. A better understanding of the interaction between stable and unstable fault sections will help us evaluate the potential for extremely large earthquakes that will likely enhance existing seismic hazard assessment tools. This project is a benefit to society because it will help us to better understand earthquakes and develop tools to assess these hazards, and it will add to STEM education of students while supporting new researchers in earthquake studies.<br/><br/>This research is a collaborative effort to investigate the mechanics of earthquake rupture arrest with focus on heterogeneous fault properties. It combines multiscale laboratory experiments and numerical modeling. The experiments provide physical constraints for the numerical models, while the modeling improves understanding, generalizing, and scaling up the experimental results. Large-scale laboratory earthquake experiments are conducted on a biaxial machine that generates repeatable sequences of dynamic rupture events contained within a 3-m long granite sample. The fault surfaces are coated with gouge to generate patches of velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening materials. To explore scaling effects, additional experiments are conducted on a 0.76 m tabletop biaxial machine using plastic samples as forcing blocks. Smaller-scale double-direct shear experiments will benchmark the frictional constitutive parameters of the gouge materials, an essential step for the interpretation of the larger-scale laboratory earthquake observations and the development of realistic, high-resolution numerical models of dynamic rupture and arrest. The simulations include sequences of slip events that quantitatively reproduce the relevant scales of the experiments including the actual size of the apparatus and the rupture process zone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sea ice moves under the influence of winds and ocean currents. The ice pack is in constant motion, and as it is brittle, cracks. Cracks open into leads, which form fracture patterns that reorganize with changes in the weather. At fractures, the ice pack shears, opens and closes, and displays ridging. Moreover, the pack ice deformation follow particular relationships common to brittle materials. For example, the size of fractures follow a relationship where the distribution of sizes do not change with the resolution they are measured over. This is termed scale invariance. We also see other emergent behavior of pack ice deformation, with the ice acting as a granular or brittle plastic under the influence of the surface stresses and coastal boundary constraints. We will investigate over which scales that deformation is scale invariant and how the ice pack responds to wind and seasonal changes in ice cover. The insight our project brings to this problem will result in improvements to modeling sea ice drift and deformation in climate and forecasting. This in turn will improve risk assessment and hazard mitigation for Arctic marine operations. It will also allow realistic contaminant dispersion modeling for response to potential environmental disasters such as an oil spill that could become uncontainable.<br/><br/>Our aim is to settle a debate on whether the sea ice internal stress field is anisotropic or isotropic, and whether sea ice displays different plastic behavior over a range of scales, identifying over which scales that deformation is scale invariant. We will investigate the role of boundary conditions and forcing in confining sea ice deformation on scales covering the Arctic Basin, synoptic, and submeso- scale (the spacing of leads and cracks). Following evidence for a transition in the physical mechanism controlling deformation between the synoptic and sub-mesoscale, we will identify how this relates to self-organization of fractures within the ice pack. Our hypotheses are: large-scale deformation is controlled by geometry of the ice pack and surface forcing, winds and ocean currents; apparent transitions in the fractal scaling of deformation are related to changes in the forcing and boundary conditions defining plates of ice between the larger scale fractures; strain weakening along these plate boundaries result in smaller scale ice stress controlled by local heterogeneity in forcing and ice strength; and there is a seasonal transition in scaling of deformation as the pack evolves from confined and consolidated to unconfined and granular. Testing these hypotheses will be through observation directed modeling, using a discrete element method model of the mechanical behavior of pack ice. Controlled comparison experiments with continuum models will verify if particular rheological models are appropriate for sea ice across a variety of scales. We expect to identify models with improved representation of sea ice drift, lead opening and sea ice dispersion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While introducing students to research and the emerging field of biogeotechnics, the program will focus on the intellectual and professional growth of students in the program. Students learn about career and graduate school opportunities, improve their communication skills, and start to develop their professional networks. All involved in the program will embody a culture of inclusion. Program recruitment will focus on students with little opportunity for research at their home institutions and target students from diverse backgrounds and pathways. A goal of the program is that participants' experiences inspire them to consider academic, industry or government careers that focus on the biogeotechnics discipline.<br/><br/>The BBG REU program complements the NSF-funded Engineering Research Center (ERC)for Bio-mediated & Bio-inspired Geotechnics (CBBG). Its primary objectives are to: 1) recruit and prepare students from diverse pathways to increase URG representation in geotechnical engineering; 2) increase awareness of graduate school and career opportunities in engineering; 3) develop students technical and professional skills; 4) emphasize the need to consider sustainable solutions to future engineers and scientists; 5) expose participants to bio-mediated and bio-inspired geotechnologies; 6) advance CBBG research from fundamental research stages to implementation in practice; and 7) create inclusive learning and research environments. The BBG REU targets students from diverse backgrounds and pathways, focusing on institutions where students have limited access to research opportunities. Students from underrepresented groups in engineering, including veterans and students with disabilities, are encouraged to apply. Selected students attend the 10-week apprenticeship program at one of four CBBG partner institutions (UC Davis, Georgia Tech, Arizona State University and New Mexico State University). Activities include a local institution and cross-institution orientation, a one-week CBBG immersion experience for professional development training and activities, weekly webinars/trainings, networking sessions, poster presentations, and social events. All BBG REU projects support new and on-going CBBG research projects. CBBG projects seek to understand and harness the scientific processes and principles of natural phenomena to develop more sustainable, safer, less intrusive, more resilient civil infrastructure systems. The CBBG's approach embodies a transformational shift from traditional energy intensive, mechanical methods for engineering the ground to a sustainable, nature-compatible biogeotechnical approach that employs innovative bio-mediated and bio-inspired technologies to meet the demands of modern society. Throughout the REU program, 48 undergraduate students will complete research projects in the transformative area of biologically-focused civil engineering design. Their exposure is posited to inspire students to consider academic, industry or government careers that focus on protecting society's infrastructure, using low-impact solutions that work in harmony with natural ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This heterogeneous character of natural faults is what makes earthquakes complex and difficult to predict. Some fault sections are mostly locked but recurrently host earthquakes. Other sections are creeping and generally stable. However, under poorly understood circumstances, earthquakes that nucleated in an unstable section can propagate far into stable fault sections and result in particularly large and destructive events. This project investigates the causes that lead to activation of the creeping fault sections by combining large-scale laboratory earthquake experiments with physics-based numerical simulations. The modeled fault consists of stable and unstable parts which realistically reproduce the mechanics of earthquakes at heterogeneous faults. A better understanding of the interaction between stable and unstable fault sections will help us evaluate the potential for extremely large earthquakes that will likely enhance existing seismic hazard assessment tools. This project is a benefit to society because it will help us to better understand earthquakes and develop tools to assess these hazards, and it will add to STEM education of students while supporting new researchers in earthquake studies.<br/><br/>This research is a collaborative effort to investigate the mechanics of earthquake rupture arrest with focus on heterogeneous fault properties. It combines multiscale laboratory experiments and numerical modeling. The experiments provide physical constraints for the numerical models, while the modeling improves understanding, generalizing, and scaling up the experimental results. Large-scale laboratory earthquake experiments are conducted on a biaxial machine that generates repeatable sequences of dynamic rupture events contained within a 3-m long granite sample. The fault surfaces are coated with gouge to generate patches of velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening materials. To explore scaling effects, additional experiments are conducted on a 0.76 m tabletop biaxial machine using plastic samples as forcing blocks. Smaller-scale double-direct shear experiments will benchmark the frictional constitutive parameters of the gouge materials, an essential step for the interpretation of the larger-scale laboratory earthquake observations and the development of realistic, high-resolution numerical models of dynamic rupture and arrest. The simulations include sequences of slip events that quantitatively reproduce the relevant scales of the experiments including the actual size of the apparatus and the rupture process zone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two phase flows are key to processes including additive manufacturing, coating, flow in porous media, aircraft de-icing, and many other natural and engineered flows. The symposium will bring together computational and modeling experts to address major issues in fluid interfaces and contact lines. Featured lectures by leading experts and round-table discussions will provide a range of learning and networking opportunities for early career scientists and students. <br/><br/>The conference is timely in terms of the technical impact and translation to applications.

Understanding the potential toxicity and environmental impacts of silver nanoparticles is challenging. Because silver nanoparticles undergo ionic dissolution, discrepancies exist over the relative contribution of silver ions or the nanoparticles themselves in toxicity.   This project will increase understanding of how silver nanoparticle properties affect bio-uptake, nanoparticle-biological interactions, and ecotoxicity.  Effects of particle surface oxidation and ionic dissolution, which have complicated toxicity studies in the past, will be eliminated. This study will identify properties of silver nanoparticles that make them ecologically disruptive leading to adverse environmental outcomes. All data will be shared through the open-source knowledge base of Nanomaterial-Biological Interactions (NBI) globally for modeling efforts and will support the development of safety protocols, exposure guidelines, and regulations that protect human and ecosystem health. Furthermore, this research will provide design rules for the assembly of new classes of silver nanoparticles that could be commercialized without concern regarding rapid particle degradation and release into the environment. In addition, this project is designed to incorporate students from diverse backgrounds and will help build future science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) talent.<br/><br/>The researcher's overall aim is to improve our understanding of the specific physiochemical features that dictate nanoparticle-biological interactions. First, they will design a series of lipid-coated silver nanoparticles that are differentially shielded from ion dissolution. Differentially shielded silver nanoparticles will be prepared by encapsulating silver nanoparticles of varying size and shape with a hybrid lipid-membrane to protect the surface from oxidation and ionic dissolution. Changes in the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), thermal electron microscope (TEM), and (Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) will be employed to monitor silver ion dissolution from the suite of nanoparticles. Second, they will identify features of lipid-coated nanoparticles that lead to particle instability. The agglomeration kinetics of the hybrid lipid-coated silver nanoparticles will be assessed using dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Third, since the goal is to ultimately relate these material features with nanoparticle-biological interactions, the researchers will determine the uptake and toxicity of the silver nanoparticle suite. Based on preliminary investigations, the hybrid lipid-coated silver nanoparticles with a robust coating should elicit minimal toxicity and a decrease in surface coverage should lead to a respective increase in toxicity. A well-established embryonic zebrafish assay will be used to identify vertebrate morbidity and mortality resulting from exposure and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) will be used to visualize nanoparticle uptake in whole animals. Finally, the researchers will assess the potential ecotoxicity of the suite using a novel nanocosm assay. Hyperspectral imaging will be used to visualize nanoparticle biodistribution among bacteria, algae, crustaceans, and fish in the small-scale freshwater assay. Collectively, the use of well-characterized silver nanoparticles tuned for ion release will allow the PIs to tease apart the relative contribution of the nanoparticle and ion to biouptake, toxicity, and potential for environmental impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to advance understanding about the role of open, volunteered spatial data to produce knowledge needed by public institutions responsible for provision of services to all citizens. Despite that crowdsourced maps contain important information for building resilient communities and infrastructure, rarely are volunteered spatial data integrated into official cartographies. Local and national public institutions may lack trust of data quality, adherence to standards, and completeness. The researchers will closely examine the concepts and practices of using crowdsourced data relative to official cartographies within a small but representative set of national cases characterized by a range of public access, technologies, and governance configurations, namely Mesoamerica and the US Borderlands. This region of interest leverages experience with participatory cross-border harmonization of official fundamental spatial datasets in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize, Mexico, and parts of neighboring Colombia and Texas. Findings will help expand the base of knowledge about evidence-based decision-making. The project will establish a foundation for building community across academic and government sectors interested in sharing and co-creating knowledge on specific applications, such as for hazards, development, and infrastructure services. The research team will provide theoretical insights within Science, Technology, and Society research as well as practical ideas to potentially harness the benefits of the data revolution for the public good.<br/><br/>The research aims are (a) to better understand the barriers and conditions for acceptance when and where crowdsourced spatial data is available to be officially used in Mesoamerica and the US Borderlands (blind spots); (b) to better understand the impact of crowdsourced data when incorporated into official data sources; and (c) to produce missing geospatial data on vulnerabilities by engaging volunteer student mappers and official cartographers through participatory research (blank spots). A mixed-method approach leverages the unique positions of the research team as appointed authorities, commission chairs, and members of the PanAmerican Institute for Geography and History, a specialized arm of the Organization of American States. The researchers will empirically develop knowledge about the needs, opportunities, obstacles, processes and practices of crowdsourcing geospatial data relative to official cartographies. The project will use focus groups, interviews, critical incident techniques, broadly distributed web-based surveys, temporal comparative analysis, and participatory feedback to develop peer-reviewed articles as well as publications of best practices for use by informants, academics, and decision makers, in both English and Spanish. The project will train and engage students in this research from Texas Tech, one of only a few Hispanic Serving, Carnegie R1 Research Institutions in the US.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. <br/><br/>This project will research, design, and develop adaptive accessibility features for interactive science simulations. The proposed research will lay the foundation that advances the accessibility of complex interactives for learning and contribute to solutions to address the significant disparity in science achievement between students with and without disabilities. The PhET Interactive Simulations project at the University of Colorado Boulder and collaborators at Georgia Tech, with expertise in accessible technology and design, will form the project team. The project team will conduct design-based implementation research, where adaptive accessibility features for interactive science simulations are developed through co-design with students with disabilities and their teachers. Students will include those with dyslexia, visual impairments or blindness, and students with intellectual and developmental disabilities, ranging from 5th grade through high school, and recent high school graduates. The adaptive accessibility features will be implemented within a set of PhET interactive science simulations, and allow students with disabilities to access the science simulations with alternative input devices (such as keyboards, switches, and sip-and-puff devices), alter the visual display of the simulations (changing color contrast, zoom and enlarge, and simplify), hear different auditory representations of the visual display (descriptions, sonification, and text-to-speech), and control the rate of simulated events. All features will be capable of being turned on or off and modified on-the-fly by teachers or students through a global control panel that includes curated feature sets, resulting in highly flexible, highly accessible, interactive learning resources. <br/><br/>PhET simulations are widely used in US classrooms, evidence-based, aligned with standards, and highly engaging and effective learning resources. With the proposed highly adaptive features and supporting resources, teachers will be able to quickly adapt the PhET simulations to meet the needs of many students with disabilities, simplifying the task of creating differentiated learning opportunities for students and supporting students with disabilities to engage in collaborative learning - a foundational component of a high-quality STEM education - alongside their non-disabled peers. To research, design, and develop the adaptive features and investigate their use by students, project team members will co-teach in classrooms with students with disabilities and conduct co-design activities with students, where students engage in design thinking to help design and refine the adaptive features to meet identified accessibility needs (their own and those of their peers). In addition, interviews with individual students with and without disabilities will also be conducted, to test early prototypes of individual features, to later refine the layering of the many different features, and to ensure the presence of adaptive features does not negatively impact traditional use of the simulations. The proposed work also includes surveys of teachers and students and analysis of teacher use, to refine global control features, develop curated feature sets, and develop supporting teacher resources. The project will address key questions at the heart of educational design for students with diverse needs, including how to make adaptive features that support student achievement of specific learning goals. The project will use design-based implementation research, with significant co-designing with students with disabilities (including visual impairments, cognitive disabilities, or dyslexia), interviews, case studies, and classroom implementation to design and evaluate the accessibility features. This will inform new models and theories of learning with technology. The project will investigate: 1) How students engage with, use, and learn from adaptive accessibility features, 2) how adaptive accessibility features can be designed to layer harmoniously together in a learning resource, and 3) how to effectively support access to rich, dynamic feature controls and curated feature sets for intuitive classroom use by students and teachers. The project will produce 8 PhET simulations with adaptive accessibility features and supporting teacher resources. The foundational research knowledge will result in effective design and implementation of adaptive accessibility features through the analysis of student engagement, usability, and learning from accessible simulations. Additionally, the project will provide technical infrastructure, exemplars, and software for use by other STEM education technology developers. The project team will work together to create a deep understanding of how to design adaptive science simulations with practical, usable, effective accessibility, so that learners with diverse needs can advance their science content knowledge and participate in science practices alongside their peers. The work has great potential to transform STEM learning for students with disabilities and to make simulations more effective for all learners. Results will provide insight into the effectiveness of accessible simulation-based activities and their corresponding teacher materials in engaging students in science practices and learning in the classroom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is the single most expensive disease in the US ($236B direct; $221B indirect costs). The size of the US population with AD doubles every 15 years. The drug failure rate for AD is among the highest, currently 99.6. Fall accidents account for 26% of all AD related hospitalizations and are a major concern and key cost contributor, with an average fall rate of 4 falls per year and 3 in 4 repeated falls. Unfortunately, safety products developed for falls were developed for cognitively aware adults and not designed specifically for individuals with AD. The proposed system will change the quality of care and operations in memory care facilities, increase quality of life for patients and families, and help the medical profession gain a better understanding of dementia. <br/><br/><br/>The proposed project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer's care by detecting safety critical events, based on camera video where events can be reviewed by a human assistant in real-time and after the fact. It is expected to achieve two main objectives that advance science and technology: (1) Demonstrating the ability for our machine learning algorithms to automatically perform safety critical tasks, by learning over a sufficiently rich set of data. These extend existing methods for fall detection to include (a) fall prediction; (b) wandering detection; (c) bed sores detections; (2) enabling the Company to demonstrate that the system proposed can run with a fully operational HIL paradigm running at scale with up to 1000 patients in 100 memory care facilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will explore the needs of the 3D printing industry as the technology is applied to ever more demanding areas such as aerospace and automotive.  In aerospace, each component must be produced by a verified and validated procedure, and in-situ inspection can meet that need.  In the automotive industry, representative components must be evaluated to verify production procedures and equipment operation; again, in-situ inspection can meet this need.   In addition to aerospace and automotive, 3D printed metal structures are expected to have wide commercial applications, ranging from health to defense.  In these applications, safety and reliability are paramount.  For example, a 3D printed replacement for a broken bone must be highly resistant to breakage itself.  However, the mass limitations for a bone replacement require efficiency in design and a trust in fabrication.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method that is used to observe the metal structure while it is being printed or upon completion of the manufacturing process.  Historically, metal parts must be subjected to destructive inspection methods to meet high reliability requirements after manufacturing.  This alternative NDE is based on a novel X-ray imaging method, grating-based interferometry, first introduced about ten years ago.  In this method, micro-fabricated X-ray optics are used to enhance the X-ray image, especially for the detection of sub-micron features.  The traditional X-ray image is improved with an overlay image that reveals the presence of sub-micron features.  Recently, sub-micron features in 3D printed metal components have been correlated with preliminary crack formation under fatigue stress.  Therefore, an X-ray grating-based interferometry image of a freshly printed structure (either in-progress or completed) can reveal the presence of failure points.  By demonstrating the viability of this unique NDE methodology to potential users of 3D printed parts, it is anticipated that new market segments can gain sufficient confidence in part reliability to incorporate these 3D printed parts into critical components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But how do individuals discern important information from that which can or should be disregarded? Most of the research on learning in humans and other animals has focused on models in which information is acquired via first-hand experience. Direct exposure to an event, however, is not the only way that individuals gather knowledge or form memories. Evidence suggests that humans and other primates can develop fear associations from a social context, by observing or interacting with others. For example, a person may have an intense fear of snakes despite having never come across a live snake. In today's society, the likelihood of witnessing traumatic episodes and indirectly acquiring fear is magnified by the omnipresence of technology and constant access to the news and social media. Like humans, rats are very social animals and learn to infer information about their environment through their interactions with other rats. The PI's laboratory has recently developed a procedure by which rats acquire fear through social transmission (a model called fear conditioning by proxy). Fear conditioning by proxy provides a sensitive means of examining how social information is transferred between individuals. A different model, social transmission of food preference, allows the investigators to examine the transmission of appetitive or rewarding information. By executing the two different and complementary paradigms in parallel (fear conditioning by proxy and social transmission of food preference), the investigators will be able to isolate factors that selectively underlie social transmission of information from those which are specific to a given paradigm. This is important, because identifying the social and mechanistic factors contribute to how people acquire fear could also lead to interventions that extinguish or diminish fears that are socially acquired.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to identify the social factors and neural mechanisms that foster transmission of information between members of a species, and determine what accounts for the broad variability in individuals' propensity to learn via social transmission. First, the investigators will identify factors (e.g., dominance status, kinship) that promote social transmission of information using two complementary behavioral paradigms: fear conditioning by proxy and social transmission of food preference. Second, the investigators will disambiguate the neural networks that are unique to social transmission of information, and those that are shared with learning through direct experience, using a sophisticated technique that allows selective labeling of cells involved in a given task at a specific time. Third, the investigators will test their prediction that a specific population of cells in the lateral hypothalamus accounts for individual differences in fear conditioning by proxy and social transmission of food preference. This project combines sophisticated and thorough behavioral tests, as well as complementary cellular and anatomical methods to address the neural mechanisms that drive behavioral differences. A strength of these techniques is that they will provide high spatial and temporal resolution, while allowing for on-going sampling of behavior, to understand how knowledge is transferred between individuals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the leading causes of death and debilitation.  A common means of terminating harmful rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator.  The pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable defibrillators, and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical for atrial fibrillation.  The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the field of defibrillation therapy and aims to lead to the introduction of a new class of implantable medical device technology.<br/><br/>The proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that achieves non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the painless termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening arrhythmias.  Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from sudden cardiac arrest.  The team intends to initially target the development of a device to achieve rapid and painless termination of life threatening arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation. The successful development of the proposed device has the potential to benefit millions of patients.  Additionally, by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis, the proposed device may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias.  The phase II project will develop and evaluate a prototype system.  It is anticipated that the project will result in a new implantable medical device that painlessly terminates atrial fibrillation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Living in a social group with other animals may require a bigger brain in order to deal with the cognitive challenge of maintaining social relationships. Alternatively, animals in social groups may have smaller brains because members of social groups can work together, thus reducing the cognitive challenge faced by each individual. This research will measure brain size in closely related species of social and solitary bees. Social cooperation has evolved many times in bees, and has also been lost many times: some solitary bees evolved from social ancestors.  This project will also measure levels of neurotransmitters and hormones in bee brains that are associated with aggression and reproduction. Scientists still do not have a clear understanding of how even relatively simple brain differences are associated with the evolution of complex behavioral traits. This research will use the small brains of bees and the multiple comparisons between many different social and solitary species to investigate how living in a cooperative social group affects the brain.  The scientists involved in the project will mentor students through internships in their labs, and will write versions of their research publications aimed at middle- and high-school aged students that will be made freely available on the web for education and outreach. <br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that the evolution of social cooperation leads to increased brain size. This research focuses on measuring changes in the volume of the mushroom body (an area of the insect brain), and biogenic amines of the brains of social and solitary bees. The researchers focus on the sweat bees (Halictidae) because this group is ancestrally solitary with three evolutionary origins of sociality and multiple evolutionary losses from within the social clades. Also, many species are socially polymorphic, exhibiting both social and solitary behavior. This allows for multiple phylogenetically independent social-solitary comparisons. The researchers focus on mushroom body volume because this area of the brain is used for learning, memory, and sensory integration. They measure biogenic brain amines because these chemicals are involved in regulating aggressive, social, and reproductive behavior, and thus likely involved in the evolution of social cooperation. Lastly, they test whether changes in levels of brain amines are mechanistically linked to changes in brain size, and also measure changes in amine receptor density associated with social behavior. This work uses a phylogenetic comparative approach, confocal microscopy measurements of brain volume, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements of amine titers, and antibody staining of amine-reactive neurons to test how evolutionary gains and losses of social cooperation affect the brain. This work addresses issues of broad public appeal - brain evolution and cooperation. As part of the broader impacts of this project, researchers will work with professional editors to create open-access adaptations of their studies for use in classrooms or other educational or outreach purposes. They will also train graduate and undergraduate students across five different institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Online search can infer the popularity or relevance of a page based on data from millions of users, including a user's location and what they've shown interest in; however, business users don't benefit from these features. Users view concepts in a summary linked to a knowledge base, allowing them to see summaries, triage documents on mobile devices, write rules to sort or filter them automatically, and see key data before ever opening the document.  This Phase II project improves information extraction systems by generating answerboxes from complex documents. Consumers will be able to quickly get the gist of formal documents such as consumer credit contracts, insurance policies, industry solicitations, engineering and other difficult-to-read documents. This innovation advances knowledge discovery, information retrieval methods, information extraction, slot-filling, and knowledge-base population.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project discovers unsupervised and unrestricted slots and fillers (attributes and values) to construct structured summaries based on keywords and underlying patterns in document collections. It extends the state of the art by not requiring a manually crafted catalogue of slots and complements supervised approaches by discovering new slots. While conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are effective on well-formed sentences, the techniques described here are effective for semi-structured content such as section headers, lists and tables. Additionally, NLP based approaches for fact extraction and text summarization are primarily lexical, requiring further processing for disambiguating and linking to unique entities and concepts in a knowledge base. This approach further advances the state of the art by eliminating these steps as it identifies keywords and links to knowledge base concepts as a first step in the discovery process.

Severe natural disasters during the past decade include unprecedented flooding, catastrophic hurricanes, and devastating wildfires.  The worst wildfire in California history struck Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in December 2017.  The Thomas Fire in those counties burned 282,000 acres, took two lives, and incinerated or damaged over one thousand structures. Because of its location to major population centers, over 100,000 residents were evacuated, many more than once.  In the aftermath of the fire, rain produced a massive mudslide cascading through the city of Montecito killing 23 people and destroying 115 homes.  These catastrophic events within a geographically concentrated region offer a unique opportunity to better understand how individuals and families cope with and recover from profound stress.  The focus of this project is to gain a richer understanding of how individuals and families manage post-disaster recovery and what predicts both positive and negative outcomes. By bringing together a multi-disciplinary team of computer scientists and disaster psychologists, new theories and computational methods will be evaluated to better understand human response to extreme events and to inform the development of future interventions.<br/><br/>Using Smart Phone technology and online surveys over a six-month period of time, 100 parent/child pairs and 100 non-parent survivors in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties will be followed.  The surveys and the daily ""check-ins"" will provide critical data on how people cope with stress across time.  By cultivating a very rich set of data on the same individuals over time, it will be possible to discern patterns of recovery in ways that past research has not done.  Measuring outcomes on a daily basis will generate significant data and support the use of ""big data"" analysis methods (e.g., machine learning techniques) that can identify unique changes or shifts in functioning predicted by the guiding theoretical framework (self-regulation shift theory).

According to statista.com, the number of smartphone users in the world will be more than five billion by 2019. The popularity of these mobile devices is due to a unique set of features including ubiquitous Internet access through communication technologies such as Wifi and 4G/LTE, easy to use touch-based inputs, and numerous applications and games. In the meantime, the security of mobile devices is becoming a major concern as device users are storing sensitive data such as personal contacts and utilizing sensitive applications like banking and stock trading. Strong authentication as the forefront defense mechanism can prevent unauthorized access to a mobile device that may lead to lack of accountability, data loss or stealing, and identity theft. Due to the popularity of mobile devices and their uses in government, business, and even military applications, securing mobile devices with secure, memorable, and usable authentication is of great societal importance.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on exploring the market potential for multi-dimensional authentication schemes. The new paradigm of multi-dimensional authentication schemes can achieve better memorability, security, and usability at the same time. The new schemes fuse information from multiple dimensions to form a password, allowing the schemes to enlarge the password space and improve memorability by reducing memory interference. The information fusion can increase usability as fewer input gestures are required for passwords of the same security strength. The schemes can also be shoulder-surfing resistant. A successful authentication requires a user to respond to a random challenge so that a set of predefined rules are satisfied after adjustments made by the user. The schemes can also be used for continuously monitoring device user behavior to ensure the current device users is a user authorized to use the device.

Phylogenies too have begun to see application outside of biology in such diverse fields of study as comparative linguistics, anthropology, and forensic science. Meanwhile, the computational environment known as 'R' has developed into one of the leading platforms for scientific computing. The strength of R comes from the literally thousands of contributed function libraries (called ""packages"") developed and distributed for free by computational scientists and developers that are not members of the R core development team. Because of these contributions, R has grown into the preeminent software platform for manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing phylogenetic trees. That said, the capability to actually estimate phylogenetic trees from data in R remains relatively limited. The major objective of this award is to substantially extend the toolkit that is available to undertake phylogeny estimation in the R scientific computing environment. This toolkit will be built using an open development model and will be distributed as a free and open-source resource to the national and international scientific communities. Among the major advantages of developing software for scientific computing in R is that so doing dramatically facilitates scientific reproducibility by allowing all stages of the data analysis pipeline to be built into a single, fully reproducible workflow from open source components.<br/><br/>This research will create new, open-source, and freely distributed software tools that will be of broad utility throughout the phylogenetic scientific community and beyond. The general goal is computational infrastructure development for phylogenetics in R. These investigators will focus on four specific objectives in particular: (1) the development and application of methods to compute distances between trees; (2) the development of new consensus and average tree methods; (3) the development of joint species-tree estimation methods based on likelihood; and, finally, (4) the application of visualization tools for sets of trees and phylogenetic networks. They focus specifically on these research objectives because they interact in particularly interesting ways and because they reflect areas in which substantial research is needed; however, research on these topics will likely result in unanticipated discoveries in fundamentally new areas. The award will also support postdoctoral and graduate training, the latter via an intensive, phylogeny methods boot camp for young developers. This training objective will be undertaken with the aim of helping to form the next generation of computational phylogenetic biologists and will target for participation graduate students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.

The overarching goal of the proposed research is to increase the recruitment, retention, and preparation of Hispanic and African American students for STEM careers. We focus on the subtle yet significant messages that minority students encounter in STEM contexts that undermine their success. We uniquely consider the ways that allies, or majority group members who strive to end oppression toward, and advocate on behalf of, minority group members, can effectively address subtle discrimination, and thus ultimately support the STEM interest, efficacy, achievement, and workplace success of minority students.

One explanation for this shortage is the subtle differences in students' formative college experiences. In so doing, we build and test a conceptual model that uniquely integrates attributional ambiguity and stress and coping theories with emerging insights about the influence of allies. We advance robust logic based on evidence from the fields related to the organizational science to propose that the ambiguity of subtle discrimination depletes cognitive and affective resources necessary for achievement in STEM. This reasoning reflects the first thorough analysis of why and how subtle discrimination is problematic and points directly to ambiguity reduction strategies as powerful theory-driven buffers of these effects. We blend complementary methods of experience sampling and laboratory experiment to build theoretically meaningful and practically useful knowledge. This work will provide specific, evidence-based strategies to support African American and Hispanic college students, thereby enhancing their STEM interest, efficacy, motivation, achievement, and ultimately career choice and success in organizations. In particular, we focus on the previously unexamined role of motivated observers--allies--in reducing the consequences of subtle discrimination for its targets and thus catalyze new diversity science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology can have several broader impacts on society: (1) as a nation, we are in need of creative solutions to improve the general health and fitness of our citizens; (2) according to the US Census bureau, in 2050, the 65+ age population is predicted to be over 80 million (twice that in 2012) who need to be fit; and (3) chronic illnesses result in significant reduction in productivity of the working population - the severity of illness can be reduced by improving the fitness of the individual.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project aims (1) to determine what the customer segments and value propositions are for the technology; (2) to identify in what format the application should be delivered to make a market/product fit; and (3) to establish the readiness to transit the technology as an automated marketable service product. As of today, the technology exists as a manually prescribing procedure for patients who suffer from fatigue symptom. It has been thoroughly validated by pilot tests. Personalization features gauge and match multi-level factors, so the likelihood of adherence to the physical activity prescription is very high. The Exergame Grading Scheme is used to rate intensity of fitness attributes and energy expenditure of exergames and fitness app. The personalized physical activity prescriptions are generated by the Exergame Grading Scheme based algorithm, so that the prescription can challenge the individual's functional capacity. The intellectual merit lies in: (1) identifying the right combination of hardware/software technologies that can accurately implement the product; and (2) implementing a solution that is scalable in mass volumes with low cost per unit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This system can be beneficial for a wide range of companies including e-commerce, business intelligence, and database and could systems. It is envisioned that this technology will be used in two ways: First, companies can use the system internally to enable easier and faster data access for their employees, thereby reducing dependence on database administrators and cutting costs. Second, companies could use the system externally to provide a better search interface to their customers. In addition, this technology can potentially also be useful to academic researchers, particularly within social and natural sciences, by allowing them to easily extract relevant data.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project provides an interface for extracting data from databases by writing English sentences. Although relational databases are the most common choice for the storage of information, retrieving a relevant subset of the data from them requires expertise in a formal query language. This technology allows end-users to query information stored in a relational database without having to learn a formal query language. The technology is based on a research which combines advanced natural language processing techniques with automated program synthesis and repair. A key advantage of this approach is that it is database-agnostic and does not require end-users to know the database schema.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, they often become targets of viral pathogens as a means of immune evasion and mechanisms of dissemination. Ranaviruses, which infect amphibians, are increasing in both prevalence and in the range of host species infected. This raises pressing concerns for biodiversity and aquaculture, and poses fundamental issues related to evolution of host/pathogen interactions. Indeed, the remarkable emerging features of ranavirus infections appear intimately linked to controlling immune responses in many host species, and growing evidence hints at macrophages as critical for their infection strategy. The goal of this research is to elucidate the complex roles of distinct amphibian adult and tadpole macrophage populations in orchestrating host immune defenses against ranavirus, while serving as reservoirs for ranavirus immune evasion and dissemination. The hypothesis addressed is that the ranavirus Frog virus 3 (FV3) targets macrophages to evade host immune defenses towards viral persistence and dissemination in the frog Xenopus laevis. The specific aims are to determine the phenotypes and fates of tadpole and adult macrophage subsets targeted by FV3; define molecular and cellular interactions of FV3 with tadpole and adult macrophages; and elucidate the roles of macrophages in host defenses and asymptomatic infections. The work will involve training of students at all levels, as well as public engagement through development of interactive programs at a local science museum. The researcher will also continue to develop and manage a resource for Xenopus immunobiology reagents and training.  <br/><br/><br/>Macrophages are both at the forefront of immune defenses against ranavirus (Iridoviridae) pathogens and part of ranavirus infection strategies, which is unique among large DNA viruses. The dramatic worldwide increases in ranges of populations and species infected raise alarming concerns for biodiversity and aquaculture, and pose fundamental issues related to evolution of host/pathogen interactions. The overall goal of this proposed research is to elucidate the complex roles of distinct amphibian adult and tadpole macrophage populations in orchestrating host immune defenses, while serving as reservoirs for immune evasion and dissemination. The project will take advantage of the extensively characterized Xenopus/FV3 model system that permits reverse genetic as well as mechanistic experimental approaches from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organism level. The guiding hypothesis is that FV3 targets amphibian macrophages to evade host immune defenses towards viral persistence and dissemination.  The specific aims are (1) to determine the phenotypes and fates of larval and adult macrophage subsets targeted by FV3; (2) to define molecular and cellular interactions of FV3 with larval and adult macrophages; and (3) to elucidate the roles of macrophages in host defenses and asymptomatic infections. These aims will utilize technologies developed during the past NSF funding period, including RNAi-based and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function by transgenesis; traceable recombinant FV3 and FV3 knockout mutants deficient for virulence/immunomodulatory genes; adoptive macrophage transfer into inbred recipients; Xenopus macrophage cultures; macrophage depletion; and the use of specific Abs against Xenopus macrophages and FV3.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CTE also supports greater understanding of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) content and development of STEM competencies for a broad range of students. Access to careers in high demand CTE areas is especially important for students in rural areas and in poverty. Building a strong talent pool in rural areas could increase the economic growth of these communities. Unfortunately, overall enrollments are low in many CTE programs that educate students for high demand technical career pathways (e.g., computer science and information technology). Although they are limited in scope, studies suggest that the low enrollment may result from student misperceptions that make pursuing CTE programs undesirable. <br/><br/>This project will: (1) use surveys and regional workshops to identify misperceptions and biases within a comprehensive group of stakeholders; (2) collect and analyze information to develop a new CTE communication and outreach strategy; (3) implement the new communication and outreach strategy;  and (4) create an analytics platform to regularly evaluate and assess the effectiveness of this implementation. The proposed activities could increase knowledge about challenges that are common across all states, as well as issues that may be unique to Utah. The resulting implementation plan has the potential to replace misperceptions about CTE with more realistic perceptions about the high value of CTE for specific target audiences. The ability to assess whether the new communication strategy changes behavior, including decision making by stakeholders, may be relevant for developing effective communication and outreach strategies for communicating the overall value of STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator will examine social, political, and legal facets of a city that is undertaking massive and disruptive planning and infrastructural interventions in response to projections of significant increases in flooding.  This project will contribute to basic understanding of the political and legal debates that emerge in flood-prone cities between those who argue that property rights need to be constrained to implement infrastructure improvements and enforce land-use regulations and those who advocate strengthening property rights to empower community-based efforts at flood mitigation.  The project will inform debates about laws and policies concerning the terms of eviction and resettlement for flood mitigation initiatives. The project will also contribute to theoretical debates about the ways that hazard risk impacts dynamics of urban politics.  The findings will provide new insights for flood-threatened cities in the United States, such as New Orleans, Boston, and New York, in addition to cities on other continents, such as Jakarta, Indonesia; Bangkok, Thailand; Manila, Philippines; Lagos, Nigeria; and Alexandria, Egypt.  The project also will help build infrastructure for research on policy issues related to flooding and risk management in the United States and elsewhere.<br/><br/>While substantial research attention has focused on infrastructural and governance questions related to floods, there has been relatively little attention given to the social, political, and legal implications of flooding.  With increases in the number and magnitude of major urban floods in recent decades and further increases projected for the coming decades, however, many delta cities are undertaking policy and planning initiatives and political reforms that raise fundamental questions about the distribution of hazard resilience and the costs of mitigation efforts.  Questions of property rights constitute a key element in debates over flood mitigation, because the interactions among land, water, and human systems that are under question in these debates are related intrinsically to the question of who has what rights to use land.  This project will focus on key questions that are central to these issues:  How have state actors sought to redefine property rights in light of flood risk? What strategies have non-state actors pursued to contest eviction and assert their own claims?  What legal and institutional changes have resulted?  What are the implications of these dynamic interactions for urban politics?  In his investigation of a case study of one major metropolis astride a large delta, the investigator will review documents, policy reports, and media accounts, and he will conduct interviews with key actors in order to analyze court cases concerning the property rights of low-income communities that face eviction under government initiatives to ""normalize"" rivers to improve drainage.  He will employ a geographic information system to evaluate the spatial dynamics of eviction accompanying efforts to increase green space.  He also will analyze government reports and plans, academic studies, media accounts, and information garnered through interviews with key stakeholders to assess shifting perspectives on property rights resulting from a major government flood mitigation initiative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change has a scientifically evident impact on the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme weather events. It has become imperative for organizations in all sectors to gain a clear understanding of the impacts of climate change on their business so as to inform strategic planning and risk management strategies. Those in the risk transfer industry, in particular reinsurance companies, are the most likely early adopters given their technical sophistication and their increasing and acute awareness of the financial impacts climate change now has on their bottom line. Thus, the company's goal is to penetrate the reinsurance industry as an entry point to the more broadly defined risk transfer industry. Subsequently, the company will utilize the platform to address problems in agricultural investment, real estate investment, and energy planning - all sectors that will be adversely impacted by climate change in specific, well-defined ways. The adaptation in each of these sectors is vital to the well-being and prosperity of the ultimate stakeholder: the American taxpayer. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to harness industry knowledge and expand on the technical work conducted during the company's Phase I project, with the objective of building a modular software platform generalizable to multiple key climate change hazards and extensible to other strategically identified sectors. The knowledge gathered via customer discovery interviews in Phase I will serve as a guide for product development. The technical work completed in Phase I, in particular extreme precipitation modeling under climate change and its application to the risk transfer sector, will serve as a foundation for expansion into the modeling of additional hazards. There are currently no tools available that integrate climate change informatics into risk management at scale. The company aims to address this problem through the translation of physics-guided statistical modeling to a commercial software platform. Upon conclusion of the Phase II project, the company expects to have a completed product that will house data on additional hazards exacerbated by climate change, with applications in the agriculture, commercial real estate, and the energy sectors. The company will show product value through sector-tailored software demonstrations and case studies that demonstrate return on investment to be realized by using this platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Living in a social group with other animals may require a bigger brain in order to deal with the cognitive challenge of maintaining social relationships. Alternatively, animals in social groups may have smaller brains because members of social groups can work together, thus reducing the cognitive challenge faced by each individual. This research will measure brain size in closely related species of social and solitary bees. Social cooperation has evolved many times in bees, and has also been lost many times: some solitary bees evolved from social ancestors.  This project will also measure levels of neurotransmitters and hormones in bee brains that are associated with aggression and reproduction. Scientists still do not have a clear understanding of how even relatively simple brain differences are associated with the evolution of complex behavioral traits. This research will use the small brains of bees and the multiple comparisons between many different social and solitary species to investigate how living in a cooperative social group affects the brain.  The scientists involved in the project will mentor students through internships in their labs, and will write versions of their research publications aimed at middle- and high-school aged students that will be made freely available on the web for education and outreach. <br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that the evolution of social cooperation leads to increased brain size. This research focuses on measuring changes in the volume of the mushroom body (an area of the insect brain), and biogenic amines of the brains of social and solitary bees. The researchers focus on the sweat bees (Halictidae) because this group is ancestrally solitary with three evolutionary origins of sociality and multiple evolutionary losses from within the social clades. Also, many species are socially polymorphic, exhibiting both social and solitary behavior. This allows for multiple phylogenetically independent social-solitary comparisons. The researchers focus on mushroom body volume because this area of the brain is used for learning, memory, and sensory integration. They measure biogenic brain amines because these chemicals are involved in regulating aggressive, social, and reproductive behavior, and thus likely involved in the evolution of social cooperation. Lastly, they test whether changes in levels of brain amines are mechanistically linked to changes in brain size, and also measure changes in amine receptor density associated with social behavior. This work uses a phylogenetic comparative approach, confocal microscopy measurements of brain volume, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements of amine titers, and antibody staining of amine-reactive neurons to test how evolutionary gains and losses of social cooperation affect the brain. This work addresses issues of broad public appeal - brain evolution and cooperation.

If the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into the national civilian airspace, the private-sector drone industry is estimated to generate more than 100K high-paying technical jobs over a ten-year span and contribute $82B to the U.S. economy. Self-driving cars are predicted to annually prevent 5M accidents and 2M injuries, conserve 7B liters of fuel, and save 30K lives and $190B in healthcare costs associated with accidents in the U.S. Successful mission pursuit of such fully autonomous CPS hinges on possessing full situational awareness including precise knowledge of its own location. Current CPS are far from possessing this capability, particularly in dynamic, uncertain, poorly modeled environments where GPS coverage may be spotty, obscured, or otherwise impaired. This necessitates developing a coherent analytical foundation to deal with this emerging class of CPS, in which situational awareness and mission planning and execution are intertwined and must be considered simultaneously to address uncertainty, model mismatch, and compensate for potential GPS coverage gaps.<br/><br/>This project is has four main objectives: (1) Analyze the observability of unknown dynamic, stochastic environments comprising multiple agents. This analysis will establish the minimum a priori knowledge needed about the environment and/or agents for stochastic observability. (2) Develop adaptation strategies to refine the agents models of the environment, on-the-fly, as the agents build spatiotemporal maps. Adaptation is crucial, since it is impractical to assume that agents have high-fidelity models describing the environment. (3) Design optimal, computationally efficient information fusion algorithms with performance guarantees. These algorithms will consider physically realistic nonlinear dynamics and observations with colored, non-Gaussian noise, commonly encountered in CPS. (4) Synthesize optimal, real-time decision making strategies to balance the potentially conflicting objectives of information gathering and mission fulfillment. This investigation will enable autonomous CPS to navigate complex tradeoffs, leading to autonomous identification and adoption of the optimal strategy. <br/><br/>This research has far-reaching impact- it will evolve autonomous CPS from merely sensing the environment to making sense of the environment, bringing new capabilities in environments where direct human control is not physically or economically possible. The project has a vertically-integrated education plan spanning K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. The project will engage economically disadvantaged middle and high school students in the same UAV testbed used for research verification. Also, research outcomes will be infused into new and existing undergraduate and graduate courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Between 780,000-900,000 of these veterans have sought medical care connected to their military service, and roughly 25% have a documented service-connected disability. Amid ongoing concerns about institutional inadequacies and the relentless problem of veteran suicide, public policy and popular attention have been turning to veteran's family members as a key resource to help those encumbered by service-connected debility. Care for these veterans is generally thought of as spread across two disparate yet occasionally overlapping spheres: medical institutions, such as the VA, and veteran families. Policy, legislation, and other efforts to support veterans are overwhelmingly targeted at these two spheres, and while much of the help injured veterans need is indeed provided by either clinicians or family members, among post-9/11 veterans 23% of those providing informal everyday care are friends and neighbors, a uniquely high percentage compared to previous generations of veterans and civilian populations alike. Current research offers a partial picture of the effects of caregiving in military and veteran families, and this has led to important policy initiatives such as Joining Forces and the VA family caregiver support program. However, virtually nothing is known about informal veteran caregiving beyond the family, and non-family caregivers are not supported by VA or other programs. Furthermore, the exclusive focus on family - particularly wives - as the source of informal care can lead to negative social and health outcomes including caregiver burnout for family caregivers and narrowed life options for veterans. While roughly 20% of Americans are disabled, and many disability communities have developed innovative models for sustaining long-term informal care outside of the family, injured veterans are not usually considered part of broader disability communities. As a CAREER project, the project implements a range of educational activities aimed at improving the public's understanding of disability and veterans issues. This includes a free public online course, and resources that will be available on a public website.To help create conversations and linkages between veteran and non-veteran disability communities, the project includes the creation of a free online disability studies course designed specifically for veterans, as well as a workshop that will bring together members from both veteran and non-veteran communities to discuss shared experiences and strategies and to create community caregiving resources which will be made publically available through an accessible website. The project also provides training for undergraduate and graduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis.<br/><br/>With the support of a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, Dr. Zoe Wool of Rice University will explore the ways in which socialities of care for disabled veterans are improvised within, beyond, and against kinship and other existent infrastructures of care. This project combines long term ethnographic data collection, semi-structured interviews, and social network analysis to understand and map the full range of caregiving relationships that emerge around injured post-9/11 veterans. The research will be conducted in Houston, TX, and at an innovative new intentional community for injured veterans in New Orleans, LA. The project also aims to understand the way family and non-family caregiving relationships may interact with each other and may be shaped by caregiving--and expectations around family relationships, in similar or different ways. In addition, the project looks to non-veteran disability communities in California and New York, which each have a rich history of experiments in social arrangements of informal caregiving, including the relatively recent model of care collectives. In addition to understanding the kinds of relationships people count on for care, the project investigates the duration and temporality of these relationships, with a special focus on the ways various caregiving relationships are shaped by the need for improvisation that often accompanies life lived with chronic illness or impairment. The project will advance anthropological and broader social scientific theories of sociality, care, disability, and kinship. Bringing the worlds of injured veterans together with the worlds of broader disability communities practiced in developing alternative caregiving networks may lead to new ways of thinking about informal long-term care and the policies that support it, both for veterans, and for the millions of other disabled Americans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, African American and Hispanic people comprise less than 10% of the STEM workforce. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to increase the recruitment, retention, and preparation of Hispanic and African American students for STEM careers. We focus on the subtle yet significant messages that minority students encounter in STEM contexts that undermine their success. We uniquely consider the ways that allies, or majority group members who strive to end oppression toward, and advocate on behalf of, minority group members, can effectively address subtle discrimination, and thus ultimately support the STEM interest, efficacy, achievement, and workplace success of minority students. In summary, the findings from this work will serve as an impetus for scholarship on minority stress interventions and ally engagement. Additionally, it will offer immediately applicable strategies for retaining African American and Hispanic students in STEM, a necessary step for increasing the representation of racial minorities in the U.S. STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This research pursues the overarching goal of developing and testing strategies that enhance the retention of African American and Hispanic students in STEM careers by identifying and evaluating ally behaviors that reduce the detrimental consequences of subtle discrimination. One explanation for this shortage is the subtle differences in students' formative college experiences. In so doing, we build and test a conceptual model that uniquely integrates attributional ambiguity and stress and coping theories with emerging insights about the influence of allies. We advance robust logic based on evidence from the fields related to the organizational science to propose that the ambiguity of subtle discrimination depletes cognitive and affective resources necessary for achievement in STEM. This reasoning reflects the first thorough analysis of why and how subtle discrimination is problematic and points directly to ambiguity reduction strategies as powerful theory-driven buffers of these effects. We blend complementary methods of experience sampling and laboratory experiment to build theoretically meaningful and practically useful knowledge. This work will provide specific, evidence-based strategies to support African American and Hispanic college students, thereby enhancing their STEM interest, efficacy, motivation, achievement, and ultimately career choice and success in organizations. In particular, we focus on the previously unexamined role of motivated observers--allies--in reducing the consequences of subtle discrimination for its targets and thus catalyze new diversity science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerous technologies presently exist for detecting Infrared radiation.  Those which are cost effective for commercial applications tend to lack adequate performance specifications, while those with ideal performance are too expensive.  This technology has broad application potential.  The proposed I-Corps program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities within the project's initial application focus of Nondispersive Infrared (NDIR) gas sensing of carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as methane and ethylene gas.  These sensors have significant markets related to smart ventilation systems for cars, homes, and businesses, as well as leak monitoring in industrial processes and oil and gas production.  Further enabling the mass deployment of these sensors will have significant impact on energy conservation, environmental protection, and health and safety.  Additionally, longer term development of the technology may prove to be disruptive in thermal imaging applications.  Presently, thermal imaging applications are broad but the hardware is often too cumbersome and expensive to be practical for commercial use.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the premise that the intersection of different scientific disciplines leads to disruptive innovation.  The project's technology is a fundamentally different approach to infrared radiation detection than those developed in the past 50+ years.  This project pursues an optical solution to a semiconductor material processing problem which has hampered the realization of adequate production yield, manufacturing scalability, and device performance, resulting in too high a cost and limited suitability for many commercial applications.  Previous progress on this project has focused on the theoretical development of the optical design and experimental verification of these nanofabricated structures.  Initial results have been encouraging, and work continues to enhance responsivity, as well as other necessary device specifications.  This I-Corps process will be used to refine our understanding of customer problems/needs and the potential for our technology to solve them.

Commercial potential is expected to emerge when replacing costly existing technologies (like quantum dots) with inexpensive materials able that can be embodied as highly fluorescent organic solids. Such materials are expected to create new value and have commercial potential in several markets in which either aesthetics, brightness, or color transmission is critical for performance. Our primary markets of interest are colorants in paints and polymers. Fluorescent brighteners represent an important segment of the global dyes and pigments market (a >$30B per year industry). We believe our technology can expand this segment by streamlining the formulation and processing of fluorescent materials, and by broadening the available color palate. Immediate applications would arise in creation of new fluorescent paints and coatings for construction and safety applications, and may also provide new user-friendly color options to the growing market for 3D printing materials. We anticipate additional downstream applications to arise in customized biolabeling technologies and solar power generation. If successful, the broader impacts also include the training of scientists in the process of commercialization. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project provides a universal tool to address the outstanding intellectual challenge of understanding how to reverse loss of fluorescence from solid-state formulations of organic dyes. The intellectual merits will derive from new synthetic preparations of fluorescent dye and pigment technology by a method called small molecule isolation lattices, or SMILES. This project derives from research that has provided a way to insulate the color-carrying dye molecules from one another allowing their fluorescence to be rescued.

Manufacturing cell therapies requires expensive reagents and facilities and highly skilled labor, which drives up healthcare costs and makes cell therapies unattainable for many patients in greatest need. This I-Corps project aims to revolutionize the field of cell therapy manufacturing with an innovatively low-cost cell processing technology. This approach can efficiently modify normal cells into potent cell therapies and isolate desired cell populations for quality control. It benefits from low cost operation and eliminates the need in expensive skilled personal. This technology has a great potential to usher in a new era of affordable cell therapies and cost-effective healthcare.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes a microfluidic platform that can sort and engineer cells with little to no impact on cell viability and function. Instead of relying on expensive and dangerous methods such as viruses or electric shock, the approach relies on natural cell response to rapid compressions to cause the processed cells to uptake molecules that can turn cells into life-saving cell therapies. This uptake can also be used to deliver labels to the cell interior to indicate desirable or undesirable cell traits for an easy and rapid readout for quality control. The entire technology is housed on a microfluidic chip that can process over 100,000 cells per second. The technology for cell sorting makes use of inherent cell mechanical properties and does not require any additional chemical or biological cell modification.

Grid-weak regions and island communities typically have poor access to affordable, resilient, and clean energy solutions compared to their mainland counterparts. The frequency and severity of natural disasters is increasing; resilient and flexible electricity supply systems are more critical than ever, especially for island communities. Making effective recovery decisions addresses the different strategies of preparedness for energy systems and can drastically improve resulting economic and community impacts. This project will enable the efficient transmission of energy to island communities through a new technology, mobile energy storage transmission (MEST). The recent improvements of energy storage technology cost, size, and performance have resulted in technoeconomic feasibility of this innovative technology. Implementation of MEST will both improve long-term energy access for island communities and provide rapidly-deployable, flexible, affordable, and resilient electricity delivery systems for short-term crises. The advent of MEST coincides with the increasing importance of island energy systems; a market earmarked for high-growth over coming decades as sea levels rise, island nations continue to develop, and emphasis is put on development of sustainable energy systems.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on findings which identified a significant challenge in addressing the interdependency between infrastructure systems, in particular, pertaining to the role that energy systems play in the disaster recovery process of other infrastructures and communities. The proposed investigation addresses a missing link between resilience of infrastructure networks and multi-industry impacts to more effectively guide preparedness and recovery decisions. This project will evaluate scenario-specific applications of MEST for island communities; complementing the shortcomings of conventional cabled transmission. While on-shore cabled transmission is an efficient and low-cost mode of transporting electricity, subsea cabled transmission is costly and often results in poor redundancy of electricity supply. This novel transmission model, comprised of commercially available components, uses batteries and conventional freight transportation to move electricity from one market to another; providing service commensurate to a subsea cabled interconnector, but with added flexibility, resilience, and many benefits of traditional grid-level energy storage systems. MEST is founded on established economic theory, energy storage technology, and various market data. Research indicates potential for MEST in both long-term island power provision and short-term disaster relief. The combination of these findings indicates a promising future for impact and commercialization of MEST following this I-Corps project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Resource Enhancement and Advanced Discovery System (READS) technology streamlines users approaches to locating the most relevant analytic tools for their specific problems through natural language capabilities.  While focusing on geoscientists, financial analysts, and biotechnologists as potential users at the inception of this I-Corps project, READS can be customized for any discipline and its specific data analytic tool requirements.  The three user examples listed above are only the beginning of the potential applications for which this analytic tool discovery system can be utilized.  The ability to query resources with discipline-specific language and increase result accuracy by annotating the queried resources with domain-specific terminology will drastically reduce the amount of time required to locate requisite tools, and ultimately attract users.  New users will not need to start from scratch in their analyses, but will be able to build upon the resources discovered by others, therefore maximizing productivity.  This broad range of appeal, combined with an accessible user interface not seen in other tools, underscores the potential for significant commercial impact of this technology.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project   aims to assist users in easily locating the ""best"" analytic tools for their specific task through an analytic tool discovery system for interdisciplinary data analysis. Data manipulation challenges are emerging and the integration of dataset analytic tools into a comprehensive framework is needed to further knowledge discovery.  Abundant tools and methods are available to the research and business communities to analyze datasets across disciplines, but it is often difficult to locate the most relevant tools for a specific task. Adding context to queries greatly enhances a users' ability to retrieve requisite analytic tools.  READS integrates analytic tool information into a one-stop-shop retrieval system capable of accessing valuable metadata from multiple repositories.  The system allows end-users to retrieve analytic tool information by submitting either keyword-based queries and/or free text-based questions.  The system leverages natural language processing, text mining, and an ontology-based metadata annotation system to allow collections of analytic tools and methods to be linked and discovered with high accuracy.  This allows end-users to discover, reuse, validate, share, and exchange knowledge related to their chosen data analytic tools. This novel approach facilitates the accessible analysis of cross-domain datasets, greatly enhancing end-users' ability to more efficiently answer challenging questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our movement patterns must be constantly adapted as we grow, age, or experience changing conditions such as slippery sidewalks. Learning new motor skills initiates a process of memory formation that generated improved and more stable performance. Previously learned motor memories can also be used to learn another motor task more rapidly. The goal of this project is to reveal how the human brain creates and recalls memories in walking. This will be achieved by studying a set of tasks inspired by research of arm control. The expected findings will have broad implications for human walking flexibility in health and disease, because motor learning and rehabilitation are thought to share similar mechanisms. The advanced scientific knowledge will have broader impacts, including the possible transformation of gait rehabilitation approaches and enhanced understanding of learning and memory in the human brain. Further, this work includes interdisciplinary neuroscience training of promising students with diverse ethnic, gender, and academic backgrounds.<br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER proposal is to understand the mechanisms for human locomotor adaptation and learning. While motor learning has received ample attention in studies utilizing upper limbs, there are relatively few studies of motor learning in the context of human locomotion. These experiments will examine the commonalities as well as task-specific distinctions across different types of locomotor learning paradigms: sequence learning, visuomotor adaptation and dynamic (split-belt treadmill) adaptation. Specifically, this work will examine how consolidation leads to offline learning and resistance to interferences between different walking patterns, and the immediate and delayed benefits of variable practice on the generalization of learning. This research will also examine the role of sleep in consolidation and generalization of locomotor learning. The integrated educational plan will provide interdisciplinary neuroscience training to undergraduate and graduate students in order to develop and retain young scientists in the area of movement neuroscience. The project will promote active participation from underrepresented students in order to equip women and minorities to pursue STEM education.

Fully Autonomous Vehicles (AV) will reduce traffic collisions and enable humans to spend less time driving and more time on productive activities. Commercially deploying AVs requires a number of key technologies including sensing, perceptual systems, motion planning, and actuation. Our discussions with leaders and decisionmakers at automotive companies have shown that the development of robust, accurate, and energy-efficient perception systems is a major technical obstacle to creating mass-producible autonomous road vehicles. Of particular interest to automakers is scaling down the computational requirements of perceptual systems while preserving high levels of accuracy and robustness.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use deep learning to create perception systems that are (a) scalable across different computational platforms and (b) scalable across smaller or larger sensor sets.

Measurements of radiocarbon in natural samples provide a unique and powerful set of tools for ocean and earth science. The 14C half-life (time it takes for half of the atoms in a sample to decay) of 5700 years can be used to date carbon-bearing samples as old as 50,000 years, and to study the time scales of ocean circulation and mixing, the timing of climate changes, and the details of modern carbon cycling. Radiocarbon measurements are used in many branches of ocean research including physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, paleooceanography, and climate change. The research enabled by the NOSAMS measurements addresses questions that are important to society: among them issues of past and future global climate change, local and regional environmental impacts, and the development of natural resources. In addition to supporting socially relevant research, NOSAMS will play an important role in training and mentorship of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. NOSAMS promotes general public understanding of radiocarbon and related scientific issues through web sites and in hosting tours for the visiting public.<br/><br/><br/>The Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF provides base support for the operation and maintenance of the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (NOSAMS) facility. The facility provides natural level radiocarbon dating services to the oceanographic community. Radiocarbon is an important tool in climate, carbon cycle, and biogeochemical science. It is useful as a chronometer covering the past ~50,000 years, it is a diagnostic of past changes in the carbon cycle, it serves as a tracer of ocean circulation, and it is a probe for carbon flow in the environment. Thus radiocarbon measurements are used in many sectors of ocean science research ranging from paleoceanography, physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, and climate change science. Current environmental level radiocarbon measurements require careful sample processing that minimizes contamination risk and other experimental artifacts, and the use of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) systems. Consequently, it is advantageous to have and maintain a central facility that serves the broader ocean sciences community by making such measurements and acting as a center of expertise, as well as sustaining and advancing the state-of-the-art in such measurements. The PI?s propose to continue operations for another five years, while gradually increasing the numbers of samples analyzed each year, improving the accuracy and precision of measurements, and expanding the methodology in new directions. They also plan to continue to improve and develop new radiocarbon measurement capabilities and propose to expand the portfolio of services offered to the community. Recent advances include pioneering innovative techniques such as the REDICS (Rapid Extraction of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon System) and the Ramped Pyrolysis System, both of which allow NOSAMS to maintain its competitive edge. Proposed research includes new inroads into compound specific and compound class radiocarbon analysis, as well as extending analyses to smaller samples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses.

Over the course of this five-year project, twenty-eight students will receive two-year scholarships and eight students will receive three-year scholarships. This project aims to discuss the growing need for chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical engineers. In Tennessee and elsewhere, engineering transfer students often arrive at four-year institutions with many community college credits, but without the prerequisites needed to take junior-level or major-specific courses. As a result, transfer students may need four more years in college to complete the classes needed for graduation, decreasing the likelihood that they will complete an engineering degree. The aim of this project is to ensure that transfer students complete their UTC studies within two years after transferring from a community college. The plan incorporates mentorship, summer coursework, and summer boot camps to ensure a successful transition. A Transfer Learning Community will provide students with a peer support system and help them adjust to university life and overcome academic challenges. A local advisory board for regional schools will help to coordinate curricula among the schools. The project's emphasis on faculty mentoring will help the project have a lasting impact on UTC practices. The project also has the potential for positive impact on the local community through strengthened industry ties and employment opportunities. This project is significant in its potential to find and give best practices to guide four-year institutions across the nation to support the success of transfer students. <br/><br/>The project will use a mixed methods study to compare quantitative and qualitative data gathered for scholars versus non-scholar transfer students, non-transfer students, and matched non-scholar transfer students. The study will investigate five research questions: (1) Does taking part in the Summer Boot Camp improve transfer students' academic performance and likelihood of matriculation? (2) Does regular participation in peer tutoring increase transfer students' academic performance and likelihood of matriculation? (3) Which activities most reduce ""transfer shock"" among scholars? (4) Which activities most improve career placement following graduation? (5) How does the academic preparation affect a student's likelihood of retention and on-time graduation? Information from this research study may increase understanding of interventions, such as learning communities, in improving the academic performance, retention rates and time to graduation for scholars compared to non-scholars.

The exhaustion of oil and gas supplies is ever growing near, and the negative environmental impacts caused from these energy sources is of great concern. Solar power is an excellent alternative energy source, but the technology involved can be costly. This project's solar cell embedded coating is substantially cheaper than traditional solar panels and can be implemented onto structures where solar panels would not be feasible.

The perovskite material is tin based, as opposed to the traditional, toxic lead-based variety. The lifetime of the perovskites is extended by the elimination of oxidation through encapsulating the perovskite solar cells at the atomic layer through our proprietary carbon bonding nanotechnology. These perovskite solar cells can be embedded into a coating to add solar energy capabilities to other materials. This technology expands the frontiers of nanoscience to address several core academic challenges: expanding the use of graphitic nanosystems into functional materials, developing alternative technologies to make solar power the dominant source of commercial energy in the United States, and providing skills of delivering this intellectual property into the marketplace through the I-Corps program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected to gather information about self-efficacy and the value and cost of education of participating students, especially veterans. The lessons learned in this study will be relevant to other institutions of higher learning, and military services may be able to use these findings to better prepare service members as they transition from military service to higher education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymer foams are an important component of many modern technologies from construction to automotive as well as packaging and sporting goods.  Non-sustainable structural foam is a $350 billion/year market comprised mainly of polyurethane and polystyrene (styrofoam). Polyurethane and polystyrene require 500 years to degrade and create 30% of land-fill waste. It has been predicted that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. Natural materials are an attractive alternative for producing polymer foams, but often they lack the required mechanical properties or appropriate processing. Our technology transforms the biopolymer, chitin, contained in seafood waste into foam using a water-based environmentally friendly process. The resulting natural foam is less costly to produce and closely matches the properties of polystyrene and polyurethane foams.<br/><br/><br/>This I-Corps project will examine costumer discovery data from potential customers in various structural foam markets to find the best market fit and identify the unfulfilled needs for sustainable structural foam. During the regional I-Corps course, we completed interviews with surfboard shapers, surfboard manufacturers, professional surfers, and other sustainable industry experts related to surfboards who have validated the value of having sustainable and biodegradable foam for use as the core material in surfboard construction. We plan to further explore other potential industrial applications for our sustainable and biodegradable foam. We will interview project and business managers from innovation research departments within industries such as packaging, transportation, and construction to determine product-market fit for these applications. The goal being to find the best fit for the technology in the global polymer foams market.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, the Preparing and Mentoring Middle Grades STEM Educators to Teach in High-Need South Carolina School Districts project is recruiting career changers from STEM fields and preparing them to become middle grades STEM teachers. The project is funding 40 scholarships over 4 years. In this project, Clemson University is collaborating with Greenville County Public Schools. Recipients will be enrolled in a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program that includes initial teacher certification for Middle Grades Education. The Noyce Scholarships will expand opportunities for STEM career changers to complete the MAT program and hence also expand the number of middle grades STEM teachers in the state.<br/><br/>The project will investigate the impact of the Noyce Program by analyzing 16 years of data from the Clemson MAT in middle grades program, which has enrolled more than 250 individuals, 86 of whom have been or will be Noyce Scholars. Research questions include: (1) How do teacher efficacy and other personal characteristic affect teacher retention and success among STEM instructors? (2) Do STEM career changers possess different characteristics than STEM majors who come directly out of undergraduate majors? (3) How does the performance of the students of Noyce Scholars and non-Noyce-Scholars compare? (4) How does the performance of the students of STEM majors and non-STEM majors compare?

Specifically, the return of oceanic crust to the mantle creates chemical and mineralogical heterogeneities (mixtures of olivine-rich and pyroxene-rich lithologies) that can lead to complex melting behavior when this material rises again beneath spreading centers and in mantle plumes.  The abundance and time scales of crustal recycling are important aspects of the plate tectonic cycle, but difficult to constrain based solely on the petrology and geochemistry of crustal rocks.  Quantitative modeling requires knowledge of melting behavior of different rock types.  The goal of this research is to obtain new high quality experimental data on the melting of pyroxenite, which represents one the most important rock types that are recycled into the mantle.  Experiments will be performed at conditions found in the mantle where temperatures are thousands of degrees hotter and pressures tens of thousands of times greater than found at the Earth's surface. The results obtained will be integrated into forward models of melting of heterogeneous mantle that simulate the dynamic processes operating beneath the world's spreading centers and in mantle plumes.  <br/><br/>The primary objective of this project is to understand the effect of near-fractional melting of pyroxenites, to better quantify the role of pyroxenite in basalt genesis. The experimental approach will consist of performing incremental melting experiments, with increments of melt fraction less than 5 wt. % at each stage, on three different compositions previously investigated by batch melting experiments. The selected compositions span the likely compositional range of pyroxenite lithologies in the mantle. Melt composition at each temperature increment will be determined with the microdike technique and used to define new melting parameterizations that can be used to model near-fractional melting and integrate them into forward models of melting of heterogeneous mantle. NiO and MnO proxies used to determine the pyroxenite contribution in typical basaltic magmas and their source regions will be recalibrated based on the experimental results. Because melt extraction during generation of MORB and ocean island basalts is likely to occur via near fractional melting rather than batch melting, these new calibrations will allow us to better quantify the proportion of pyroxenite in the mantle source of the most abundant magmas on Earth."

Electric transmission and distribution facilities, as well as residential wiring and appliances, account for background magnetic fields in the home. In homes not located near high-voltage power cables, this background field is small but directly beneath the power cables, the fields are much stronger. This background magnetic field can be converted into useful electricity by using the principle of magneto-mechano-electric conversion. Generated electricity can be stored into supercapacitor or rechargeable battery and used for various purposes such as powering sensors and mobile devices. The project will utilize piezoelectric - piezomagnetic materials that are coupled together in a laminate composite structure to provide conversion of magnetic field into electric field. As a demonstration, the project will target powering wireless sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle flying over the power transmission lines. Several fundamental advances will be made in optimizing the energy conversion process including (i) design of the composite structure that results in magnetic flux amplification and reduction of demagnetization field within given shape and volume, (ii) understanding of the physical interactions occurring at varying length scales and addressing them in design of energy converter, (iii) full system modeling to reveal the role of materials, structure, and electrical variables and using the model to improve the system efficiency. These advancements in describing the dynamic magnetic field energy conversion process from sources such as power transmission cables, household appliances, and residential wiring will provide opportunity for developing new generation of wireless power sources. The knowledge generated from the project will be summarized into interdisciplinary web-based tutorial which will be offered to public through Energy Harvesting Society website.

Over the next decade the goal is to build HPC parallel system capable of extreme-scale performance (one exaflop (1018)operations per second) and processing exabyte (1018) of data. However, one of the biggest challenges of achieving extreme-scale performance is what is known as the hardware memory wall, which is about the growing gap between the speed of computation performed by CPU and the speed of supplying data to the CPU from memory systems (about x100 time slower). The low performance efficiency of modern HPC system (average <60% and could be as low as 5%) manifests the memory wall impact since a huge amount of computation cycles are wasted for waiting for the arrival of input data.  It becomes very critical to create effective software solutions for achieving the computation potential of hardware and for improving the efficiency and usability of the existing and future computing system. Such solutions will significantly benefit a broad range of disciplines that use parallel computers to solve scientific and engineering problems, and accelerate scientific discovery and problem solving to improve quality of life of the society. <br/>This CAREER project develops innovative software techniques to address the programming and performance challenges of the existing and emerging memory systems: 1) a portable abstract machine model for programming, compiling and executing parallel applications, 2) new programming interface and model for data mapping, movement, and consistency, and 3) machine-aware compilation and data-aware scheduling techniques to realize an asynchronous task flow execution model to hide the latency of data movement. It addresses the memory wall challenge by developing a memory-centric programming paradigm for helping achieve extreme-scale performance of parallel applications with minimum impairment to programmability.

Dudley of Florida State University to develop new methods for the synthesis and strategic application of alkynes. The alkyne functional group is becoming increasingly prominent as chemists place greater emphasis on conservation (atom economy), efficiency (step economy), and simplicity (click chemistry). New methods for alkyne synthesis are needed to fuel the growth of modern alkyne chemistry. The research efforts at Florida State University will focus on de novo creation of CC triple bonds by fragmentation, retro-cycloaddition, and other entropically favorable processes. Special emphasis will be placed on the synthesis of alkynes that are needed for specific applications in the molecular sciences but that cannot be prepared by direct substitution of acetylene. Strategic applications of the resulting alkynes will be developed as an integral part of the research process, including the chemical synthesis of bioactive natural products and of strained cycloalkynes of relevance to bioorthogonal chemistry. The strained cycloalkynes will be designed and evaluated in collaboration with the co PI, Prof. Igor Alabugin of Florida State University.<br/><br/>Alkynes are high energy hydrocarbons containing triple bonds.  The impact of alkyne chemistry transcends traditional boundaries of chemical synthesis. Alkyne chemical reactions are instrumental to many techniques in bioimaging, pharmaceutical synthesis, advanced materials research, etc. These techniques therefore depend on convenient access to the requisite alkynes. The proposed research is expected to lead to more efficient production of high-value alkynes and to a better fundamental understanding of alkyne reactivity. This research program is fully integrated with university education efforts. The organic methodology and synthesis research opportunities associated with this project will prepare student participants to excel in an innovation-based economy. Science communication is an important part of this preparation. In addition to disseminating research results to the scientific community, program participants communicate broadly with the public, including K-12 students, through various outreach programs. These programs target local and global audiences to promote awareness of the increasingly global, diverse, and multidisciplinary chemical sciences."

However, the bandwidth between processors and off-chip memory has not increased due to various stringent physical constraints. Besides, data transfers between the processors and the off-chip memory consume orders of magnitude more energy than on-chip computation due to the disparity between interconnection and transistor scaling.<br/><br/>Exploiting recent 3D-stacking technology, the researcher community has explored near-data processing architectures that place processors and memory on the same chip.

For the mathematics education community, computing offers an application of mathematics concepts that may strengthen teachers' and students' mathematical understanding; for the computer science (CS) education community, integration enables equitable access to computing education for all students; for state boards and districts, integration accommodates staffing and curricular constraints while targeting core learning objectives in multiple disciplines. Bootstrap is a nationally-deployed curriculum that integrates computer science and algebra. Bootstrap's current professional development (PD) program for math teachers is a 3-day in-person event which assumes that teachers are somewhat facile with algebraic functions. Both Bootstrap and the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)  have observed that some teachers have a weak command of functions. School districts would prefer a shorter in-person PD to reduce staffing costs and increase flexibility. This project will use a hybrid PD model to address both needs. Simultaneously, the project will research ways to tailor the online content to be effective for teachers who differ in their understanding of functions, goals for pursuing PD, and interest in mathematics, computing, math/CS integration, and student thinking. This Researcher-Practitioner Partnership team includes Bootstrap; NCTM (specifically its Math Forum team, which has expertise in on-line training); Brown University; Swarthmore College; the Oklahoma State Division of Secondary Mathematics and Computing Education and school districts in Texas. A total of 270 middle-school math teachers---a majority from rural areas or serving Native American or Hispanic students in our partnering regions---will participate in Bootstrap PD under this project. Assuming typical adoption rates, these teachers should reach 6,000 students within the project period alone. Building Bootstrap content into the Math Forum will expose thousands of NCTM's teachers to the potential of integrated math/CS curricula.<br/><br/> The team will use design-based research to develop and deploy a hybrid PD model and online support community for Bootstrap teachers, augment Bootstrap PD to reinforce teachers' understanding of algebraic functions, and conduct quasi-experimental studies to inform the design of different pathways through the PD. This project will study how to develop teachers' understanding of CS while also strengthening their math proficiency. In particular, the project will explore the possibilities for CS to improve teachers' understanding of algebraic functions. The project also will study ways in which teachers' interest can be made visible and useful in improving engagement and learning in integrated CS and mathematics PD. The results should apply to integrative programs beyond Bootstrap, suggesting strategies to tailor PD to serve more teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This largely land-based classification system has been very useful in conducting research and understanding the environmental, geological, and biological features of those regions. These factors influence how ecological systems within the biome are structured and how they function. The classification scheme provides a framework for site- specific research to be understood in a larger regional context and scale the results to the larger region. A weakness or missing part of this framework is streams and rivers. Most maps or lists of biomes of the world would suggest that flowing waters are so similar to one another that all streams can be lumped into a single category. They are generally lumped together regardless of the regional geology, watershed vegetation, or climatic factors. This research will develop a biome classification system for streams to better understand how streams function and provide an ability to predict how streams will change from human and environmental factors.<br/><br/>This continental scale project will address the deceptively simple question: is there such a thing as a stream biome? From an ecosystem perspective we now know that inland waters play critical roles in both global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. The physical diversity of lotic waters as well as their tendency is more temporally dynamic than terrestrial systems. Ultimately the phenology of stream ecosystem energetics will be a function of energy supply (light and fixed terrestrial carbon) and fixed carbon removal (via hydrologic disturbance). Watershed structure determines the route and rate at which water enters stream channels while watershed vegetation determines the magnitude and timing of fixed carbon inputs and the degree and temporal patterning of light availability. This research effort will increase the measurements of annual metabolism by nearly two orders of magnitude. At the present time there exist only two streams for which annual metabolic rates have been calculated using continuous dissolved oxygen measurements. By the conclusion of this project 55 years of high quality metabolism data will have been generated for a total of 35 streams, and the project PIs will have acquired (via leveraged funds and collaborations) metabolism data for at least 196 additional streams. Metabolism metrics from all of these streams will be used to build the first hierarchical classification of stream ecosystems based on their seasonal and annual patterns of primary productivity and ecosystem respiration. Stream biome delineation will facilitate estimation of stream metabolic rates at timescales of days to years for spatial scales from reaches to river networks. Simulation models, developed from first principles and refined with empirical data specific to each biome, will forecast changes in metabolic rates in response to likely climate and land use change scenarios. The data management plan has been designed in collaboration with informatics staff of the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics and USGS has agreed to host and help develop a public data repository, modeling, and data visualization platform specifically designed to collate long-term or high-resolution metabolism and dissolved oxygen datasets for streams. By building, refining and activating a community data platform this research program will change the way individual streams are studied and will facilitate and encourage near instantaneous cross-site synthesis. In addition to capacity building, this project will directly support seven graduate students and 7 postdoctoral associates over the funding period."

Whether unusual soil ecosystems respond differently to climate change compared to ?normal? soil types is unknown. On the one hand, stress-tolerant plant traits typical of unusual soil flora may result in greater resilience to climate change. On the other hand, spatial isolation and anthropogenic disturbances, like habitat fragmentation, may make unusual soil ecosystems more vulnerable to climate change. This project will use a combination of field measurements, remote sensing, and climate modeling to determine how serpentine soils in the Caribbean region respond to ongoing and predicted climate change. This research represents the first comprehensive effort to understand how tropical serpentine soils respond to climate change, and consequently will vastly improve our understanding of these unique ecosystems. The information generated by this research will be useful for conserving biodiversity and for improving predictions for other unusual soil ecosystems around the world. The data collected during this project will enhance national and global databases, facilitating further research. This project will strengthen the workforce and increase diversity in science by providing training workshops for students and faculty in data management and analytical skills, integrating the data collected in this research into introductory biology teaching modules, and training four undergraduate and four graduate students in all aspects of the study from data collection to publication.<br/><br/>The proposed research will determine scaling relationships between functional trait diversity and environmental attributes of serpentine and non-serpentine ecosystems, quantify historical patterns and rates of land-use change of serpentine and non-serpentine ecosystems using satellite imagery, and model predicted ecosystem function by integrating soil and functional traits into climate and species distribution models. This project will measure key plant functional traits related to climatic tolerances and dispersal ability in serpentine and non-serpentine ecosystems throughout the Caribbean Basin. Soil chemistry will also be quantified, allowing a standardized comparison of soil characteristics across broad spatial scales. Climate and species distribution models will identify regions and species that are particularly vulnerable or resilient to climate change. Inter-annual trends in vegetation greenness and primary production will be analyzed using Landsat imagery data. Remote sensing analyses will determine the magnitude and rate of habitat fragmentation in serpentine and non-serpentine ecosystems and responses to inter-annual variation in precipitation.

Replacing non-sustainable and strategically undesirable rare-earth elements is one of the most critical challenges. This CAREER project investigates rare-earth-free alloy nanomagnets for high energy density, based exclusively on traditional elements Fe, Co and Ni. The success of this project removes environmentally non-sustainable rare-earth implementations, promotes emerging green energy technologies, and establishes U.S. leadership in rare-earth-free magnet development. The project integrates energy-critical nanometal research with education and outreach at the exciting interface of materials science and sustainable nanotechnologies, which encourage underrepresented minorities to pursue unique cutting-edge magnetic material training, and fosters the public awareness of transformative magnetic nanotechnology in sustainability and green energy. Similar opportunities are designed for high-school science teachers, in part to help them be better equipped for advising high school students about science-based careers.<br/><br/>Technical Summary: <br/>This CAREER project aims to address a key challenge of sustainable rare-earth-free metallic nanostructures: the energy density of all ferrous alloy nanomagnets is dictated chiefly by the precise control of their metastable tetragonal structural properties and dopant distribution on the atomic scale. The research objective of this project is to understand basic parameters that govern synthesis, doping and self-assembly of tetragonal ferrous alloys and to explore their unique exchange-coupling properties for high energy density nanomagnets. The project is comprised of the following interrelated activities: (1) synthesis of tetragonal iron-cobalt nanostructures using phase transformations, (2) exploring the doping and order-disorder transition of single domain iron-nickel using chemical transformation and interfacial diffusion alloying, and (3) exchange-coupling of magnetically hard and soft ferrous nanocomposites to achieve high energy density rare-earth-free nanomagnets. Beyond the local and regional educational benefits, the research entails a major benefit to society in that successful results could lead to the revolution of rare-earth-free permanent magnets and contribute to green energy technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compared with the widely used Monte Carlo approach, the algorithm under development will be able to more accurately capture complicated solution structures in long-time simulations. Moreover, physically conserved quantities such as mass, momentum, and energy can be exactly preserved at the discrete level. The new algorithm also has the potential to be extended to a broader class of applications such as plasma physics, astrophysics, and semi-conductor device simulation.  Students will be trained through involvement in the research project.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a very high order mesh-based multi-scale numerical approach to modeling rarified gas dynamics between the kinetic and hydrodynamic regimes. The approach is based on the so-called micro-macro formulation of the kinetic equation, which involves a natural decomposition of the problem into equilibrium and non-equilibrium parts. The high order spatial accuracy is achieved by a nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element approach, and the high order temporal accuracy is achieved by globally stiffly accurate implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods.  Due to deliberate design and considerations of the hydrodynamic asymptotics, the scheme under development becomes a DG method with explicit RK time discretizations for the Euler system in the zero limit of the Knudsen number, and a local DG discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations for a simplified BGK collision operator in a formal asymptotic analysis. Such a local DG method is similar in spirit to classical approaches based on a mixed formulation of the equations. The new scheme will be tested on problems at kinetic-hydrodynamic scales and compared with the results from the simplified BGK model, its ellipsoidal statistical (ES-BGK) extension, as well as with results from the macroscopic hydrodynamic models. The project will also study numerically the boundary layer for kinetic simulations when a diffusive hydrodynamic limit is considered."

Four cohesive research thrusts are proposed to develop: (i) a unified analytical framework to characterize the impact conditions of measurement attacks on the large-scale, dynamic power grid. (ii) methods to identify coordinated measurement attacks that are launched from non-collusive groups, (iii) fast and accurate detection algorithms considering critical response time of the grid, and (iv) defense strategies at multiple levels of the grid to deter repetitive attacks at critical targets.

It will address important challenges of identifying attack goals and intercepting potential threats in realistic settings. This framework will not only enable us to develop more effective defense mechanisms for the power grid, but also bring important insights of cyber-physical causal chains in dynamic systems to other research communities. This project is also among the few that unify the cyber-protection capabilities and grid context information with system-theoretic approaches. It will result in algorithmic tools that integrate the defense efforts on multiple levels of the grid, vertically enhancing grid security while reducing the overall defense cost.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will entailer transformative impact through real-world applications in the power industry and extensive educational initiatives at Ohio State University (OSU) and Washington State University (WSU). Both PIs have strong collaborations with power utilities, power technology companies, and national laboratories, which will facilitate the dissemination of research outcomes into security solutions based on real-world requirements.

The piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to an applied mechanical stress.  Piezoelectric ceramics are important because they play critical role in daily use devices including automobiles, aircrafts, medical instruments, food processing, and house-hold electronics. This project will result in scale-up of the manufacturing process of a particular type of piezoelectric ceramic: textured piezoelectric ceramics. Textured ceramics have the following unique features: three-to-five times higher transduction coefficients, thermal stability over high temperatures, and mechanical robustness as compared to randomly oriented polycrystalline ceramics.These features provide the following advantages: higher efficiency, resolution, cost savings, miniaturization, and power density. Textured ceramics can be synthesized using the same process as that established for random ceramics and thus do not require any new tooling or equipment.<br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The sintering stages in achieving textured ceramics will be analyzed to identify the challenges associated with scaling the manufacturing process to ensure consistent production. This includes establishing the process for synthesizing the seeds in large quantities with adequate morphology and dimension, and tailoring the binder-burnout and sintering profiles. The effect of processing variables that play a deterministic role in achieving the large grain brick-wall like microstructure will be evaluated. Matrix/seed template interfaces in the microstructure will be investigated using high resolution microscopy to understand the nature of domain wall motion with applied electric field. This, in turn, will provide assessment of the processes controlling the mechanical and electrical aging behavior. In conjunction with the time-temperature dependent sintering studies, the field-stress dependent domain migration studies will provide a full understanding of the electromechanical behavior of the textured ceramics. <br/><br/>In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through Virginia Tech's Catalyst program, KnowledgeWorks entrepreneurship events, participation in the Nexus Conference, and participation in the iScholars program.<br/><br/>The project engagesHarris Corporation, Prime Photonics, and the Virginia Tech Intellectual Property Office to augment the team's research capability, provide access to industrial testing and manufacturing environment, and guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality."

The objective of this project is to develop a systematic framework for designing extensible cyber-physical systems that can enable efficient and correct updates with minimal redesign and re-verification efforts. The intellectual merits are (1) a new and unified framework that optimizes system extensibility by addressing both functional correctness and platform feasibility, and (2) new algorithms for functional verification with platform consideration, software architecture synthesis driven by extensibility metrics, and integration of verification and synthesis for joint design space exploration. The project?s broader significance and importance are (1) enabling engineers to cope with continual changes in cyber-physical design components or operating conditions, thereby significantly reducing redesign and re-verification cost, (2) providing a general framework for designing extensible systems that is applicable to a wide range of systems including robotic, automotive, and avionic systems, and (3) providing new methodologies and techniques that facilitate the training of undergraduate and graduate students to meet the design challenges of cyber-physical systems.<br/><br/>Many cyber-physical systems today are one-off designs -- systems designed without future changes in mind. The proposed extensibility-driven design (EDD) framework treats extensibility as a first-class design objective and addresses it with a holistic consideration of functional properties and platform implementation. An EDD design flow provides the following capabilities. At the initial design stage, EDD identifies certain constraints (e.g., timing) that are critical for functional correctness, and explores the design space to maximize the amount of future software and hardware changes that can be made without violating these constraints. During design updates, EDD first determines whether it is possible to accommodate the updates through software architecture re-synthesis, so as to avoid costly re-verification. In the cases where the updates violate existing platform constraints and requirements, EDD selectively modifies some of them to explore feasible changes while minimizing re-verification efforts."

This research program will elucidate structural parameters and guiding principles to direct fabrication of supramolecular IPNs with tunable interfacial interactions, tailored structural heterogeneity, and synergistic mechanical behavior. Three classes of supramolecular IPNs will be explored that utilize: (1) complementary and orthogonal supramolecular associations with focus on how motifs of varying interaction strength/organization influence microstructure development and dynamics, (2) self-complementary and complementary hydrogen bonding associations with an emphasis on the correlation between the resulting IPN morphology, mechanics, and supramolecular response, and (3) particulate-reinforcement as an approach to control phase coarsening, mechanical behavior, and functionality.

Ratios and proportional relationships are a critical foundation for mathematics and science, yet they pose perennial challenges for students and teachers. Investigating Proportional Relationships from Two Perspectives (InPReP2) will examine how future teachers develop understandings of proportional relationships in mathematics courses they take as part of their preparation programs. The project will collect data in teacher preparation courses and through interviews during which future teachers solve problems about proportional relationships. The courses and interviews will be based on a potentially transformative approach to ratio and proportional relationships, which has been overlooked by past research. The project will also conduct a study comparing how preservice middle grades and secondary grades mathematics teachers at the University of Georgia (UGA) and Kennesaw State University (KSU) reason about proportional relationships. Discoveries about what is easier and what is harder for future teachers to learn will be used to identify key targets for instruction that better prepare future teachers to help their students with critical, yet difficult, middle grades mathematics. <br/><br/>Past research suggests teachers' difficulties with proportional relationships, covariation, and multiplicative relationships are likely to have roots deep in the multiplicative conceptual field, yet this same research has not examined those roots directly. InPReP2 will examine how preservice middle school teachers' capacities to reason about multiplication and division in terms of quantities support and constrain their facility with proportional relationships. InPReP2 will also investigate proportional relationships based on two complementary perspectives, one that makes covariation visually explicit with double number lines and one that makes multiplicative relationships between quantities visually explicit with strip diagrams. The central hypothesis for InPReP2 is that the two perspectives may facilitate both key features of proportional relationships and open new pathways that make subsequent topics more accessible. InPReP2 will investigate methods that coordinate detailed case studies with recent advances surveying multiplicative reasoning in large, national samples. InPReP2 will also examine in both clinical and experimental settings how different initial strengths and weaknesses with multiplicative reasoning affect how future teachers make sense of the two perspectives on proportions and applications. InPReP2 results about multiplicative reasoning will inform improved teacher education and professional development content courses that prepare teachers across the nation for standards that emphasize sense making with quantities. Teachers with an understanding of proportional relationships in terms of quantities will be better prepared to support their students' reasoning about co-variation and multiplicative relationships, which is fundamental to college readiness. InPReP2 methods will advance STEM education research by investigating how Diagnostic Classification Models, in combination with measures of reasoning, can be used to coordinate surveys of large samples with detailed case-studies of small samples. Such methods have broad implications for generating generalizable findings about learning in complex, multi-faceted domains.

In all organisms, gene expression is controlled, or regulated, by crosstalk between proteins called transcription factors and specific small regions in the DNA that bind the transcription factors (transcription factor binding sites.)  A key to understanding this crosstalk is learning the precise nature of the ""regulatory vocabulary"" of transcription factor binding sites which potentially varies among organisms.  This project will focus on deciphering the regulatory language in multiple species of the single-celled protozoan Paramecium, a well-established model system in cell biology. The overall project will advance the formal training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, while also establishing a set of molecular resources for the international research community. Specific efforts are being made to organize and integrate all genomic and gene-expression results into a web repository that will allow users to readily query data for dozens of Paramecium species to acquire information about status and evolutionary history of all known genes. The scientific and training results from this project will help promote the growth of the field of evolutionary cell biology, thereby broadening our understanding of the diversity of cellular functions across the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>Much of biological diversity owes its origin to gene duplication and modifications in gene regulatory patterns.  The Paramecium system is well-suited to studying the impacts of gene duplication because the evolution of this genus included two complete-genome duplications that led to the establishment of a clade of distantly related but nearly morphologically identical species. This situation is of broad interest because two rounds of genome duplication are also thought to have preceded the emergence and diversification of the major vertebrate lineages. With complete sequences now available for most Paramecium species, and the evolutionary history of each gene known, the next goal is to determine the cellular mechanisms responsible for differential gene expression and the evolutionary mechanisms associated with differential gene survival. Using a set of efficient methods for discovering transcription factor binding sites, this project will elucidate the evolutionary history of the gene-regulation vocabulary over the billion-year history of the genus Paramecium. Comparisons among lineages that did or did not undergo complete-genome duplications will help define the extent to which evolutionary dynamics are altered in the face of massive gene duplication. Paramecium shares some key features with animals, such as harboring a transcriptionally silent germline genome as well as an active somatic nucleus, all within the confines of a single, highly complex cell. Thus, results of these studies in the Paramecium, which is exceptionally easy to manipulate, may shed light on the evolution of regulatory diversity in other organisms that are not as experimentally tractable."

This project addresses the problem of designing smart markets when the solution of a non-trivial computational model has to be consulted to determine the feasibility of a given allocation profile.  Since such a model is not transparent to the market manager, it is often referred to as a ""black-box"" model.

The idea is to allow (at each iteration) a form of self-scheduling by users onto available resources followed by a black-box evaluation of excess capacity, which in turn informs price updates. A key design novelty pertains to the use of different time-scales for pricing (fast) vs. capacity allocation (slow) adjustments. Personalized incentives for each user (in the forms of additional payments or transfers) guarantee that it is a dominant strategy for users to truthfully report their demand throughout the process. Several additional research directions including noisy black-box model and non-convex feasible regions will be considered. Additionally, the application of the smart market designs to electricity markets with high levels of renewable capacity will be considered. If successful, the project will contribute to ensuring that the market dispatch of available resources meets a certain reliability target with highly intermittent nature of renewable output.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, when developing software at the VMM layer, developers often need to interpret the very low level hardware layer state and reconstruct the semantic meanings of the guest operating system events due to the lack of operating system level abstractions.  This semantic gap problem has been a road block for a decade for many VMM level applications such as virtual machine introspection (VMI), malware analysis, and virtual machine management.<br/><br/>This research seeks to design and develop new approaches, practical techniques, and efficient implementations to automatically bridge the semantic gap for VMM layer programs including VMI. In particular, a dual-VM, binary code reuse based framework is formulated and applied to automatically bridge the semantic gap. Such a framework directly enables a large set of legacy utility software to automatically become VMI software. Meanwhile, the research includes developing a set of practical enabling techniques such as memory exclusive kernel version inference, and integrates these techniques with efficient implementations from binary rewriting. The results of this research are to significantly increase the productivity of virtualization software development as well as the security of virtualization software, and also open new opportunities for automated system administration, intrusion detection, and incident response."

Wind-induced damages to construction sites cause substantial losses, disruption, and considerable schedule delays, and thus negatively impact the efficiency of construction projects. Moreover, wind-induced damage caused by equipment, materials or structural elements, for example, originating from construction sites negatively affect neighboring communities, triggering structural damage, serious injuries, and casualties, as well as economic losses. This project will create and validate a new streamlined Imaging-to-Simulation framework to prevent wind hazard events from causing catastrophic damage to construction projects and neighboring communities. This project will benefit our society as it will significantly enhance current windstorm preparedness and mitigation plans, which ultimately promote public safety, property loss reduction, insurance cost reduction, and induce a culture of preparedness for disasters. This multidisciplinary research will help broaden participation of a new generation of young people in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields through integrated research and pedagogical activities.<br/><br/>Using knowledge on potential at-risk construction resources obtained through experimental testing of extreme wind events, this project will partially or fully automatically model the current state of construction sites through machine vision techniques using multimodal visual data obtained from construction workers and camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicles. To perform multi-physics simulation of multiple discrete objects in unstructured construction sites, an impulse-based discrete element method will be conceptualized. This method explicitly accounts for impulse-based dynamics by realizing efficient computing, which enable balancing between significant speed-up and reasonable simulation fidelity. The approach can describe the collective motion of mutually interacting components over time. Component-based vulnerability and impact analysis with 3D Building or Civil Information Models (BIM/CIMs) will then be conducted to generate fundamental and highly specific knowledge on wind-induced damage mechanisms. Finally, the entire system will be validated in real-world construction projects and within a 12-fan Wall of Wind facility that can generate up to hurricane category 5 wind speeds."

A molecular computing system comprises biomolecules, such as DNA strands, which have been designed to detect certain input molecules by binding to them and subsequently to undergo programmed sequences of chemical reactions that serve to compute a logical function based on the observed pattern of input molecules. For example, a molecular system that requires both of its two inputs to be present simultaneously in order to generate an output signal would be referred to as computing a logical ""AND"" function on the two inputs. However, despite recent advances in the field, prospects for direct application of these techniques to solve real-world problems are limited by the lack of robust interfaces between molecular computers and biological and chemical systems. This project will address this limitation by targeting two specific application domains: wide-spectrum chemical sensing and cell surface analysis using molecular logic cascades. The state of the art in molecular computer design, modeling, and implementation will be advanced by an interdisciplinary combination of research by computer scientists, bioengineers, chemists, and computer engineers, and successful completion of the proposed activity will be a significant step towards routine deployment of molecular computers to address real-world problems in chemical and biological sensing.<br/><br/>In this project, molecular circuit architectures that process sensor inputs from chemical sensors and cell-surface analysis reactions will be designed, modeled, and implemented in the laboratory. This will require specific advances in the isolation of aptamers (DNA sequences that exhibit particular binding affinity to one or more target non-nucleic acid molecules) and in their integration into molecular computing systems. In this context, the aptamer will serve as an interface that allows a rationally-designed DNA-based molecular computing system to use small molecules as input signals. Furthermore, computational modeling and simulation will be used to predict and optimize interactions between DNA aptamers and a range of binding targets, and to choose optimal aptamer combinations to produce cross-reactive multi-sensor arrays capable of discriminating between target ligands by effectively projecting the signal into a multi-dimensional aptamer response space. Furthermore, advanced molecular circuit architectures capable of adaptive, bio-inspired behavior, such as dynamic learning and adaptation, will be designed, with a view to future experimental implementations of these features in large-scale molecular computers. This will include research on highly recurrent, bio-inspired information processing networks to extract meaningful responses from potentially non-specific aptamer-based sensors."

These planets have masses equal to or somewhat larger than the Earth's mass, and orbits around their stars that are well ordered. The planets likely formed in or near their present locations. The investigators have proposed a theory called Inside-Out Planet Formation that suggests that high pressure in the inner regions of debris disks forces pebbles, gas, and dust to group together in a ring. When these materials first form a planet, the planet sweeps out leftover pebbles to make an empty space in its orbit around its star. Then, a new ring of pebbles forms outside the planet. This process repeats, creating a system of planets around the parent star. The investigators will study three aspects of the supply of material that forms the planets under this theory: they will look for forces that would interrupt the flow of pebbles and dust in the disk; they will study hydrogen and helium gas addition to these early planets; and finally they will consider magnetic effects on this process. This project serves the national interest by improving our understanding of how planetary systems like our Solar System formed and evolved.

These planets have masses ranging from Earth to super-Earth, and well-aligned orbits. These properties argue for formation near their present locations. The ""Inside-Out Planet Formation"" theory addresses the properties of STIPs. It involves the sequential formation of planets from ""pebble""-rich rings in inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Pebbles, formed from dust coagulation, migrate to the inner disk due to gas drag and collect at a local pressure maximum. Once the first planet forms from the pebble ring, it grows to open a gap. A new pebble ring starts to form exterior to the planet, and the process repeats. The STIP planets have a wide range of densities, implying some are surrounded by H/He atmospheres with up to ~10% of the planet's mass. However, they did not suffer runaway accretion of H/He to become gas giants. This research will investigate three aspects of the supply chain of material to and from the STIP's planets during both their formation and subsequent evolution. First, the investigators will study the radial inward drift of pebbles through the disk plane, focusing on streaming instabilities that could disrupt pebble drift by forming massive planetesimals. Second, they will study H/He gas accretion to terrestrial planets of sub-Earth to super-Earth masses. Third, they will calculate magnetically-regulated atmospheric evaporation rates of STIPs.

Previous models examining the impact of drought on food security have not incorporated food trade and food movements at fine spatial scales, yet these components are critical parts of regional food systems. In sub-Saharan Africa droughts and floods account for approximately 80% of fatalities and 70% of the economic losses that are due to natural hazards. Zambia is particularly vulnerable to droughts, having high levels of malnutrition, poverty, income inequality, exposure to HIV/AIDS and malaria, and low levels of educational attainment. Zambia's agricultural production is rain-fed, which further increases vulnerability in the region. With the extreme vulnerability of the region, Zambia serves as an ideal place to study how the interactions between drought risk, crop production, trade, and policy affect food security. By incorporating the effects of trade and policy into predictive hydrological and agricultural models, this project is improving existing early warning systems for famine which rarely assess the capacity for a region to ameliorate drought via food transfers and trade.  <br/>   <br/>This project's goal is to understand the effect of drought hazards in subsistence agriculture using a novel integrative framework that merges data, models, and knowledge of drought risk and crop production; their interactions with the dynamics of trade-based and aid-based responses; and their effect on household food security and consumption. We are addressing three questions: 1) What are the spatio-temporal scales of drought risk across Zambia and how does risk transfer into agricultural impacts? 2) What is the role of trade and domestic food policy on food security at local to national levels? 3) Can drought impacts be more effectively reduced by integrating an understanding of policy and food transfers into an agricultural drought early warning system?  To answer these questions, we are collecting  biophysical data to characterize historical droughts and their impacts on regional agriculture; examining household and market level data to characterize food security outcomes, market prices, and food sourcing; using complex network analysis to characterize food trade and flows; assessing market integration associated with price fluctuations and infrastructure to determine economic exposure and resilience at the household, community and district levels; examining how policies at the national scale constrain decisions at the local scale; and developing computational models for high resolution predictions and to explore probabilistic solutions for resource allocation and risk management. This project is the first to create an integrated model of food trade, household consumption and crop production at such fine spatial scales built on an empirical foundation in each dimension."

Past studies tell us that trade in the middle ages connected the North Atlantic islands to only one country. However, this scientist's earlier research showed that nearly 1,000 years ago the Vikings traded and sold cloth in London and other European markets. This means that 900 years ago, women in places as far away as the islands of the North Atlantic made cloth for markets in distant places. The reason this is important is because it suggests that women's work was key to developing commodity markets that were the ancestors of today's market. By understanding how early international trade began in the North Atlantic and expanded as far as the Volga river, the research will contribute knowledge about the emergence of today's more complicated trade systems, how trade affects women's labor, and how people make decisions about what to make and what to trade.<br/><br/>Paragraph 2: <br/>This scientific investigation will employ a mixed methodology to document and analyze textile collections from rural and urban, North Atlantic and European contexts.

Strontium isotope analyses and pXRF data of archaeological samples and modern wool will be carried out in order to map isotopic signatures geographically and provide insight into the movements of textiles and the compounds used in their production across long distances, such as to North America, northern Europe and Eurasia.

As such, summarization techniques have great potential to make large video collections substantially more efficient to browse, search, disseminate, and facilitate communication.  Such increased efficiency will play a vital role in many important application areas.  For example, with reliable summarization systems, a primatologist gathering long videos of her animal subjects could quickly browse a week's worth of their activity before deciding where to inspect the data most closely.  A young student searching YouTube to learn about Yellowstone National Park could see at a glance what content exists, much better than today's simple thumbnail images can depict.

Unsupervised methods, which are the cornerstone of nearly all existing approaches, have become increasingly limiting due to their reliance on hand-crafted heuristics.  By instead posing video summarization as a supervised learning problem, this project investigates a markedly different formulation of the task.  The research team is investigating four key new ideas: powerful probabilistic models for learning to select the optimal subset of video frames for summarization, semi-supervised learning models and co-summarization algorithms for leveraging the abundance of multiple related videos, algorithms for exploiting photos on the Web to improve summarization, and evaluation protocols that assess summaries in a way that aligns well with human comprehension.  The broader impact of the proposed research includes practical tools for video summarization, scientific advances that appeal broadly to several communities, publicly disseminated research results, inter-disciplinarily trained graduate students, and outreach activities to engage young students in STEM education and career paths."

HyPO takes a fundamentally different, quantitative approach by answering the question: What arrangement of atoms is most probable given a map? The combination of HyPO and powerful new neutron sources at collaborating Oak Ridge National Laboratory will make neutron crystallography more accessible to structural biologists. HyPO will be used to analyze ferredoxin, a key enzyme in photosynthesis whose hydrogen atoms have never been directly observed.

These various scales of motions can be captured by fine-grained WiFi signals to perform continuous wellbeing monitoring. Wellbeing monitoring leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure is particularly attractive as it requires neither wearing body instrumentation nor active monitorng by the user. Such an approach would facilitate a broad range of healthcare related applications at home environments without frequent hospital visits, such as real-time prediction and prevention of certain health problems (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and sleep apnea). Using existing WiFi infrastructure for wellbeing monitoring not only advances and extends the applications that could be supported by WiFi networks but also enables easy and large-scale deployment in non-clinical settings due to the proliferation of WiFi networks. Additionally, the educational efforts include curriculum development, outreaching to high school students, and engaging both undergraduate and graduate students in research.<br/><br/>This project focuses on building a WiFi enabled continuous wellbeing monitoring framework for fine-grained sleep monitoring and vital signs tracking at home environments. Users do not need to wear any sensors or actively participate in the monitoring process. The proposed framework targets to advance techniques in device-free fine-grained sleep events identification and vital signs tracking during sleep by utilizing existing WiFi signals. The proposed framework develops device-free localization strategies, vital signs tracking methods and statistical learning techniques to depict a comprehensive picture of users' wellbeing. Such wellbeing information is further utilized to assist in real-time disease prediction by leveraging today's ever-growing mobile environments. A hierarchical multivariate logistic regression model is developed to effectively mine through health conditions and identify risk factors of certain diseases. Chances of developing certain health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, is promptly predicted.

It becomes increasingly important to carefully manage such large data center networks to support multiple tenants, meet service level agreements of applications, and reduce operation cost. Most network management tasks, such as traffic accounting, traffic engineering, load balancing, and performance diagnosis, rely on accurate and timely measurement of time-varying traffic across the entire network. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are three key problems in today's measurement support: (1) Network device vendors often treat measurement as a second-class citizen, devoting most of the resources to meet the networking control functions (forwarding, firewalls, load balancing, etc.), leaving limited resources for supporting measurement. (2) Operators have limited control over what (not) to measure and when to measure. As a result, the already limited measurement resources are sometimes wasted to measure flows that operators do not care, leaving even fewer resources for measuring important flows. (3) These solutions are device oriented instead of network wide. Operators have to dive into the limited measurement support at multiple devices, taking great efforts to understand these measurement results offline, and find it challenging to answer their network-wide queries.<br/><br/>This project aims to design and build a programmable measurement architecture MAP, which transforms today's network measurement practice in enterprise and data center networks. Inspired by software-defined networking, MAP allows operators to flexibly program their network-wide measurement queries in a controller. To answer these queries, MAP automatically configures and coordinates new measurement primitives at different places across the network stack. MAP also allows operators to dynamically change their queries and automatically reconfigure the primitives accordingly to handle network dynamics.<br/><br/>There are three key research directions: First, the project will bring novel measurement algorithms and designs throughout the network stack (VMs, hypervisors, switches, and packet sniffers). The researcher will redesign the measurement primitives at these devices to make them both generic in supporting diverse measurement requirements, and efficient in packet processing performance with limited resources and capabilities. Second, the researcher will design new declarative measurement abstractions for operators to clearly express what to measure at the network level and their accuracy/timeliness requirements. The researcher will also design and implement a runtime system that automatically matches the measurement abstractions with primitives at devices, dynamically allocates resources across tasks and handles network dynamics such as mobile hosts and routing changes. Finally, the researcher will study how to support several important and novel measurement tasks with MAP?s primitives, abstractions, and runtime, and evaluate them on MAP. <br/><br/>The proposed research, if successful, will fundamentally change network measurement and management practice in enterprise and data centers, and lead to new designs of network devices. The research will facilitate inter-discipline research between theory, programming languages, and networking. The project also has a significant education component, including the design and innovations of graduate courses and course material on software-defined networking and computer networking, as well as research experiences for undergraduate students and members of under-represented groups."

This project takes an end-to-end view of traffic classification, observing that in addition to the memory usage at switches, other, cheaper resources are involved in packet processing, specifically bandwidth to transfer selected packets to the receivers, and the receiver systems themselves. The proposed approach trades off memory for bandwidth by introducing overselection, in which approximate classification made in reduced memory introduces additional unwanted traffic. The idea is that in many applications, the side-effects of overselection are quite manageable; the project will investigate multiple types of applications such as middleboxes and packet scrubbers that can tolerate overselection. <br/><br/>The approach involves a Cuckoo-filter-based approximate prefix matcher at switches, which stores classification rules with different prefix lengths. The key challenges in supporting distributed approximate packet classification include: (1) new data structures that best support the tradeoffs between memory and overselection; (2) new algorithms and systems that handle traffic dynamics and network dynamics with overselection; (3) systematic analysis of the impact of overselection on different network functions; and (4) spatial and temporal coordination of switches and receivers.  This project will enable innovations and redesign of these management applications relying on traffic classification in software defined networks (SDN), and thus lead to more efficiently managed enterprise and datacenter networks. Moreover, the work will facilitate interactions among theoretical and systems research. Finally, the principal investigators have a record of engaging underrepresented groups and undergraduates in research and plan to continue these engagements as part of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wearable construction toolkits such as Lilypad have shown promise in attracting underrepresented groups to STEM, expanding perceptions of computing, and empowering users to create personally meaningful computational designs.  These tools, however, set a high bar to entry, especially for young children, by requiring some programming, an understanding of electronics and circuits, and manual skills like sewing.   This research will investigate new interfaces, techniques, and tools to enable children ages 5-10 to program, build, and use their own interactive wearables.   While the target age range is ambitious, spanning differences in cognitive and motor skills as well as educational experiences, a key focus of the work is to better understand how to increase the approachability of wearable design, even for young children, and to scaffold users into creating increasingly complex designs to match their ability level.  Project outcomes will inform future digital-physical kits for children, advance our understanding of how to engage children in computational thinking and construction, and contribute to the areas of wearable computing and interaction design for children more broadly.  While the immediate target community of this research is young children, the methods will have broader implications for maker tools in general.  Working with his partners, the PI will conduct ""making"" workshops and run case studies which will provide new opportunities for engagement in design and STEM.  These case studies will also allow children to showcase their designs publicly.  The PI will open source his artifacts, create and upload generally accessible videos to YouTube, and maintain a public website describing the work.<br/><br/>This research will explore new tools, techniques, and interfaces for overcoming key challenges that currently limit broader participation in wearable creation, particularly with young children, and evaluate new developmentally-appropriate approaches in a mixture of lab and field studies.  The project will introduce a tiered hybrid tangible-graphical approach to wearable design, wherein children build and program their wearable creations physically by using tangible plug-and-play modules.  For older children (ages 8-10), touchscreen interfaces will allow the creation of increasingly sophisticated designs through visual programming, debugging, and sensor-based programming by demonstration.  This empirical research will advance the growing area of programming approaches and creative design tools for young children, and will provide the first assessments of how young children build wearables, including what they want to build, how they approach the building process, how they use their own designs in their everyday lives, and skill development related to engineering and computational thinking."

We have grown accustomed to constant upheaval in computing -- quicker processors, bigger storage and faster networks -- but this century presents the new challenge of almost unlimited access to raw data.  Whether from sensor networks, social computing, or high-throughput cell biology, we face a deluge of data about our world.  Scientists, engineers, policymakers, and industrialists need to use these enormous floods of data to make better decisions.  This research project is about providing foundations for tools to achieve these goals. Simple models give only coarse understanding.  The world is sophisticated and dynamic, providing rich information.  Furthermore, representation of uncertainty is critical to discovering patterns in complex data.  Not only are many natural processes intrinsically random, but our knowledge is always limited.  The calculus of probability allows us to represent this uncertainty and design algorithms to act effectively in an unpredictable world. The gold standard for probabilistic analysis is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a way to identify hypotheses about the unobserved structure of the world that are consistent with observed data.  It is a powerful and principled way to perform data analysis, but traditional MCMC methods do not map well onto modern computing environments.  MCMC is a sequential procedure that cannot generally take advantage of the parallelism offered by multi-core desktops and laptops, cloud computing, and graphical processing units.  This research will develop new methods for MCMC that are provably correct, but that take advantage of large-scale parallel computing. There are a variety of broader impacts of this work.  In addition to the core technical contributions, the project engages in deep scientific collaborations.  New photovoltaic materials will lead to better solar cells and more sustainable energy production.  New techniques for uncovering genetic regulatory mechanisms will lead to better understanding of disease. Quantitative models of mouse activity will give insight into the neural basis of behavior and provide a deeper understanding of brain disorders.  <br/><br/>From a technical point of view, this work pursues two complementary approaches to large-scale Bayesian data analysis with MCMC: 1) a novel general-purpose framework for sharing of information between parallel Markov chains for faster mixing, and 2) a new computational concept for speculative parallelization of individual Markov chains. These theoretical and practical explorations, combined with the release of associated open source software, will yield more robust and scalable probabilistic modeling. It will develop provably-correct foundations and efficient new algorithms for parallelization of Markov transition operators for posterior simulation.  These operators will be used in three collaborations that are representative of the methodological demands for large-scale statistical inference: 1) predicting the efficiencies of novel organic photovoltaic materials, 2) discovering new genetic regulatory mechanisms, and 3) quantitative neuroscientific models for mouse behavior. While this proposal focuses on the generalizable technical challenges of these problems, these collaborations provide compelling examples of how machine learning can be broadly transformative.<br/><br/>Finally, the project includes a significant outreach component, engaging with local middle schoolers, and involving underrepresented minorities in summer research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program will be run at Lehman College of the City University of New York, a designated Minority Serving and Hispanic Serving Institution located in the Bronx, New York.  Students will be drawn from the greater New York metropolitan area, which has a population of 18.9 million and has over a million college students.  At least half of the student participants will be recruited from academic institutions where research opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are limited, including two-year colleges.  Large numbers of students enter college planning to study science but exit with degrees in other fields.  Many factors have been cited for the attrition, including the larger workloads for science majors and the pull of grade inflation of the non-sciences.  Involvement in scientific research early in the undergraduate experience has been suggested as a way to increase retention, especially for groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.  We aim to reach students early in their college career -- at a critical transition point where many choose non-scientific majors -- and provide a supportive environment to make progress on challenging, open research problems.  While traditionally REU programs have focused on upper division students the summer before their final year of college, our program will recruit ten students at earlier stages in their college career and run during the academic year.  The goals of this program are to involve students early in a dynamic research program, show how research can be integrated into their lives, and encourage the students to pursue future research opportunities.  The program is designed to complement the academic schedules of the local community and four-year colleges with all-day on-site meetings on Fridays during the fall semester and an intensive program during the January intersession.   <br/><br/>The intellectual focus of this undergraduate research program is on a simple, but extremely powerful, model: a ""tree"" or acyclic graph.  Mathematical tree structures are ubiquitous in biology and computer science, used in such diverse fields as evolutionary biology to computer science.  The simplicity of the structure yields many open problems at the intersection of biology, computing, and mathematics that are approachable by strong students.  The program is structured to build students' competence and independence in research and problem solving activities.  The cohort of students will consist mostly of second year students: many will have little experience of working on open research projects, collaborating with others, and communicating scientific ideas.  As such, the program assumes no past experience (other than success in early STEM courses that emphasize problem solving skills) and builds a framework that moves students towards independence.  The program structure offers a mix of instruction in technical skills (such as the use of LaTeX, technical writing, and poster design) and academic topics (that will provide additional tools for tackling the open research challenges) as well as a framework to encourage the development of interpersonal skills (such as the responsible conduct of research, collegial interactions, and successful collaborative skills).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research involves rare-earth based materials due to their excellent fluorescence rare earths have already found a significant application niche in lighting, solar cells, sensors, biological and medical diagnostics and imaging. The bioimaging applications will be further advanced in this project. It is a continuation of the previous study in which rare-earths were combined with a unique nanocarbon material, so called single-wall nanotubes. Nanotubes by themselves has been already used in various miniaturized sensors, which are so extremely small that can be placed on a fabric thread. Most recently this group proposed using nanotubes enclosed in the DNA for studying live cells and has obtained promising results. It has been already demonstrated how nanomaterials could improve sensing capabilities of rare-earths. New project will extend this study and focus on nanotubes as tiny antennas to magnify the optical signals received by rare-earths. Due to small (nanometer) scale of these optical elements they can penetrate inside the cells and transmit the biologically relevant information from there, potentially improving our knowledge about how cells work as building blocks of organisms and helping medicine and health sciences in solving their current problems. This research is accompanied by a vigorous outreach program, aimed both on the local community and STEM students nationwide.<br/>Technical:<br/>This project focuses on developing and studying materials for bioimaging based on the rare-earth complexes with single-wall nanotubes and single strand DNA. Significance of this research is in developing a new biosensing material. Since single-wall nanotubes have diameters of only a few nanometers, they are comparable to many biological macromolecules such as enzymes, antibodies, DNA plasmids, etc. and may interact with intracellular environment. This makes them increasingly relevant for new opportunities in biomedical research and applications. Though at early stage, this project enlighten us about how the living organisms, at the cell level, may be influenced by new modern nanomaterials (nanotubes) upon ingestion. Using optical non-destructing characterization the fate of the nanotubes inside the cells has been already determined on the previous stage of the project. In the course of new project the team will work on intertwined theoretical and experimental tasks, including experimental optical characterization and theory of near-field electromagnetic modes in the hybrid materials of nanotubes-DNA-rare-earth-ions; exploring performance of these nanomaterials for bio-sensing applications in photonic-crystals and inside bio-mimetic hydrogels; studying the role of hotspots in nanotube materials and their influence on the photoluminescence of rare-earth ions and/or DNA; experimental studies of modulation of optical response of photonic crystals  incorporating biosensing materials inside its lattice; application of these nanomaterials inside micro-fluidics sensing system and to studying in vitro neural stem cell. A series of samples will be studied, prepared at Lehigh University as well as at University of Utah, LANL and NIST via the collaboration links. A diverse program for dissemination of those results involves research advising and teaching at Lehigh, outreach at local schools (Palisades High School, Moravian Academy), participation in exhibition at a school children development National facility (the DaVinci Discovery Center), STEM enhancement programs via local Community Colleges (NCCC, LCTI and LCCC) and local Kutztown University, REU and GAAN programs within the Physics Department.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, quantitative estimates of contaminant fate in complex environmental systems cannot be accurately obtained through experimentation and modeling with simple model systems.  For this reason, this project will investigate complex model systems containing binary oxide mixtures to resemble soil-water environments: iron (Fe) or manganese (Mn) oxides as the redox active oxides and aluminum, silicon or other iron oxides as the second oxides.  The main objective is to determine how the presence of a second metal oxide affects the redox activity of Fe/Mn oxides.  Specifically, two model systems will be examined for their redox reactivity with respect to eight organic contaminants: an oxidizing environment containing either manganese dioxide or goethite as the dominant oxidant and a reducing environment containing soluble ferrous ions in the presence of goethite as the dominant reductant.  Experimental and modeling work will be carried out to study the reaction kinetics of the target contaminants in the above systems.  Potential particle interactions will be evaluated based on surface complexation, surface precipitation, heteroaggregation, and competitive adsorption.  This study is the first to examine how the interactions between two different types of metal oxides affect the redox activity of iron and manganese oxides.  This research will generate knowledge that is critical for predicting the fate of emerging contaminants in redox active soil-water environments.  The intellectual merit of this project is based on: 1) a fundamental understanding of the nature of interactions within binary oxide mixtures and how these interactions are affected by solution chemistry including pH, oxide composition, and ionic strength; 2) a mechanistic understanding of how a second metal oxide affects the redox behavior of Fe/Mn oxides under oxic and anoxic conditions; and 3) quantitative modeling of the relative contribution of each type of interaction between metal oxides to the overall inhibitory effect of a second metal oxide on the redox activity of Fe/Mn oxides.<br/><br/>This study will create a new body of knowledge available to aquatic chemists, environmental engineers, geochemists and microbiologists working with metal oxides in terms of either the activity of soil-water environments or contaminant removal.  By developing complex model systems, results of this project can enable a more accurate risk analysis which could eventually be used by public health and environmental agencies for contaminant regulation and environmental clean-up.  This project will also contribute to training, mentoring and overall development of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.  Other planned outreach activities include participation of underrepresented minority and female students (particularly from the Society of Women Engineers), one-week summer workshops for female high school students, broad dissemination to over 30 industrial partners at the annual industrial advisory board meetings for the NSF Water and Environmental Technology (WET) Center, integration into the environmental curriculum at the Temple University, and presentation at Temple seminars that serve 1000+ Temple members and 3000+ working professionals from the great Philadelphia area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental model in plasma physics is the Vlasov-Maxwell system, which is a nonlinear kinetic transport model describing the dynamics of charged particles due to the self-consistent electromagnetic forces. As predictive simulation tools in studying the complex kinetic system, efficient, reliable and accurate transport schemes are of fundamental significance. The main numerical challenges in such studies lie in the high dimensionality, nonlinear coupling, and inherent multi-scale nature in both space and time. Another application concerned in this project is in atmospheric science. One example is the chemistry-climate model in the study of evolution of stratospheric ozone and many other chemical constituents. The present generation of global climate models include hundreds of tracer species in order to adequately represent complex physical and chemical processes, resulting in huge computational cost in computer simulations. <br/> <br/>The PI will develop and analyze a class of efficient, reliable and highly accurate numerical methods for transport problems in plasma physics and atmospheric science.

By a careful design in the scheme formulation, the proposed scheme is free of splitting error and able to conserve total mass of the system. Motivated by the work of PI on developing a fast asymptotic preserving Maxwell solver that is capable of recovering the magneto-static limit, the temporal scale separation issue associated with the Vlasov-Maxwell simulations will be addressed.

This project is extending an existing research Java virtual machine (Jikes<br/>RVM) with support for many ways of doing the things that the new languages need in order to run well<br/>on many-core computers. The primary goal is to devise extensions to standard Java virtual machines for<br/>this new world, and to make it possible for many others to experiment with different ways of implementing<br/>these extensions, thus leveraging the creativity of the whole community of language and virtual machine<br/>researchers. Secondary goals include offering reasonably good initial implementations of virtual machine<br/>extensions as a starting point for future research and development, and proposing specific extensions to the<br/>Java virtual machine specification standard."

Two-dimensional layered materials exhibit some of the most striking physical phenomena in modern materials research and hold promise for a wide range of future devices and technological applications from flexible electronics to energy harvesting and storage to bio-engineering. This project explores emergent electronic and excitonic surface states on layered two-dimensional crystals that arise due to the concerted many-body interactions at nanometer length scales. These investigations will advance our fundamental understanding of surface states that govern the electronic and optical properties of the next-generation nano-optoelectronic devices and the feasibility of two-dimensional nanolasers. These research activities are part of an integrated education plan to further high school, undergraduate and graduate students' nanoscience and nano-optics learning in the greater Atlanta area.

The goals of this research are: (i) understand the fundamental properties of surface states in two-dimensional systems, metallic and conducting surfaces states and topologically protected surface states; (ii) understand the properties of excitons (charged and neutral) at island edges and defects and elucidate the coupling mechanism between excitonic two-dimensional materials and surface plasmons, in particular the mechanism of stimulated emission in excitonic van der Waals heterostructures made by vertically stacking atomic thin materials; and (iii) expand the scope and utility of optical, infrared and terahertz scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy approaches in the field of low-dimensional physics. The results of the proposed research will forward our underlying understanding of surface states that control the electronic and optical properties of two-dimensional emergent material systems and will lead to exotic many-body physics and applications in spintronics, practical quantum computers and solid-state quantum photonics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigation of such limits is traditionally conducted analytically, requiring in many cases substantial ingenuity. As modern information systems become more and more complex, such an approach becomes rather unwieldy. The main goal of this project is to build upon initial successes in applying a computational approach to characterize the fundamental limits of certain distributed storage systems, and to further understand what it takes for the proposed computational approach to be successful in the broad setting of big-data infrastructure.<br/><br/>The proposed computational approach is built upon the vantage point that the overall process of identifying and proving fundamental limits can be alternatively viewed as an optimization problem under the specific constraints of the system at hand and the general constraints of information measures. The difficulty lies in the fact that such optimization programs are usually very large for any practically relevant problems, and numerical results are difficult to interpret. This project pursues three major thrusts: 1) finding more efficient problem representations using symmetry and other constraints; 2) improving the optimization algorithms using domain knowledge; and 3) finding intelligent interpretations of the computed results through duality to facilitate engineering design. The results are expected to have measurable impacts on the following two disciplines: 1) Big-data infrastructure: The ongoing big-data movement calls for information systems with diverse reliability and functionality requirements. By identifying the fundamental limits of such systems, accurate performance evaluations and meaningful design guidelines may be assessed; and 2) Information theory: The proposed study will bridge the disciplines of computational optimization and information theory, and instill more computerized intelligence into information theory research."

Providing well-written objected oriented modern software, using a standardized interface will allow for broader participation of the community in this research area and for educating the next generation.<br/><br/>TECHICAL SUMMARY <br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award. It supports development of new computational methods combining robust electronic structure methods with an advanced many-body theory and machine learning algorithms. The main objective of this project is to develop and implement new methods for the search and discovery of advanced quantum materials with novel magnetic, superconducting and transport characteristics that rely on topologically protected states. The search includes materials that are Weyl-Dirac semimetals and topological superconductors. <br/>The research nurtures the close interaction between theory and computation. The computational approach is based on density functional theory, which is able to predict some properties of many materials including metals and semiconductors, combined with dynamical mean field theory, which includes some effects of strong correlation. To tackle the variety of interactions needed to discover various topological phases in real materials new theoretical methods, powerful algorithms, and computer programs will be developed. Linear response theory will be utilized in order to predict full wave vector and frequency dependent interactions controlling topological superconductivity phenomena. Floquet theory will be used to study topological phases induced by time-dependent fields. The resulting software will contribute to the tools used to search, predict, and discover new materials with topologically protected states of electrons.<br/>The new TOP STUDIO software will be created with a user-friendly interface designed to allow materials exploration by non-experts, by materials scientists and engineers and by theoretical solid-state physicists. TOP STUDIO will promote teaching, training and learning with an educational mode, which can be used to teach students about topological states of quantum matter to students using visualization techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Surprisingly, many problems in low dimensions are usually more difficult than their analogues in higher dimensions and require the use of invariants that go beyond traditional algebraic topology. The PI's particular area of expertise is in Heegaard Floer homology, a collection of invariants for 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, which has been one of the most fruitful areas of research in low-dimensional topology since the early 2000s. These tools bring together several different fields of mathematics, including representation theory, differential geometry, and analysis, and the PI hopes to elucidate the connections between these different areas and expand the discourse among researchers in these fields.<br/><br/>The specific goals of the project are (1) to make progress on a variety of concrete problems in 4-manifold topology, including knot concordance, exotic smooth structures, and embeddings of non-orientable surfaces; (2) to understand the relationship between the Heegaard Floer homology of a 3-manifold and topological properties such as the existence of incompressible surfaces, taut foliations, and left-orderings on the fundamental group; (3) to establish relationships between the knot invariants arising from gauge theory and symplectic geometry and those coming from representation theory and quantum algebra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

That broad bandwidth is critical for maximizing system sensitivity.  The resulting VLBI network will achieve, at 1.3 mm wavelength, tens of microarcseconds of angular resolution on the sky.

Communication among cells is critical for most, if not all, living systems and regulates processes including cell migration, cell division, growth, and death. One way this occurs is though a process called endocytosis whereby molecules are transported into the cell. Endocytosis requires an intricate coordination of proteins inside the cell as well as physical changes to the surface of the cell. The deformation of the cell's surface is central to endocytosis, yet there are few tools that can dissect these physical changes that are necessary for endocytosis. One reason this is difficult to study is that this processes is dynamic and occurs on the nanoscale, beyond the resolution of traditional microscopy. This project will advance the study of nanometer scale cell surface dynamics by developing and applying new methods to measure and manipulate the process of endocytosis in living cells. Many biological processes occur on this scale, and the methods developed in this research will be widely applicable across a range of biological systems including virus entry and budding, cell migration, and neurobiology.  In addition to contributing to understanding cellular processes, the effort will include training students from K-12 through graduate school on microscopy and the value of multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding cellular processes. <br/>The goal of this research is to understand the dynamics of endocytic vesicle assembly and the interconnected roles played by the proteins involved, as well as the physical changes to plasma membrane shape. A recently developed fluorescence microscopy technique is uniquely suited to imaging nanometer dynamics of vesicle formation in real-time in living cells. In Aim 1 the novel microscopy technique is used to measure endocytic pit formation dynamics upon stimulation with EGF. This experimental platform will then be used to dissect the protein dynamics during pit formation, mapping the correlation between protein dynamics and plasma membrane morphology (Aim 2). Finally, a strategy will be developed to physically stall endocytosis utilizing a tethered ligand. This platform will be used to explore curvature sensing and curvature inducing proteins (Aim 3). This research will yield a quantitative description of ligand internalization dynamics and the interplay between protein recruitment and membrane morphology on a millisecond time scale. Completion of this research will shed light on previously undiscovered mechanisms of plasma membrane dynamics and signaling that may revolutionize the way cellular communication is understood. Further, it will provide new tools to broadly improve the understanding of plasma membrane dynamics in cell signaling and homeostasis.  In addition to providing K-12 though graduate students with a rich educational experience, the PI will make available to the community any software that is produced and which is useful to others in achieving high resolution data.<br/>This award is supported jointly by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics"

They have to date been underutilized in solving critical problems in the US educational system, particularly in understanding Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and increasing retention for students traditionally underserved in STEM. The goals of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources through the Critical Techniques and Technologies for Advancing Foundations and Applications of Big Data Science & Engineering (BIGDATA) program are to advance fundamental research aimed at understanding and solving these critical problems, and to catalyze the use of data science in Education Research. As more open-ended learning environments are being employed in schools, it is critical to understand how they affect learning, motivation and engagement in STEM. The most widely used methods in educational research are inadequate for addressing these questions because they do not address the scale and complexity of the data provided from these environments. The current standard practice in learning science and education research for analyzing these types of data is to record student activity in these spaces on audio or video, create qualitative coding schemes, and code the data by hand. This is labor intensive and prone to personal judgment and error. It also tends to result in research that is not replicable or scalable. For example, if each researcher studying important educational areas like collaboration or developing planning skills uses his or her own coding framework in their work, it makes it difficult to group the results of these studies and understand the bigger picture. In addition, it is often impossible for one research group to reproduce the results another research group found by trying to use the other group's coding framework. This Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will advance the understanding of how promising new technology environments affect these outcomes by bringing together experts in computer science, data science and education research to develop new methods of studying these environments that are not likely to have the same problems. By using data from new methods of data capture such as logs of interaction with the objects in a maker space or new data mining techniques to analyze data from audio or video recordings, the Principal Investigators seek to greatly increase the field's ability to learn about what people are learning in these environments.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators propose to bring together experts in data analysis, computer science, and educational research to develop new ways to pursue multimodal learning analytics (MLA). MLA opens the door to exploring learning environments, whether classrooms or design studios, that have been difficult to investigate before. New types of sensors and data mining techniques make it possible to capture the process data that is usually lost in the activities in these spaces. The PIs propose to achieve this through a series of workshops. The first will define directions and map potential tools to important constructs they can be used to measure. The middle workshops constitute a series of iterative cycles of tool development and refinement. The final hack-a-thon workshop will involve participants coding prototypes and full models of tools that will be openly available to the community."

Not only is the theory of geometric flows a fundamental subject in mathematics, but it also has potential applications to other scientific fields including computer sciences, material sciences and physics. One of the most important problems in the study of geometric flows is to understand all possible singularities of the flows, which are in turn modeled by self-similar solutions of the flows. The proposed research on the moduli space of such self-similar solutions is expected to broaden and advance the knowledge and techniques both within and outside of mathematics, such as the topology of manifolds, image processing, crystal growths and the large-scale structure of the universe. In the meanwhile, new ideas and tools will be developed in various mathematical disciplines ranging from differential geometry to analysis. In addition, the PI will continue mentoring and organizing seminars and workshops for undergraduates, graduate students and young researchers. The PI will also actively participate in the promotion of women in mathematics to enhance diversity and gender equity in the society.<br/><br/>The main objective of this proposed project is to establish various geometric and analytic properties of the space of self-similar solutions of geometric flows. First, the PI, in the continuing collaboration with Brett Kotschwar at the Arizona State University, will apply the Carleman type technique to attack the rigidity problem for noncompact gradient Ricci solitons. Second, appealing to the tools inspired in part by the theory of minimal surfaces, the PI aims to describe a much detailed picture of two-dimensional smooth noncompact self-shrinkers of finite genus of mean curvature flow. To achieve this, the PI will begin with investigating the asymptotic structures at infinity of such self-shrinkers which are conjectured to be regular cones or cylinders. Then the PI intends to address the Cylinder Rigidity Conjecture of Ilmanen concerning the uniqueness of self-shrinking cylinders. At the end, the PI, with Joel Spruck at the Johns Hopkins University, plans to seek the sufficient and necessary conditions of the existence of the asymptotic Dirichlet problem for the self-shrinker equation. Third, in higher dimensions, the PI, joint with Neshan Wickramasekera at the University of Cambridge, will extend the regularity theory of stable minimal submanifolds to derive estimates on the size of singular sets of entropy stable weak self-shrinkers."
