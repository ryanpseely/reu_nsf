The project advances flexible probabilistic models capable of accurately representing such data. These models will be leveraged to design scalable analysis and compression algorithms, establish their fundamental limits, and provide provable performance guarantees. In particular, the project will study data-compression algorithms for removing redundancy in large-scale data-storage systems, where traditional compression methods are computationally infeasible. It will also develop novel estimation and testing algorithms for genomic sequences, where existing probabilistic models are too restrictive to faithfully represent their internal statistical structure. The project considers fundamental problems in information theory and statistical signal processing and has the potential to contribute to public health through more accurate statistical analysis of genomic data. The research results will be incorporated in a range of educational activities, including developing interactive and accessible online courses that will emphasize connections between mathematics, engineering, and science, and promote a principled model-based approach to solving engineering and scientific problems.<br/> <br/>The project has two research thrusts, which correspond to two critical settings in which conventional probabilistic models of sequences, most commonly Markov as well as independent and identically distributed (iid) models, and their associated methods, are inapplicable. The first thrust focuses on sequences with long-range redundancy, i.e., with long repeated blocks appearing at large distances, common in terabyte-scale data storage systems. The project will develop generative data-driven models for sources with approximate repeats, establish information-theoretic bounds on compressing them, and develop and optimize compression algorithms, including compression of distributed sources and universal compression for sources with unknown parameters. The second thrust focuses on evolutionary sources, i.e., those that produce data through consecutive edits, used to model the generation process of genomic data. Problems such as parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and the prediction of future behavior for evolutionary sources will be addressed by formulating a stochastic approximation framework in which asymptotic and finite-time behavior of sequences are analyzed. The resulting analysis methods and algorithms developed in this thrust will be used to study several problems in bioinformatics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This simple question is surprisingly difficult to answer because few data exist to document parasite burdens in the past. To circumvent this problem, parasite ecologists have developed and validated a new technique: they can now extract information on parasite burden from liquid-preserved specimens held in natural history collections. This innovation opens a massive opportunity to understand how the infectious disease landscape has shifted in the past 100 years, because millions of suitable liquid-preserved specimens exist that can provide snapshots of parasite burden at particular times and places. In this project, the researcher will use liquid-preserved fish to reconstruct long-term data on the abundance of parasites in river ecosystems of the US South and Southwest. This project will answer a long-standing question with pressing implications for society?s ability to manage infectious disease in wildlife, while simultaneously opening training opportunities for students to participate in, contribute to, and deeply engage with research on a fascinating group of organisms, the parasites.  <br/><br/>This project will address three fundamental questions in parasite ecology: (Q1) How has the abundance of parasites in river ecosystems changed over the past half century? (Q2) What roles have industrial pollution and urbanization played in shaping change in parasite abundance through time? (Q3) How do industrial pollution and urbanization affect the stability (i.e. resistance and resilience) of parasite communities as they experience other disturbances (e.g., drought)? The retrospective control?impact study design (i.e., before?after?control?impact study in which time is continuous rather than discrete) will allow the researcher to test for long-term temporal change in parasite burden and to identify the influence of anthropogenic impacts (e.g., industrial pollution, urbanization) and other disturbances (e.g., drought) on that long-term change. The researcher will incorporate these data into a newly redesigned course in Parasite Ecology that will be shared as an open educational resource and integrate eight undergraduate researchers into her research team, providing many opportunities for students to participate in hands-on research. This project will also result in the development of an open-access learning module that introduces concepts of parasite ecology to elementary-aged learners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has been understood for more than seventy years, but details of the deep structure of these systems remain unresolved. The problem is that most of these mountain chains lie under miles of water in the middle of the oceans (?mid-ocean ridges?; MORs).  Seismological measurements are the main tool for peering tens of kilometres into the planet. This project involves a multi-year placement of ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs) across and along two of these MORs, at a ?triple-junction? location where three of these ridges meet. Seismic signals recorded by these instruments will be used to build 3-dimensional models of the solid Earth deep beneath the MORs. This project includes outreach and training activities. The project will involve high school students and will educate the public by producing films during the expeditions. It will provide research and education opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students through scientific expeditions and classwork. The program will involve early career investigators and generate an open-source manual for planning scientific expeditions at sea. The data will enhance understanding of geohazards and imaging of the entire planet.<br/><br/>The ~50,000-km-long global mid-ocean ridge (MOR) system, the factory where 65% of the tectonic plates are generated, is arguably the defining feature of our planet?s surface.  Yet, fundamental aspects of oceanic extension remain poorly understood, including the mechanisms driving upwelling at mid-ocean ridges and the origin of fabrics and discontinuities in mature ocean plates. This project involves a multi-year broadband ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) deployment across the Galápagos triple junction, involving two diachronous, overlapping ~40 station arrays spanning >400km along strike and perpendicular to the Pacific-Cocos and Cocos-Nazca spreading centers. Surface and body wave tomographic imaging of these MORs, including measurements of seismic attenuation, scattered phases, and seismic anisotropy will provide unprecedented spatial and methodological coverage of lithospheric and asthenospheric structure. This work will: 1) Test predicted signatures of dynamic upwelling; 2) Image MOR melt, dehydration, and shear structures that may persist in mature lithosphere; 3) Explore the 3-D organization of mantle flow beneath the ridges; 4) Exploit contrasts in spreading rate and ridge migration over underlying mantle to gauge the importance of these parameters on ridge dynamics; 5) Investigate MOR maturation beneath a propagating spreading center. Broader impacts target each stage of the pipeline into research: Outreach will educate and engage the broader public and enhance recruitment of high schoolers into the geoscience major. Training will provide research and education opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students through cruises and classwork. Building a Network of Leaders will establish a skilled cohort of early career investigators, and generate an open-source manual for planning OBS deployments. This experiment will also contribute to the international PacificArray initiative, and provide new data for global and deep mantle tomography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Example systems include nursing robots in hospitals, self-driving vehicles, and worker bots collaborating with humans. An explicit ethical awareness in these systems is recognized as a necessary condition for successful daily interaction with humans. However, to this day, there are comparatively few algorithms, and even fewer tools, for designing ethics-equipped Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS), especially when integrated with a physical control loop. This research develops a computational theory and formal design tools for ethics-equipped embodied AIS.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the design tasks of model-checking, controller synthesis, and constrained learning from data, of formalized ethical guidelines. Such guidelines take the form of statements of Obligation (`The robot ought to care for the patient in greater pain'), Permission (`The robot is permitted to offer a mask to a contagious patient') and Prohibition (`The robot is forbidden from factoring gender into care decisions'). The investigators formalize such Obligations, Permissions and Prohibitions in a deontic logic developed as part of the project. Methods from software engineering, optimal control, and deep learning, are employed to create a design pipeline that allows transparent and rigorous experimentation with different guidelines.

Decarbonizing, or reducing carbon dioxide emissions from, the electric power sector underpins climate change mitigation. In the near-term, regardless of decarbonization progress, climate change will intensify. As climate change intensifies, it will increasingly affect our weather, including through more extreme events. Extreme events will pose new challenges to avoiding power system outages, or to maintaining system reliability. Maintaining reliability is essential to promote human and economic health and wellbeing. This project seeks to better understand three questions: (1) How can power systems decarbonize while delivering reliable and affordable electricity under a changing climate? (2) How will climate change impact system reliability of alternative future power systems? (3) What strategies exist that further decarbonization, affordability, and reliability of power systems under a changing climate? The project?s scope spans the conterminous United States. To promote national health, prosperity, and wellbeing, this project will translate its scientific advances for power system stakeholders through a series of workshops and other training venues. This project will also provide graduate students new educational opportunities through stakeholder-driven problems. The PI will recruit underrepresented minorities and female undergraduate and graduate students to contribute to research on this project. <br/><br/>Given the scale of real-world power systems coupled with deep climate uncertainty, existing power system planning methods are ill-suited to answer our research questions. Robust decision-making (RDM) offers a new approach that has promising capabilities to bridge the above domains and their uncertainties, enabling discovery of decarbonized, cost-effective, and reliable systems that are robust to climate change. This project?s overarching goal is to develop a transformative framework that applies RDM to next-generation planning, operational, and reliability models to achieve decarbonized, cost-effective, and reliable systems under climate change. This goal will be achieved for each of the three main US regional Interconnects (i.e., conterminous US). The above research agenda will be tightly integrated with an educational plan for STEM students and power system stakeholders. Education will be guided by an advisory board of diverse power system stakeholders. Innovative educational programming for STEM undergraduate and graduate students will combine theory from mini-courses with practice from stakeholder-driven experimental projects focused on real-world problems. Stakeholder programming will leverage workshops, the Institute for Public Utilities, and other venues to educate stakeholders on risks of and adaptation strategies to climate change. The project will seek to support qualified under-represented minority and female STEM scholars, at both the graduate and formulative undergraduate stages, increasing diverse representation in an important STEM field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deciphering the dynamics of disease is essential to earlier and more effective interventions to mitigate disease spread. To fully understand these dynamics, information across systems that operate on multiple spatial and time scales, as well as evolving via feedback, must be combined. This research project aims to develop a mathematical framework to combine and analyze such information to further the understanding of infectious disease spread, providing insight for ongoing and future disease outbreaks. The results are also intended to be applicable to multi-scale questions in ecology and immunology more generally. The educational component will serve to train a diverse generation of interdisciplinary scientists, building the capacity of the STEM workforce. Through focused short courses aimed at providing specific, relevant skills in quantitative techniques and cross-disciplinary communication, graduate students in the mathematical and life sciences will learn to collaborate and communicate effectively. Training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students will take place through focused research projects and opportunities to garner translational skills, for example developing and implementing project-based work and participating in outreach activities. Additionally, interactive presentations will engage middle school students through exposure to cutting-edge mathematical biology research.<br/> <br/>The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of interpretable, quantitative models that link mechanisms with data while accounting for variability. However, infectious disease dynamics remain incompletely understood, in part due to the lack of heterogeneity considered in models of immunological, ecological, and epidemiological aspects. Complex, non-linear feedbacks arise from heterogeneities; thus, novel quantitative frameworks are needed to better understand and control infectious disease. This project builds on work in ecology involving integral projection models to develop a framework incorporating trait-based variation. This framework aims to describe development of immunity in a population and, thus, determine disease risk over time. Results will be useful for monitoring infectious disease, selecting interventions, and informing public policy. The educational component aims to strengthen quantitative literacy to help produce a more interdisciplinary workforce. A group of graduate students, across applied, mathematical, and computational disciplines, will be introduced to fundamental quantitative skills such as statistical analyses, model building, parameter estimation, data visualization, and coding.

The project includes an educational component that involves researchers at many career stages through (a) the supervision of postdoctoral researchers and Ph.D. students; (b) the organization of a quarterly weekend conference to train students in scientific communication; (c) the organization of a winter workshop aimed at graduate and advanced undergraduate students, with week-long short courses by experts on research topics related to this project; and (d) the writing of a book based on advanced topics courses given by the PI, with significant input from the students who attended these courses.<br/><br/>At a technical level, the main goals of the project are to (1) construct new examples of nonlinear entire solutions to variants of the minimal surface equation, and prove related Bernstein-type theorems; (2) investigate singular structures that appear in solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic equations such as the Monge-Ampere and quadratic Hessian equations, motivated by applications to complex geometry, optimal transport, and meteorology; and (3) construct new examples of singular minimizers of classical variational integrals in low dimensions, and discover structure conditions that prevent the formation of singularities. The equations under investigation share features (degenerate ellipticity and the existence of singular solutions) that limit the usefulness of standard techniques. To address these challenges, the PI will pursue new approaches that unite several areas of mathematics, and build sophisticated technical tools to carry out these approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, this project is funded by the Division of Environmental Biology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>All multicellular organisms pass through different stages in their life cycle. These stages may differ in the number of cells, the number of chromosomes per cell, or the arrangement of genetic information on the chromosomes.  For example, humans have two life stages: the haploid stage consists of eggs or sperm, and the diploid stage extends from embryo to adult.  These alternating stages make a life cycle.  Across the natural world, there is an amazing diversity in the duration and complexity of life cycles.  This project will expand our understanding of this diversity by linking predictions about life cycles and reproductive variation.  Understanding the convergence of these two fundamental organismal traits ? the life cycle and reproduction ? is crucial for predicting how species are likely to respond to environmental challenges.  Common garden experiments and DNA analysis of a widespread seaweed will allow the investigators to explore these connections. The research plan is enhanced by a month-long field course for undergraduates, in which students learn about algae in marine and freshwater ecosystems.  Students in this course also collect data for the two main research aims. In addition, research is coordinated with the Alabama Water Watch and the Cahaba River Society.  Coordination with these groups increases scientific and environmental literacy in Birmingham and across Alabama.<br/><br/>The researchers leverage a widespread seaweed that has become invasive where it has been introduced in the Northern Hemisphere.  Upon invasion, the diploid stage predominates.  The project investigates how the life cycle of this alga has responded to the process of invasion, thus permitting a test of the connections between life cycles and reproduction.  Two sets of experiments address two major questions.  The first set of experiments distinguish between predictions of ecological and genetic models.  Here, researchers carry out common garden experiments to reveal how different genotypes respond to environmental conditions important to an intertidal alga, such as salinity and temperature. According to ecological predictions, the two life stages should respond differently.  The second set of experiments evaluates how the relative length of the diploid and haploid stages affect the reproductive system. To investigate this question, DNA is sampled from natural populations of the seaweed?s native and introduced range.  Population genetic analysis determines whether a prolonged haploid stage affects seaweed reproduction.  Specifically, it can detect whether the seaweeds mate by outcrossing, self-fertilization or asexual propagation, and whether this reproductive strategy varies depending on the different type of life cycle.  Together, the results of these experiments provide unique insight into the ways in which life cycles and reproductive strategies are interdependent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike conventional histopathological spatial image analysis methods that classify image regions into two or more categories, the proposed method overlays the results of the classification from heterogeneous cancer-associated populations to proactively determine the spatial correlations of different cancer-associated populations cells in both the high level of infiltrating immune cells and the low level of infiltrating immune cells.

It quantifies the state of randomness or uncertainty of a physical system and has numerous applications in machine learning, data compression, and quantum mechanics. In this project entropy is studied in two settings. In the first the entropy of a dynamical system is considered. Dynamical systems describe the state of a certain physical system (e.g., amount of a certain gas inside a room, spread of viruses) as it changes in time. It is useful and natural to make ?time? abstract and replace it with a discrete system of symmetries called ?groups.? Dynamical entropy was originally defined through an information theory viewpoint, and recent developments show that this perspective allows one to expand entropy theory to evolution under a certain class of groups called ?sofic groups.? In this new framework, entropy describes how many finitary approximations an infinitary system has; a fundamental question of scientific inquiry. The second setting for entropy is in the context of von Neumann algebras (specifically in free probability), which arise naturally as the setting for quantum mechanics and provide a precise framework for quantum computing. Potential applications in cryptography are vast. Investigating entropy in this setting amounts to understanding the disorder of a quantum mechanical system. These problems have links to functional analysis, ergodic theory, operator algebras, random matrices, and geometry, some of which will be explicitly addressed. The educational component is directly aimed at broadening participation in mathematics and the sciences. This includes starting a teaching and diversity seminar at the University of Virginia to create a more diverse inclusive environment in the department and running a summer school to bring researchers in different fields together. An expansion is planned for the role of the bridge program at the University of Virginia, as well as the department's involvement with the math alliance. These two endeavors are explicitly aimed at increasing the representation of underrepresented groups in mathematics.<br/> <br/> <br/>This proposal revolves around two main projects. The first is the study of entropy in algebraic actions, which are actions of a discrete group on a compact group by automorphisms. One goal is to completely settle the connections between f-invariant entropy for algebraic actions of free groups and a generalized torsion theory (in the sense of topology) for noncompact Riemannian manifolds defined via Hilbert spaces. Planned is an extension of our current understanding of which algebraic actions are isomorphic to Bernoulli shifts. In von Neumann algebras, the principal investigator will expand on his recent joint work showing that Property (T) von Neumann algebras have few finite-dimensional approximations. These concepts will be generalized to groups with vanishing first cohomology with values in the left regular representation, as well as to inner amenable groups. Expansion of these results is planned to twisted group von Neumann algebras, and compact quantum groups, provided such objects have vanishing first cohomology in natural analogues of the left regular representation. Lastly, the term mean dimension will be adapted from the ergodic theory setting to the von Neumann algebraic setting with the ultimate goal of settling the famous generator problem for von Neumann algebras in the negative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the fossil record has helped us better understand past extinctions and ecological changes, which are increasingly relevant to a rapidly changing planet. At the same time, the fossil record is highly incomplete, and it can be difficult to unify our understanding of ecosystems across long periods of time spanning millions of years. This project seeks to synthesize information from data-rich fossil and modern communities in a unique island system to reveal broadly applicable patterns and processes that are responsible for maintaining biodiversity. This research focuses on ants and ant communities of Hispaniola, which are both preserved in high detail in the amber fossil record and highly diverse on the island today. This synthesis will address key questions including: Why do some organisms go extinct while others persist over long periods of time? How predictable are changes in ecosystems and communities across long periods of time? How quickly do these changes occur? Knowledge and data resulting from this research will be used in the creation of K-12 educational materials, which will be developed through interdisciplinary collaborations between industrial design and biology undergraduates. Educational products will be widely disseminated in schools and museums in the U.S. and Dominican Republic. The project will produce biological, ecological, and analytical resources for researchers locally and worldwide.

However, the existing statistical theory remains highly inadequate in explaining many new phenomena that emerge, and become pervasive in modern machine learning applications. For instance, the prevalence of over-parameterized models (i.e., the ones that have more model parameters than samples) challenges our classical statistical insights about the bias-variance tradeoff; the fact that many learning algorithms exhibit favorable algorithmic regularization to alleviate overfitting is largely beyond the reach of previous statistical literature, and the unconventional shapes of the risk curves in modern applications puzzle many statisticians. Compared to the rich theory developed for classical settings, however, the statistical underpinnings for these curious yet mysterious phenomena remain far from sufficient. Motivated by this, the overarching goal of the project is to enrich the statistical foundation of machine learning by adapting it to contemporary settings, thereby bridging classical statistics and cutting-edge machine learning. In addition, the project will provide valuable opportunities for training students (particularly underrepresented groups) at all levels across multiple disciplines in the STEM field, and will exert scientific and societal impacts on several domains beyond the tasks described herein, including but not limited to neuroscience, online education, and equitable machine learning.<br/><br/>Striving for interpretability and actionable insights, this project plans to revisit multiple classical statistical problems---ranging from minimum-norm interpolation, risk estimation, cross validation, kernel boosting, data-imbalanced classification, to transfer learning---with an emphasis on unveiling new insights for modern yet under-explored regimes. Several recurring themes include: (i) characterizing precise risk behavior in the face of large model complexity; (ii) reconciling the seemingly conflicting goals of over-parameterization and regularization; (iii) developing algorithm-specific statistical reasoning tools; and (iv) exploring the interplay between regularization and generalization. The project comprises three distinct yet related thrusts: (1) statistical insights for over-parameterization: which explores the prolific interplay between model complexity and out-of-sample performance; (2) algorithmic regularization via early stopping: which aims to develop statistical principles that underlie early stopping; (3) risk (non)-monotonicity with imbalanced data: which is motivated by the non-monotonicity of generalization errors in the sample size and pursues principled debiasing methods to rectify it. The project will develop a suite of statistical insights that can inform cutting-edge machine learning practice, as well as an array of statistical methodologies that will be practically appealing for modern data-driven applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stem cells also have the potential to influence immune response and wound healing. However, their promise has not yet been realized in the clinic. Recent work has explored how biomaterials can control hMSC behavior. However, how hMSCs change biomaterials over time is unknown. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award will address how biomaterials change over time due to stem cells, how stem cells respond to biomaterials, and the interrelationship between the two. The results of this project may lead to improved stem cell-based therapies for conditions like osteoarthritis.

People with walking problems due to aging or neurological disorders such as stroke and Parkinson's disease often participate in gait training therapy to improve their walking ability. Current gait training methods primarily focus on improving leg movements and overlook the role of arm movement, even though many people do not demonstrate appropriate arm swing. Walking is a complex skill requiring highly coordinated leg and arm movements. Arm swing then is an essential component of walking that impacts stability, balance, and energy efficiency. To improve walking, a whole-body approach should be adopted, one that takes advantage of how all four limbs work together in gait production. This Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will establish a novel framework for employing appropriate arm swing in gait training to create more effective methods with enduring improvements for people with walking difficulties. The objective of this project will be accomplished by quantifying normal arm swing while considering factors such as age and walking speed, and then creating novel approaches using wearable robotic devices to induce normal arm swing during walking. The use of these robotic devices will enhance gait rehabilitation providing a significant impact on society given that the ability to walk is crucial for daily living activities, and many individuals, for a variety of reasons, have difficulty in walking efficiently. The education plan will engage students with disabilities, who are underrepresented in science and engineering. Their involvement in research using assistive robotic devices will encourage them to pursue further education and careers in this field and help with student retention.<br/><br/>The research goal of this proposal is to establish an effective gait training approach by inducing whole-body responses during walking.  This project seeks to fundamentally understand how to exploit interlimb neural coupling and utilize arm swing to enhance gait rehabilitation. Two major approaches for incorporating appropriate arm swing into gait training will be investigated to determine how interlimb coupling can be used to improve key parameters such as coordination, symmetry, variability, and walking speed. In one approach, arm-swing patterns generated in real-time by a novel model using thigh and shank kinematic data will be utilized in wearable robotic devices. These devices will attempt to induce correct arm movement in coordination with leg movements at various walking speeds while gait parameters are recorded. In the second approach, arm swing will be altered by robotic devices to modulate the amplitude and frequency of leg movements to improve gait parameters. Two novel wearable robotic devices will be created as research tools to examine how tactile and kinesthetic force feedback methods can instigate and alter arm swing in users during walking at self-selected speeds. The interlimb coupling in each approach will be quantified by analyzing muscle activity using techniques such as intermuscular coherence analysis. Participants in these studies will include healthy young and older adults, older adults with slow gait speed, and individuals who have suffered a stroke and walk with difficulty but are able to walk without an assistive device. This research project will employ the intrinsic tendency to couple upper and lower extremities in creating a highly effective gait rehabilitation approach that will be significantly beneficial for a wide variety of individuals with gait deficits. The project?s education plan will promote teaching and training assistive robotics among students with disabilities, K-12 students in rural areas, and groups underrepresented in mechanical engineering including female students.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how cells differentiate into various cell types and how cells change during evolutionary process has been a long-standing scientific problem. Recent sequencing and imaging technologies can provide large scale data for each single cell in a tissue, including the amount of mRNA products of a gene, the amount of protein products of certain genes, the chromatin 3D structure, and the spatial location of each cell. The project will develop computational methods to learn mechanisms in cell differentiation and development from complex and high dimensional data. The project will provide open-source tools for the community and can be integrated with educational activities and outreach, such as courses on topics of algorithms in computational biology. Opportunities for high school and undergraduate students especially those from underrepresented groups will be provided to participate in cutting-edge research in computational biology.<br/><br/>During recent years, single cell technologies have progressed in terms of both ?modality? and ?scale?. In terms of modality, multi-omic technologies allow researchers to profile each single cell from multiple aspects, including transcriptome, genome, chromatin accessibility and protein abundance. In terms of scale, more cells, tissues, individuals, and species are profiled with single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology. Computational integration methods have been developed to integrate single cell data from different modalities or different batches. The goal of the project is to develop integration tools with a strong emphasis on mechanisms, and to learn molecular mechanisms from the large-scale, multi-modality single cell data. The specific aims are: (1) develop methods to integrate paired and unpaired single cell multi-omics data from the same tissue, and in particular, propose a method to learn consensus cell identity considering cross-modality relationships; (2) develop deep learning methods to integrate scRNA-seq data from multiple individuals or species. The method aims to remove technical batch effects but preserve biological variation between data matrices and infer the genes which are associated with each meta feature like age and race; (3) develop methods to learn cell-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for cells in a temporal or spatial context. When spatial locations of cells are available, the project will implement a method to learn both cell-specific GRNs and cell-cell interactions. This research has the potential to make a significant step forward in understanding mechanisms in cells and diseases using large-scale, multi-modality single cell data.

This project considers how teachers? engagement in scientific sensemaking as an opportunity for teachers? learning to support more expansive science learning environments. It seeks to address two ongoing challenges in science teacher education: the need for teachers to learn (1) to recognize, value, and integrate students? diverse ways of knowing, communicating, and relating with one another and phenomena and (2) to acknowledge and disrupt restrictive narratives that shape what counts as science in schools and who is seen as a scientist. This project will provide new models for science teacher education to engage teachers in expansive scientific sensemaking, seeking to develop more humanizing relationships between teachers, students, and science. More broadly, the project will produce a new structure for professional learning and resources for supporting more heterogeneous and equitable forms of science in teacher education. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to design and study for secondary science teachers? learning to value heterogeneity and challenge restrictive narratives of science in schools.

In a sense, floodplains are a natural infrastructure that protect human development within a river basin. Unfortunately, rivers and floodplains have been extensively altered around the globe, largely due to engineering efforts to restrain the dynamic nature of river systems, through the construction of levees, dams, and other flood control measures. Unfortunately, these river engineering projects have likely increased the risk of flooding due to loss of natural flood reduction services provided by floodplains. Flood attenuation may be improved, however, by implementing river restoration at large scales, though gaps still remain in understanding of how strategically dispersed restoration, river-floodplain interactions, and characteristics of river networks can enhance the ecosystem service of flood attenuation. This research focuses on building fundamental knowledge of these interactions through a combination of field studies and modeling efforts that examine how human risk to flooding can be reducing while improving floodplain ecosystem services. This project includes an integrated research and education program aimed at mentoring first- generation students, increasing public exposure to river science, and redeveloping and disseminating undergraduate and graduate curriculum to include concepts of sustainable river-floodplain engineering and management.<br/><br/>This research will enhance understanding of how flood attenuation is regulated by both the structure of a river network and the physical characteristics of floodplain environments. The complex cross-scale dependencies of catchment configurations (large scale) and physical floodplain characteristics (small scale) in controlling flood movement through a river basin is still not understood. This research will investigate the importance of catchment-scale restoration, river-floodplain interactions, and the organization of river networks in enhancing the ecosystem service of flood attenuation, which together comprise the foundations of natural flood management. The principal intellectual outcomes of this work will include: 1) a new cross-scale conceptual model describing the relationships between river network structure, floodplain characteristics, and degree of flood attenuation; 2) advanced understanding about the role of catchment-scale river restoration in sustainable water resource management and the strengthening of floodplain ecosystem services; and 3) a novel hydrologic modeling framework that can be used to generate transferrable knowledge about the impacts of river restoration strategies on large-scale floodplain ecosystem services. This research will provide greater insight into how society can harmoniously blend the benefits of river restoration and natural flood attenuation within river catchments. In addition, the model developed potentially may be incorporated into the National Water Model, which is used by the USGS to monitor flooding around the nation. This project will positively impact engineering and river science education by supporting the success of first-generation students at Colorado State University, introducing youth to river science with a placed-based curriculum, and integrating research results into all education and outreach components of this project. The project will support the involvement of multiple first-generation students through the Scott Undergraduate Research Experience program at CSU. Similarly, this project will expand the Girls Advancing Scientific Progress summer program and promote interest in river science through place-based learning. Field data collection and river monitoring activities in this project will be incorporated into two courses that will be redeveloped, enabling students to learn data collection methodologies, modeling approaches, and the importance of supporting catchment-scale river processes in water resources management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some invariants are stable in the sense that they are independent of certain spatial dimension shifts. They are easier to compute because they are in some sense more algebraic. This project has two main themes. The first line of investigation is in chromatic homotopy theory, a field of mathematics that studies structural properties of stable invariants. This part of the project seeks to answer questions such as: Are there families of stable invariants that share common properties? What kind of symmetries exist for these families? How can these symmetries be used to do explicit computations and learn new things about fundamental geometric objects such as higher dimensional spheres? The second line of investigation is part of a multi-disciplinary collaboration with mathematicians and physicists, which uses stable invariants to study the phase of matter. A quantum system is a collection of interacting particles and, roughly, a phase is a family of quantum systems that may be different microscopically, but share certain macroscopic properties. For certain types of quantum systems, the phase type can be detected by stable invariants. This project aims to construct new stable invariants of phases and to study stable invariants of quantum systems equipped with certain symmetries. The broader goal is to make progress on the classification of phases of matter to better understand the fundamental properties of materials. The project has an integrated educational component, one goal of which is to make the two areas of research accessible to graduate students and advanced undergraduates through a series of graduate workshops. The educational plan also includes undergraduate and graduate research. In particular, the project will conduct research in collaboration with existing initiatives at the University of Colorado, Boulder that work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM. An important goal is to increase the accessibility of research for underrepresented minorities in mathematics.<br/><br/>Stable invariants are studied using generalized cohomology theories or, more specifically, mathematical objects called spectra.  Chromatic homotopy theory aims to classify families of spectra according to different periodic behaviors exhibited by the stable invariants they compute. There is a close relationship between periodic behaviors and the symmetries of the spectrum. This project uses equivariant techniques to better understand this relationship. It has applications to the study of stable homotopy groups of spheres. Specifically, the project explores theoretical and computational properties of equivariant generalizations of Lubin-Tate theories that are built from the Real bordism spectrum, an equivariant generalization of complex bordism. The project develops techniques to compute the equivariant stable invariants arising from these theories. In a different direction, the project examines a conjecture that parametrized gapped invertible phases of matter form a generalized cohomology theory. The project proposes the construction of a ground-state bundle for parametrized quantum systems and explores how equivariant homotopy theory can inform the study of systems with symmetries. The project aims to increase accessibility of these topics to students in two ways. First, the project includes two five days mathematical events that combine a graduate workshop with research talks with a focus on the main areas of research of the project. These are to be part of an ongoing series that will continue beyond the five year duration of the  project. These events will create an interactive and collaborative environment between participants and experts by incorporating active-learning in the program structure. Secondly, the project will engage in academic term and summer undergraduate research opportunities in topology and phases of matter with a goal to increase access to undergraduate research for students from historically excluded groups in mathematics. The project will also support graduate students working on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research project focuses on three dimensional manifolds. A three-manifold is a space that near each point looks like the three-dimensional space we live in. Mathematically, such spaces can be approached from different viewpoints. One of them is topological: considering properties of the space that are preserved by continuous deformations. Another viewpoint is geometric: studying certain rigid structures associated to the space. A three-manifold can also be described by equations and by an algebraic object called a group, which allows tools from algebraic geometry. Yet another point of view is computational: many sophisticated algorithms not only help calculate invariants of three-manifolds, but also raise questions about algorithmic complexity of various mathematical problems. This project includes a study of intrinsic geometric and topological properties of 3-manifolds, as well as the rich interplay between all these approaches. Subprojects stemming from interesting special cases of harder problems are suitable for early-career mathematicians, allowing the educational program to be strongly intertwined with the research goals.

Additionally, to promote gender diversity in mathematics, the PI will organize quarterly ?Women in Topology? lectures at Rutgers, Newark.<br/><br/>Within the overarching theme to study intrinsic geometric and topological properties of three-manifolds with finite (hyperbolic or simplicial) volume, the project's goals encompass long-standing open questions about submanifolds of three-manifolds. They include obtaining universal upper bounds on the number of embedded surfaces, in the spirit of Mirzakani?s work on curves, but one dimension up; work inspired by open conjectures about embedded surfaces and arcs by Menasco and Reid from 1992, Sakuma and Weeks from 1995, Finkelstein and Moriah from 2000. Among other questions of interest are problems on the interface of algebraic geometry and knot theory, and conjectures about lower bounds on complexity of well-known topological problems. The outcomes will significantly contribute to low-dimensional topology and geometry, positively impact computational topology, and deepen the connections between geometry, topology, algebraic geometry and theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Buildings constructed in regions vulnerable to seismic hazards in the United States are designed to remain safe during large earthquakes, but structural components, such as diagonal braces, are designed to sustain damage as they dissipate seismic energy. This building damage may be severe and widespread in earthquake-affected communities, inhibiting the speed or possibility of post-earthquake occupancy, functionality, and repair. Steel braced frames are prevalent in existing building infrastructure across a broad range of uses, including hospitals, schools, offices, and industrial facilities, which are critical for post-earthquake shelter and care of people, distribution of goods, and economic productivity. The segmented bracing scheme will mitigate the impact of seismic damage in these common systems and enhance seismic resiliency by enabling relatively fast, low-cost replacement of the brace midspan segment such that most other system components can be safely retained. Experimental testing will investigate the seismic behavior of segmented braces applied to new construction and repair scenarios. An accompanying computational study will expand these findings to evaluate additional design parameters toward the development of design procedures and modeling recommendations suitable for engineering practice. The research activities will be incorporated into a laboratory experience course module in structural steel design and engage underrepresented groups in engineering through undergraduate research opportunities and outreach programs.  This award will contribute to the National Science Foundation role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).  Project data will be archived and made publicly available in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>Concentrically braced frames used in regions with high seismic hazard are expected to sustain large inelastic deformations through brace buckling in compression and yielding in tension. These actions concentrate damage to the midspan of the brace and gusset plate connections, and fracture typically precipitates at the brace midspan. The longitudinally segmented brace scheme, therefore, focuses on repair of the brace midspan while retaining other regions of the brace, the connections, and the framing members. The major research objectives include: (1) development of segmented brace interface connections that facilitate replacement and improve seismic performance through the introduction of additional controlled yielding mechanisms outside the brace hinge; (2) evaluation of seismic behavior of components retained in repair, including residual capacity and performance-based engineering considerations; and (3) generation of practical modeling approaches, performance acceptance criteria, design guides, and other engineering tools contextualized in existing steel building design and evaluation provisions. Large-scale subassemblage testing of frames with segmented braces will be conducted to investigate the new segmented brace design and the effect of damage accumulation in other frame components. The inelastic response of a broader range of segmented brace connection configurations and seismic load histories will be studied using experimentally validated continuum finite-element analysis to inform design and modeling guidelines for segmented braces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include geoscience, medicine, climate science, manufacturing, national security, and economics. Inversion is an indispensable tool to infer knowledge from data in a consistent and predictable way, enabling scientific discovery, decision-making, and ultimately dependable model- and data-informed predictions. However, the practical use of inversion remains limited unless uncertainties can be quantified as they propagate through models and algorithms, Uncertainty quantification adds significant mathematical complications and massive computational costs to an already challenging problem. This project will develop a generic mathematical framework for large-scale, statistical inverse problems alongside software infrastructure with algorithms that scale on modern and future computing architectures. It blends mathematical methods and theory with data-intensive applications and good algorithmic practices to advance the frontiers of computational and data-enabled sciences, with the ultimate aspiration to promote data-driven scientific discovery and model-based prediction and by that, science in general. Alongside research activities, an educational and dissemination program is developed to communicate the results under this work to STEM students and researchers, and a broad audience of computational scientists and application specialists. The project will train students in areas that have seen exceptionally high industry demand in the US in recent years, such as optimization, statistical inference, data-enabled science, performance evaluation, and workload characterization. Educational activities include hands-on research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students, explicitly encouraging participation by minorities and underrepresented groups. Public domain software modules will be made available to a broad STEM audience and practitioners. Applications of this work include medicine, imaging, and geosciences.<br/><br/>Fundamental mathematical and computational aspects of optimization under uncertainty, statistical inference, and the solution of large-scale inverse problems will be investigated in this project to promote the progress of scientific discovery and data exploration. The overarching aim is the design of fast computational kernels and scalable, black-box algorithms that rigorously follow mathematical and physical principles, have a sound theoretical basis, and provably converge to an optimal solution independent of the problem dimension. This includes the development of adaptive, hierarchical numerical schemes and mixed-precision algorithms, enabling high-accuracy computations if desired, and low-accuracy approximations when possible, targeting high data-throughput applications. The project explores (i) foundational mathematical aspects and the deployment of fast (scalable) algorithms for transport-based variational inference, (ii) the design of problem-informed regularization schemes for nonlinear inverse problems, and (iii) the integration of randomized algorithms and learning for the construction of low-order surrogate models for optimization, inference, sampling, and preconditioning. Effective numerical techniques and computational kernels for a fast evaluation of gradient and curvature information and their approximation are of paramount importance for the designed methodology.  The performance will be assessed for parabolic (diffusion-dominated) and hyperbolic (advection-dominated) dynamical systems of varying complexity with applications in computational medicine, climate science, and geoscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thinking tools will include crosscutting concepts such as systems and system models, patterns, and cause and effect, as well as cultural concepts, such as reciprocity, human-nature relations, and responsibility. Instructional design elements that the project will investigate include students? use of thinking tools, model scaffolds, classroom discussions, and the use of cultural knowledge. Fifth-grade science instruction that increases all students' access to science thinking tools is responsive to the mandate for equitable science instruction for all students, including Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. The curriculum materials created in this project will be co-designed by teachers and researchers to develop students? abilities to direct their own scientific thinking. The goals of the project are (1) to develop and refine design guidelines and (2) to develop instructional methods, tools, and strategies for increasing students' abilities to use scientific thinking tools. The project aims to broaden participation in STEM by creating elementary science curriculum that is more effective and equitable, which can increase participation in STEM careers, while also building capacity of participating elementary science teachers.<br/><br/>The study will focus on three research questions: (1) What funds of knowledge do fifth-grade students have for epistemic thinking?; (2) What instructional methods, tools, and strategies can facilitate productive metacognitive experiences that support students' emerging epistemic thinking?; and (3) What supports do teachers need to facilitate productive metacognitive experiences in fifth-grade classrooms? The study will use co-design as professional development within a design-based research framework. The project will engage with (a) 3 urban and rural elementary schools, (b) 7 fifth-grade science teachers, and (c) 340 students over the course of 2 school years and will include teachers and students from culturally diverse backgrounds. Data gathering strategies will include video of classroom interactions and discussions of these events by the project co-design team.

Namely, the project investigates anonymous decentralized payments (blockchain based), anonymous authentication (via the use of anonymous credentials), and auditable multi-party computation (MPC) for specific functions. The performed research includes collaborations with Policy and Economics researchers in order to design meaningful accountability mechanisms and leverage blockchain incentives.

Quantum materials have properties and exhibit phenomena deeply rooted in the laws of quantum physics, thus providing a key resource for future quantum-based technologies. This project specifically focuses on a particularly prominent example of such materials, the topological materials. The remarkably robust electronic properties of topological materials can be understood with the help of abstract mathematical concepts derived from the study of geometry and shape. When the electrons in these materials are strongly interacting, surprising and exotic phenomena can occur. Understanding these phenomena and the fundamental principles that govern them is a key step towards new energy and computing technologies. The goal of this project is to advance a new paradigm for describing and understanding such strongly interacting materials, and thereby to provide a new perspective for materials discovery.<br/><br/>The research activities will build on recent work of the PI, which introduced a formalism for describing systems of interacting electrons that fall outside the currently predominant paradigm for understanding strong interactions. This formalism opens the door to new insight into fundamental properties and behavior of matter, in particular the properties of exotic quantum states, and serves to identify materials in which these are realized. This project will systematically develop and extend the proposed formalism, focusing on systems and materials in two and three dimensions with different structure, chemistry, and symmetry properties. Conceptual advances will be leveraged to provide new pathways to materials prediction and discovery, with the aim of enabling experimental progress on the frontier of correlated topological quantum states.<br/><br/>Quantum materials appear to be at the epicenter of next-generation technological innovation, while at the same time offering unique insight into the fundamental building blocks of matter. This award also supports activities in the areas of education and outreach designed to increase the visibility of quantum materials research and to broaden participation in condensed matter physics. These activities contribute to the workforce in quantum materials and technologies. Supported initiatives include: (i) building a professional development certificate program in quantum technology open to non-physicists, (ii), launching an in-house quantum materials summer school as incubator for collaboration (iii), offering diverse and inclusive pre-graduate research opportunities and (iv) expanding the reach and visibility of condensed matter physics through an outreach program for undergraduates.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education in the rapidly developing field of quantum materials, with a specific focus on strongly correlated topological quantum materials. Topological materials are a new class of quantum materials which have exposed a deep connection between abstract mathematical concepts, for example the topology of wave functions, and physical material properties, for example the presence of intrinsically robust transport channels. Our understanding of topological materials relies on one of the central pillars of the modern band theory of solids: the notion of a band inversion. Given its remarkable success in advancing our knowledge of metals and insulators, the goal of this project is to develop a generalization of the band inversion paradigm to strongly interacting topological quantum states. This many-body band inversion paradigm offers a wave function-based approach to studying the structure, properties, and function of strongly correlated topological quantum phases in quantum materials. It overcomes limitations inherent in the flat-band paradigm inspired by the quantum Hall effect and offers a new materials perspective for identifying materials which may realize exotic correlated quantum states.<br/><br/>The research activities are organized in three interrelated and complementary research thrusts. The first thrust will focus on systems in two dimensions. Computational methods will be employed to map out the phase diagram in model systems for real materials near a correlated band inversion transition. In addition, existing experimental work on correlated topological semimetals will be examined. The second thrust is concerned with systems in three dimension, in particular band-inverted topological semimetals with higher angular momentum and presents a pathway to generalizing the many-body band inversion to three dimensions. The third thrust is informed by the insight of the first two thrusts and suggests a materials platform for realizing strongly correlated topological ground states at a band inversion transition. These thrusts advance the common goal of uncovering new correlated topological phases outside of the current paradigm.<br/><br/>This award also supports activities in the areas of education and outreach. These activities are tightly integrated with the proposed research and harness the ascendance of quantum materials as a key resource for future technology. Supported initiatives include: (i) building a professional development certificate program in quantum technology open to non-physicists, (ii), launching an in-house quantum materials summer school as incubator for collaboration (iii), offering diverse and inclusive pre-graduate research opportunities and (iv) expanding the reach and visibility of condensed matter physics through an outreach program for undergraduates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, tree rings are a promising archive of historic mercury pollution, however there remains a lot unknown about how trees take up and then store mercury in their rings. This research project aims to address this by studying how tree physiology influences how trees capture mercury from the air. Other archives of mercury (e.g. ice cores) often have high uncertainty in their dating and record mercury deposition. Comparing tree rings and other records will improve understanding of historic mercury pollution. There are very few records of mercury in the environment that are older than a few hundred years. One of the aims of this project is to develop records of up to 2000 years of atmospheric mercury, improving our understanding of natural atmospheric mercury, including how mercury is influenced by volcanic activity, wildfire and past climate changes. The knowledge and data generated in this project will be of immense value to future research projects on mercury pollution related to historic industrial practices and land-use changes, and will assist in our research into the nature and scale of industrial era mercury pollution and provide new insights to those seeking to further reduce atmospheric mercury. New reliable records of pre-industrial atmospheric mercury are also extremely important for current efforts to monitor and assess changes in mercury emissions as part of the United Nations Minamata Convention. Information, insights and approaches developed in this project will be used in exciting education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underserved groups, and in hands-on science modules for K-12 educators. <br/><br/>Although tree-rings are a promising high-resolution archive for reconstructing past concentrations of atmospheric mercury (Hg) there remain factors that need to be further investigated. This research project aims to improve the utility of tree-rings as an Hg archive by 1) using concurrent stable carbon isotope measurements to better understand how within-tree processes related to stomatal conductance influence the incorporation of Hg into tree rings; 2) comparing concentrations of Hg in tree rings to measurements from small-catchment lake sediment and ice cores to test the fidelity of the Hg signals observed; and 3) develop long-term records of Hg concentrations derived from tree rings to investigate important natural drivers of atmospheric Hg (e.g. volcanic activity, wildfire & climate). Through the unique combination of Hg concentrations and stable carbon isotope measurements, the biotic influences on the incorporation of Hg into tree rings will be better understood. By comparing concentrations of Hg in tree rings to Hg deposition measurements from small-catchment lake sediment and ice cores, the differences and similarities between these two types of records will improve understanding of how Hg is preserved in these different archives, providing important information on post-depositional processes in depositional archives. Finally, a long-term (up to 2000 year) record of Hg concentration from tree rings will improve our understanding of natural variability in atmospheric Hg.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Geobiology and Low-Temperature Geochemistry Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, given the lack of theory, practitioners often simply follow trial-and-error procedures, leading to heuristics. Characterizing when heuristics turn out to be provable algorithms is one pressing need for the scientific community, and indeed society as a whole. The goal of the proposal is to build algorithmic foundations, along with theory, that accelerate problem solving in such scenarios. This constitutes the design of fast algorithms as an active research area in machine learning, information processing, and optimization research. Understanding how remarkable performance is obtained using efficient algorithms is of ultimate significance towards practical and safely applicable learning. The difficulty/risk of this research lies exactly in the non-convex nature of the tasks, where existing knowledge does not lead to a deeper understanding.<br/><br/>The aim is to provide methodologies that perform faster and better in practical settings, as well as introduce theory that justifies their performance. Given the difficulty and diversity of the task, the PI will focus on three research areas: i) faster convergence in structure-rich problems, with a special focus on matrix-factorized machine learning problems; ii) algorithmic acceleration in more general non-convex scenarios, with a special focus on (shallow) neural network architectures; and iii) acceleration techniques in modern ML systems, such as pruning techniques, distributed protocols and hyperparameter tuning. The objectives mentioned above complement each other: their combination results in a unified mathematical framework that will provide insights on why and how several non-convex tools work in ML and optimization research. The PI will study and analyze algorithms with applications in text analytics, image classification, and practical hard combinatorial problems, among others. The proposed research will analyze ideas beyond classical momentum in non-convex scenarios, such as algorithmic implicit regularization, hyper-parameter tuning, deep matrix factorization, proximal point algorithms and robustness, and lottery-ticket hypotheses, just to name a few.

Initially, such algorithms led to breakthroughs in our digital lives, from automated language translation to improved online search. Increasingly, they impact every aspect of life, from medical image analysis to fraud detection. Machine learning has also risen to paramount importance in the sciences, as researchers use the same algorithms to analyze datasets, test hypotheses, and make predictions, accelerating the pace of scientific discovery. However, despite its success, many foundational questions of machine learning remain poorly understood: What is behind the surprising success of neural networks and when might they fail? How can algorithms be tailored to individual scientific experiments, to leverage centuries of domain specific knowledge as they extend the reach of an analysis? To answer these questions, the investigator will study the mathematical foundations of machine learning, using tools from optimal transport and partial differential equations. This research will be integrated with educational opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. The investigator will hold undergraduate research symposia to improve awareness of campus research opportunities, with the goal of increasing the number of students conducting research projects in applied mathematics. The investigator will also develop a new graduate course on optimal transport and machine learning, the lectures from which will be made publicly available, and organize an early-career researcher workshop geared to graduate students in the western United States, which will provide students in applied mathematics with an opportunity to learn from a cadre of well-established researchers, as well as to present their own work.<br/><br/>At the heart of this research program are three main projects. In the first project, the investigator will study the role of nonlocal interactions in the training dynamics of two-layer neural networks, analyzing how the interplay between model selection, data distribution, and regularity affects robustness and rate of convergence to optimum. In the second project, the investigator will develop particle methods for sampling and control theory based on nonlinear diffusions. In the third project, the investigator will use new optimal transport metrics to develop interpretable machine learning methods for analyzing data from multiple components of a scientific experiment. These methods will then be applied to machine learning tasks in particle physics, including classification of events at the Large Hadron Collider.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER project will advance the understanding of how ROS and RNS levels impact the function of cells and tissues using nano-scale sensors to quantify ROS/RNS concentrations. Ultimately, understanding how ROS/RNS levels correlate with diseased cells and using novel sensors to subsequently quantify these concentrations could provide quick detection of infected individuals, thus leading to improved diagnostics and health outcomes. Integrated with this research are educational efforts that aim to teach rural middle school students, undergraduate and graduate students, and adults over 50 at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) about nanotechnology and sensors. University students will receive training, mentorship, and hands-on experience while directly contributing to the research objectives and will enhance their science communication skills by assisting with the outreach programs, creating a reciprocal relationship between the education and research objectives. Participants in the middle school and OLLI programs will enhance their understanding of nanotechnology and sensors and be able to share their newly acquired knowledge with others, extending the project?s impact beyond the individuals directly participating in the programs.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term career goal is to develop and use single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) sensors to learn about biological phenomena while preparing the next generation for careers in nanotechnology and sensor development.  Towards this goal, this project focuses on advancing the understanding of ROS and RNS in cell signaling by developing a single walled carbon nanotube sensor system that quantifies hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) simultaneously. Research objectives include to: (1) develop a sterile platform system that can simultaneously quantify H2O2 and NO concentrations; (2) identify the concentration profiles of extracellular H2O2 and NO associated with breast, skin, and lymphocyte cells; and (3) evaluate the importance of H2O2 and NO in cellular proliferation, release of inflammatory markers, and cell migration. It is hypothesized that diseased cells will have significantly higher levels of H2O2 and NO and that proliferation rate, migration, and inflammatory factors can be increased or decreased with the addition (causing an increase) or scavenging (causing a decrease) of reactive species. This program represents a novel and transformative approach for quantifying H2O2 and NO and will illuminate basic facts about cell signaling that were previously unattainable. Furthermore, this research represents a new milestone in the field of carbon nanotubes, which has largely focused on developing new sensors rather than using these unique sensors to understand how biological systems function.

The most common approach to check for software correctness is through software testing. The implicit assumption is that a failing test signals the presence of a bug. However, this fundamental assumption is invalidated by the presence of flaky tests, which are tests that nondeterministically pass or fail when run on the same code. Intuitively, there is a nondeterministic component in the code under test or environment that is expected or even desired (and therefore not a true bug in the software), but a developer may have written a flaky test that does not take this nondeterminism into account, resulting in the test to sometimes pass and sometimes fail. When there are flaky tests in the test suite, a developer can no longer trust their test results. If the test failures no longer guarantee the presence of a true bug, developers may then choose to ignore all test outcomes instead of investigating further. At this point, testing become effectively useless, and developers risk critical bugs slipping into the released software. Flaky tests are a common problem faced by developers in industry and the open-source community.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to mitigate the negative effects of flaky tests. To accomplish this goal, this project will (1) develop techniques to more efficiently detect flaky tests by leveraging code evolution, (2) develop specialized testing environments that can reduce flaky test failures without needing to modify code under test, and (3) enhance software engineering techniques that rely on testing to become flaky-test aware so as to not be misled by unreliable test failures. Beyond traditional flaky tests, this project will also (4) investigate and develop techniques to detect and repair tests that are flaky with respect to nonfunctional properties, such as execution time. Finally, given the parallels between flaky tests and difficulties in computational reproducibility, this project will also (5) develop techniques to increase the reproducibility of computational research results based on insights from the work on flaky tests.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If the displacement is incomplete, some of the gas may be entrained as small bubbles inside the drop. This process has been studied extensively for common systems such as water droplets moving through air that impact various kinds of solid surfaces. This ERI award focuses on how the contact dynamics change when the liquid drop contains polymer additives.  The impact of polymer-laden drops on solid surfaces is relevant to many applications including bioprinting, pesticide formulation, and the deposition of pathogen-laden respiratory droplets on surfaces. The influence of polymer additives on air displacement underneath droplets will be examined using a combination of experiments and theory. A state-of-the-art rheometer and a high-speed optical technique that can track the approach of droplets nanometers from contact will be used to assess the air entrainment in droplets containing commercially-relevant polymers such as polyethylene oxide. Results from the project will provide useful information to engineering practioners who must control air entrainment to ensure product quality in various applications.  Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research, and research results will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses. The project will partner with the Mayborn Musuem on the Baylor campus to enhance existing outreach efforts aimed at communicating science to students of all ages and the general public.<br/><br/>Air entrainment is a common industrial problem in inkjet printing and various coating processes.  Although the fundamental hydrodynamics underlying air entrainment has generated broad interest, the problem remains challenging because it spans orders of magnitude in spatiotemporal dynamics. Efforts to uncover the incipient contact of droplets have focused mainly on droplets composed of Newtonian liquids even though important applications involve polymeric drops.  In order to fill this knowledge gap, this ERI project will analyze nanometer- to millimeter-scale dynamics using experiments and theory to uncover the contact routes for polymer-laden drops.  The research comprises three tasks: (1) investigate the influence of polymer additives on air entrainment phenomena; (2) characterize the energy loss caused by the entrained air film during droplet spreading; and (3) analyze strategies to control the air entrainment mechanism.  The influence of polymer concentration on air entrainment and the roles of shear thinning and elasticity will be investigated using a combination of high-speed total internal reflection microscopy and rheometric measurements. The project will develop new experimental tools for assessing the viscoelasticity of polymer-laden droplets, which will benefit researchers studying interfacial phenomena and multiphase fluid mechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on the fundamental computational problems that emerge from the study of spin systems. Specifically, it aims to advance the theoretical understanding of such problems; this is well-known to improve the performance and reliability of applications that utilize spin systems.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the problems of sampling, learning, and testing, which are among the most frequently encountered computational tasks in the context of spin systems.

As such, the project focuses on the rigorous analysis of the convergence rates of MCMC algorithms. For this, several techniques for analyzing Markov chains will be developed or enhanced, addressing the well-known limitations of the available tools for Markov-chain analysis. The second direction of the project concerns the two closely related inference problems of identity testing and structure learning.

They parametrize different geometries on surfaces, so that a point in the moduli space encodes a shape which a surface can assume. Classically, one considers the evenly curved shapes, with richly different points of views arising from hyperbolic geometry, complex analysis, algebraic geometry, and matrix groups. More recently, singular flat geometries have gained prominence because of their relationship to the classical moduli space as well as their connections to important examples in the theory of dynamical systems (systems that evolve over time). This project will advance the study of moduli spaces in five interrelated research programs tied together by shared techniques and analogies. Progress on these research programs will advance the understanding of the geometry of surfaces and higher dimensional spaces and will unlock applications to dynamical systems. The nature of the topics makes their simultaneous investigation synergistic and allows for their integration into educational activities, including the training and mentoring of graduate students, vertically integrated research with undergraduate students, and the development of a new course for the bridge to PhD program. The research with undergraduates program will include a proactive recruiting strategy designed to improve participation of members of groups historically underrepresented in mathematics. Undergraduate participants will be encouraged to participate in the MathCorp summer outreach program, and the more senior participants will receive training on mentoring.<br/><br/>The five research programs that will be undertaken are as follows.

School districts are resorting to employing stop-gap measures, such as emergency certification of teachers without deep mathematics and science knowledge. Another approach has been to certify teachers who have content knowledge but do not have deep pedagogical knowledge or instruction supporting the cultural competence necessary to serve all students. These approaches address an immediate need for teachers but result in a high turn-over rate. This project will address the problem by preparing students in two-person, math-science teams who will undertake applied scientific research experiences requiring both mathematics and science skills. The project will support prospective teachers? translational thinking and communications skills to draw on research in ways that inspire teaching. The project will be infused with elements vital to teaching in high-need schools by leveraging the educator preparation program UOTeach which emphasizes social justice and culturally supportive pedagogy.<br/><br/>This project at the University of Oregon includes partnerships with the Springfield Public Schools. The project will systematically grow sophomore and junior mathematics and science majors' interest in teaching as a career, resulting in at least 25 certified science or mathematics teachers over five years. The project will also create a professional learning community for rising undergraduate interns, graduate UOTeach Scholars, and practicing teachers. The activities and strategic scholarship support are designed to develop (a) identities as science researchers, mathematicians, and science and/or mathematics teachers, (b) cultural competence, and (c) research-supported instructional strategies that support the vision of the Next Generation Science Standards (NRC, 2013) and the Common Core Math Standards. Due to the project's focus on applied science and mathematics research to inspire teaching, and the deep equity focus of the UOTeach program, practicing teachers will enter high-need school districts with the cultural competence as well as pedagogical and content knowledge to effectively teach in a high-need school district for four or more years. This project builds on prior work that highlights the importance of engaging in knowledge production, communicating that knowledge to others, and realizing that the doing of science requires trial and error as vital components of the teacher preparation process (Baxter, et al., 2014, Baldwin & Darner, 2021). The project will require extant materials to be refined to incorporate mathematics into existing mentorship and instructional support for prospective teachers engaged in research (Baxter & Ruzicka, 2017). Through interviews and surveys, the project team will monitor the efficacy of research inspired teaching and teaming of mathematics and science majors for the development of mathematical understandings and pedagogical strategies that benefit their future students. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

To ease the privacy concerns of data owners, researchers and practitioners have been advocating a new learning paradigm ? federated learning. Under this framework, the central learner trains a model by communicating with distributed users and keeping the training data stored locally at the users. While opening up a world of new opportunities for training machine-learning models without compromising data privacy, federated learning faces significant challenges in maintaining statistical efficiency and security due to the heterogeneity and unreliability of the distributed users. Successful completion of the project provides key enabling technologies for efficient and secure federated learning and accelerates its adoption in security- and safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars and personalized medicine. The proposed education activities include teaching and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students targeted specifically at members of under-represented groups and community outreach aiming at raising public privacy and security awareness. <br/><br/>This research develops an interdisciplinary program to investigate the fundamental and algorithmic aspects of federated learning ranging from statistical efficiency to security and privacy. The statistical efficiency of the widely-adopted algorithms is analyzed beyond their failures of reaching stationary points. New algorithms are developed based on meta-learning and clustering, and shown to be statistically optimal even in the presence of model and data heterogeneity. Moreover, this research conducts a comprehensive study of decentralized learning under Byzantine attacks. By borrowing insights from robust statistics, byzantine-resilient gradient descent algorithms with exponential convergence to the optimal error rates are devised. Finally, to protect the learner's privacy against eavesdropping attacks, the investigator aims to design optimal private learning strategies by innovating ideas from information theory and duality theory between the learner and adversary.

However, for several natural phenomena, the area functional is only a first approximation. In order to capture microstructures, most models in the sciences use directionally dependent functionals, referred to as anisotropic energies. Ever since the introduction of anisotropic energies by Gibbs in the 19th century to model crystals, they have been extensively applied in material sciences and engineering, motivating seminal works in geometric analysis. However, since anisotropic energies are not invariant under translations and rotations, they don?t enjoy the conservation laws of the area functional, which makes them significantly more complicated to study.

Understanding existence, regularity, uniqueness and stability of solutions to anisotropic geometric variational problems plays a major role in analysis, geometry, topology and physics.

Thus, tree rings are a promising archive of historic mercury pollution, however there remains a lot unknown about how trees take up and then store mercury in their rings. This research project aims to address this by studying how tree physiology influences how trees capture mercury from the air. Other archives of mercury (e.g. ice cores) often have high uncertainty in their dating and record mercury deposition. Comparing tree rings and other records will improve understanding of historic mercury pollution. There are very few records of mercury in the environment that are older than a few hundred years. One of the aims of this project is to develop records of up to 2000 years of atmospheric mercury, improving our understanding of natural atmospheric mercury, including how mercury is influenced by volcanic activity, wildfire and past climate changes. The knowledge and data generated in this project will be of immense value to future research projects on mercury pollution related to historic industrial practices and land-use changes, and will assist in our research into the nature and scale of industrial era mercury pollution and provide new insights to those seeking to further reduce atmospheric mercury. New reliable records of pre-industrial atmospheric mercury are also extremely important for current efforts to monitor and assess changes in mercury emissions as part of the United Nations Minamata Convention. Information, insights and approaches developed in this project will be used in exciting education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underserved groups, and in hands-on science modules for K-12 educators. <br/><br/>Although tree-rings are a promising high-resolution archive for reconstructing past concentrations of atmospheric mercury (Hg) there remain factors that need to be further investigated.

Through the unique combination of Hg concentrations and stable carbon isotope measurements, the biotic influences on the incorporation of Hg into tree rings will be better understood. By comparing concentrations of Hg in tree rings to Hg deposition measurements from small-catchment lake sediment and ice cores, the differences and similarities between these two types of records will improve understanding of how Hg is preserved in these different archives, providing important information on post-depositional processes in depositional archives. Finally, a long-term (up to 2000 year) record of Hg concentration from tree rings will improve our understanding of natural variability in atmospheric Hg.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Geobiology and Low-Temperature Geochemistry Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Building turbulent and chemical models that make accurate predictions with known uncertainty are crucial to enable the design of cleaner and better engines as well as the prediction of disastrous fire risks to meet the urgent need for global sustainability. One of the biggest challenges in quantifying the uncertainty for turbulent combustion simulations is the computational cost associated with complex chemistry, where tens of thousands of parameters are involved. Thus, it is currently impossible to estimate the uncertainty for each parameter and to predict the effects on turbulent combustion simulations. This project aims to establish a theoretical foundation and develop a computational framework to address these challenges. The development of the open-source packages in the project will engage a broad community and provide educational opportunities to undergraduate students in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>The current project aims at addressing two technical questions: first, how to quantify the kinetic uncertainty in turbulent combustion simulations to evaluate the soundness and guide the development of turbulent combustion models; and second, how to leverage experiments not only to validate but also inform the development of chemical models. The proposed work will validate the hypothesis of universal kinetic sensitivity direction in laminar and turbulent flames to build the theoretical foundation for reducing the dimensionality of the uncertain kinetic parameter space via the active subspace method. Furthermore, a computational framework and open-source packages will be developed, combining physics-informed active subspace estimation, auto-differentiable programming, and GPU acceleration, to enable the forward and inverse uncertainty quantification in large-scale combustion simulations with affordable computational cost. The framework will be adopted to demonstrate the feasibility to 1) constrain kinetic uncertainties based on canonical combustion measurements, and 2) quantify the effect of kinetic uncertainties on laminar and turbulent flame responses.

The focus of this project is on developing efficient and scalable zero-knowledge proof schemes, an important cryptographic primitive to ensure data privacy and computation integrity simultaneously. <br/><br/>The project advances three aspects of the zero-knowledge proof schemes: theory, application and system level. On the theory side, new practical schemes with linear running time in the size of the computation are constructed based on error-correcting codes and expander graphs. On the application side, the project investigates machine learning algorithms and graph algorithms and develops efficient zero-knowledge proofs tailored for these applications. On the system side, the project initiates the study of memory-efficient and distributed algorithms for zero-knowledge proofs. The project will bring the efficiency and scalability of zero-knowledge proof to the next level, making it applicable and accessible to the broader community of engineers and developers in the industry.

As middle and high school math classes include more statistics, teachers will need support in developing knowledge and resources for teaching statistical concepts and applications. In any learning context, students draw on their own knowledge and experience to understand new topics and concepts. This project will engage students and teachers in finding meaningful ways to use statistical reasoning to make data-based arguments and reason about patterns they observe in society. This CAREER award is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The project examines the development of statistical literacy that combines statistical reasoning and thinking. The focus is in designing and refining an empirical theory of change for supporting the development of teachers? statistical literacy. In this case a critical statistical literacy also includes how students learn about statistics in ways that are grounded in their experience and understanding of the world. Statistical literacy for students and teachers helps interpret and explain social phenomena using data collection and analysis. Students should be prepared to develop data-based arguments for interpreting and explaining real phenomenon. The project will use professional learning communities for teachers to learn about statistical literacy and develop learning experiences for their students.

They are huge, easy to penetrate, and structured without sufficient isolation. Attackers exploit weak outer shells and instantly gain access to the whole system. For example, malware such as SolarWinds or Stuxnet has penetrated deeply into government and corporate systems to leak, control, or corrupt sensitive information such as nuclear control systems, finances, or state secrets. Breaches like this cost billions of dollars per year across the public and private sectors. LAVA addresses this problem by automatically partitioning systems into limited-access compartments and introduces mechanisms to ensure decomposed software elements cannot corrupt each other while efficiently allowing legitimate interactions and discovering attacker behavior. All prototypes will be released as open source artifacts that can be used by non-expert end users. New findings will be incorporated in Rice University security courses. A mini-series of Arduino based lectures and labs will be released with security challenges and taught through the Rice REMSL program as well as homeschool communities to engage elementary aged children.<br/><br/>Determining required access and capabilities for users of complex systems is challenging. For example, the Linux kernel has over 200 modules and would require over 40000 unique access control decisions. LAVA (Least-Authority Virtual Architecture) suggests the radical view of an end-to-end compiler and runtime framework for analyzing, optimizing, transforming, and enforcing compartmentalized systems. There are three primary challenges and objectives. First, how to scale to large numbers of objects and users without complete system expertise? LAVA addresses this with a new unified representation and analysis framework that is mapped from source code to target runtime and enforcement mechanisms. Second, how to enhance security with fine-grained compartments without degrading performance? LAVA's novel runtime architecture provides efficient yet secure system isolation using a combination of new mechanisms and portable translation layers to optimize policies. Third, how to monitor attackers that easily cloak themselves inside of black box applications? LAVA extends the enforcement monitor with provenance tracing that is capable of deploying security policies as well as tracking and investigating attacker behavior. The overall outcome is an efficient and powerful in-process monitoring facility that can detect sophisticated cloaked threats in real systems. Programs can go from monitoring a few objects to monitoring the majority. The project will contribute analysis frameworks, compiler extensions, and a security monitor with appropriate abstractions and protection mechanisms to make protection fine-grained and fast.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, prior fuzzy extractors do not secure known biometrics. This project builds a computationally secure fuzzy extractor that secures all possible distributions. Such a universal fuzzy extractor is not possible if one desires information theoretic security.

IoT clouds must manage trust for hundreds of millions of IoT devices and users, and provide device manufacturers reliable and usable tools for secure IoT deployments. In the IoT cloud systems, compromised security or improper deployments can cause hazardous and deadly consequences. The outcomes of the proposed work will (1) establish the foundational scientific theory, security principles, and practices that define the field of IoT cloud security and (2) protect PaaS and IaaS IoT clouds that underlie the wide array of Smart Home, Health, Industrial, Smart City, Retail, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. Techniques and tools to be developed in this project will be used by IoT developers, security analysts in industry, academic researchers, and a wide range of students (system security, formal methods, and engineering).<br/><br/>IoT cloud systems have specific challenges imposed by their requirements of large-scale distributed trust management and secure support of emerging IoT computing paradigms such as IoT interoperability, which preclude direct application of solutions devised for general-purpose systems.

The first thrust is to formalize the threats concerning the emerging paradigms of IoT interoperability to conduct novel attacks, and formally verify their security in IoT cloud systems and protocols. The second thrust is to explore and understand emerging cyberattacks leveraging misconfiguration of cloud IoT policies by device manufacturers, and develop innovative formal modeling and verification approaches to elevate security assurance of policy specification and cloud-based IoT deployments. The third thrust is informed by the first two thrusts, which identify the threats and challenges, and is to fundamentally address the threats by developing a systematized IoT-cloud security framework with a set of innovative techniques, including secure clean-slate design of IoT interoperability protocols, a novel in-device channel control framework, and hardened supply chain for IoT brokers (a core component of IoT clouds).

With or without people?s awareness, from personal computers to smart phones, from critical infrastructure to cyber-physical systems, software is powering tens of billions of devices and systems. These systems are commonly attacked by an adversarial type of software, malware, which is developed and deployed by cyber criminals. Unfortunately, the inaccessibility of source code of software severely hampers the effort of making software and systems more secure from two aspects: (a) Not having access to source code of common software makes it harder for software auditors to discover and mitigate software defects and backdoors; (b) Not having access to source code of malware makes it harder for security analysts to understand and defeat cyber threats in a timely manner. Despite years of research, modern tools and techniques in the field are insufficient in recovering readable source code from software artifacts. Therefore, developing new technologies and tools to effectively recover source code from software will greatly improve the security of modern software, which will in turn benefit the security of the entire society.   <br/><br/>Decompilation refers to the process of recovering source code from software that is already compiled into machine code. This research project consists of three major research thrusts with the final goal of developing a set of new techniques to support a purpose-specific and source-language-agnostic binary decompiler. First, recognizing different tasks in security analysis may have different end goals (e.g., the readability of a single function versus the understandability of program-level data flows), this project will systematically study common security-specific purposes for decompilation. For each purpose, this project will develop specific decompilation and optimization techniques. Second, this research project will generate new theories and methods to transform monolithic binary decompilation practices into modular, pluggable, and configurable techniques and steps. Finally, the crux of this project will be studying the automated generation of compiler-specific models and techniques for transforming binaries compiled in high-level languages (e.g., Visual Basic 6, C++, Go, and Rust) into high-quality pseudo-source code output that exhibits features in the original high-level programming languages. Besides research publications, this project will produce a fully open-sourced, source-language-agnostic binary decompilation framework, which will facilitate activities in security industry, research, education, and among enthusiasts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical challenge facing society is reconciling the growing demand for infrastructure materials, which cause significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from manufacturing, with meeting goals to mitigate further climate damage. Yet there is a substantial potential environmental benefit of infrastructure materials: their long service lives can facilitate extended storage of GHGs, in particular by sequestering carbon in their structures. Wood is an example of a material of construction that sequesters atmospheric carbon by incorporating it through photosynthesis. Concrete and other infrastructure materials of construction are also able to sequester carbon. There remains a need for a theoretical and empirical foundation from which to build and capitalize on this opportunity. The goal of this research is to formulate new understanding of driving mechanisms to engineer infrastructure materials to sequester GHGs, while minimizing environmental impacts stemming from the production of infrastructure materials. The focus will be on infrastructure woods, concrete, and plastics, culminating in an understanding of the global sequestration potential from these materials. This research will be integrated into the educational goals of broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in engineering and instilling an environmental sustainability perspective for future engineers. <br/><br/>This research will be implemented through a three-part methodology: (1) Deriving methods needed to understand the effects of resource flows and process selection on the environmental impacts from infrastructure materials. (2) Integrating material performance into environmental impact comparisons to understand how new materials can be engineered for GHG sequestration. (3) Elucidating mechanisms to drive GHG sequestration in infrastructure materials. This research will investigate a systematic approach to engineering GHG-sequestering infrastructure materials through coupled probabilistic environmental impact assessment and material performance modeling. Specifically, the research targets: (1) characterizing the environmental impacts associated with unstudied resource flows; (2) understanding the largest drivers in environmental impacts and impact uncertainties from producing infrastructure materials, as well as mechanisms to lower them; (3) formulating models to link material performance to GHG-fluxes associated with material production, longevity, and disposal to determine thresholds at which GHG-sequestration occurs and sequestration potential for new materials; and (4) discovering the most effective strategies to manage material resources to drive GHG-sequestration. This work will elucidate new opportunities for material technologies, with potential to transfer to other classes of materials and to chemicals. The educational goals will be achieved through three tasks: (1) Constructing an interactive museum exhibit showing environmental impacts from anthropogenic material demand to support environmental literacy in K-12 students.

Increasingly, these electronic, data storage, and energy conversion devices must also operate under challenging conditions, including extreme temperatures, high pressures, large electromagnetic fields, and harsh chemical environments. Simultaneously, thermal properties play an outsize role in determining the overall performance of these technologies. For example, poor heat dissipation can limit the reliability of electronics and hard drives, while high-performance thermal insulation materials instead must greatly reduce heat transfer. Non-invasive temperature mapping with nanoscale spatial resolution is thus critical for optimizing the performance and reliability of a wide array of modern technologies. However, most existing thermometry techniques either require physically contacting samples with a temperature probe, which can perturb the sample and preclude measurements in challenging environments, or else lack the spatial resolution needed to resolve nanoscale temperature heterogeneities.<br/>  <br/>The central goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing a novel super-resolution nanothermometry technique, enabling far-field optical temperature mapping with sub-diffraction limited spatial resolution. The proposed technique relies on luminescent nanomaterials called upconverting nanoparticles that can operate under wide-ranging conditions and independent of sample form factor or material type. Using a custom-built imaging and spectroscopy system, the principal investigator and her research team will adapt a Nobel Prize-winning super-resolution imaging technique called stimulated emission depletion for thermometry. The team will demonstrate temperature-dependent stimulated emission depletion spectroscopy, use spatially resolved stimulated emission depletion measurements to map surface temperature profiles of microfabricated heater structures with spatial resolution down to ~60 nm, and apply stimulated emission depletion nanothermometry to uncover failure mechanisms in operating optoelectronic devices, a major challenge that cannot be fully addressed by existing techniques.

This project will also build upon existing collaborations between Rice University and Houston-area community colleges to implement summer research experiences for community college students and to develop outreach events that promote career opportunities in nanotechnology and thermal management. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to test models for interfacial phonon heat transport by mapping temperature with sub-nanometer spatial resolution across strongly bonded interfaces. The nanothermometry measurements will leverage the temperature-dependent thermal diffuse scattering that has been detected in scanning transmission electron microscopy diffraction patterns and annular dark field images. This thermal diffuse scattering is directly related to the local atomic vibration amplitudes, which increase with increasing temperature. Calibrating and mapping the thermal diffuse scattering as a function of beam position will allow experiments with sub-nanometer electron beam diameters to measure the temperature profile with ultrahigh spatial resolution. These thermal electron microscopy experiments will be compared with theoretical predictions by combining atomistic modeling of temperature-dependent atomic vibrations near interfaces with multislice electron diffraction calculations to quantify the thermal diffuse scattering. The results will provide insight into the underlying physical mechanisms of interfacial thermal transport across semiconductor-semiconductor and semiconductor-metal junctions. Future application of this fundamental knowledge could allow engineers to improve the thermal design of interfaces in nanoelectronics and information storage technologies, with the goal of enabling more efficient device performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, it is critical for K-12 education to support all students in developing algebraic knowledge. Covariational reasoning, or the ability to reason about relationships as quantities change together, is one way of thinking that can provide a foundation for students to build their more abstract algebraic knowledge. The research builds a foundation for integrating education and research at the intersection of students? developing algebraic knowledge, covariational reasoning, and new educational technologies to create a new path into algebra. This path can help remove barriers that have historically restricted access to mathematics and STEM coursework and careers. <br/><br/>To develop this new path into algebra, the project extends prior research exploring how middle-school students can reason covariationally to develop understandings for ideas critical to algebra. Two research questions guide the project: (i) How can middle-school students? covariational reasoning serve as a foundation for their development of algebraic reasoning and knowledge? (ii) What general paths support students to develop algebraic reasoning and knowledge via their covariational reasoning? The project addresses these questions by enacting multiple phases of small-group and whole-class design-based research cycles with middle-school students. Each phase will produce new insights into students? learning by characterizing ways individual students build their algebraic knowledge via their covariational reasoning. Comparing and contrasting individual students? progressions will support the articulation of general paths students progress through as they develop their algebraic knowledge via their covariational reasoning. In each phase, the project will iteratively generate and test tasks situated in the free, publicly-available, Desmos platform to create a research-based sequence of Desmos activities, including teacher support materials, that have been effective in supporting students? algebraic and covariational reasoning. These efforts will also allow for the development of principles for designing dynamic digital tasks to support students? covariational reasoning and algebra learning.<br/><br/>This award is funded by in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).

Megalomyrmex consists of 45 ant species with a range of lifestyles, where some are predators and others maintain more beneficial associations with other insects. These mutualist ant species protect their associates from predatory threat using venom weaponry. In contrast, several Megalomyrmex species are social parasites (i.e., one social insect exploiting another social insect) and use their venom to dominate these other species. In this case, Megalomyrmex ants consume young ants and food from their partnering species. Megalomyrmex is exceptional among venomous organisms because of the breadth of interactions mediated by venom. By studying the composition of venom, novel natural products, some of which can be used in agricultural or medicinal practices, could be discovered. This research brings together public engagement and a research-integrated education plan that includes the development of a non-biology majors? undergraduate course?blending research and outreach foci, while creating broad access to scientific thinking. These projects will involve training and mentoring of postdocs, PhD students, and undergraduate student researchers. Trainees will develop projects aligned with proposed aims and present results at scientific meetings and in scientific publications. An undergraduate summer internship program associated with Ohio Ant workshops will be established. <br/><br/>The evolution of venomous species and venom complexity can provide wide-ranging insights into evolutionary ecology because changes in venom composition catalyze both speciation and coevolution. The proposed research leverages current venom evolution theory to explore comparative questions relating to ant venom alkaloids. The challenge is that, despite multiple parallel origins, we are in the early stages of understanding how eco-evolutionary processes relate to venom and lineage diversification. This is in-part because of the necessity for cross-cutting approaches using comparative phylogenetics, functional assays, and behavioral and chemical ecology. Megalomyrmex is an ideal model to address questions about ant lineage diversification and how venom evolves because species engage in various trophic interactions with other organisms. In this project, researchers will: (1) determine venom and lifestyle (i.e., predator, trophic mutualist, parasite) evolution in Megalomyrmex ants using comparative phylogenetics, while uncovering ecological relationships between host and parasite ant species pairs using cophylogenetic inference; (2) clarify how ecological lifestyles predict venom-related traits (e.g., use, venom drop size, toxicity) and contribute to venom evolution, by testing venom complexity hypotheses; (3) delimit cryptic species and revise Megalomyrmex while training taxonomists using a modern integrative taxonomic approach; and (4) broaden engagement in science and nature by demonstrating the ecological relationships of symbioses, while instructing a new general education course, Symbiotic systems: Serendipity or selfishness.

Equally important is the understanding of the use of the energy reach compound ATP in specialized proteins to fuel biological machines and to control key energy conversion processes. A related issue that requires detailed understanding, is the problem of directional motions of biological motors that generate directional force in muscular, cardiac, and neural cells that are often involved in diseases due to faulty functions. Similarly, the understanding of the action of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is crucial for having a clearer view of the way external factors such as different hormones activate cellular process.

The main challenge is to produce proofs of correctness that ensure the composite behavior of IoT devices in physical spaces - the environment in which they operate - adheres to desired safety and security policies. Recent research in systems security introduced methods to synthesize IoT implementations that guarantee a range of safety and security policies. These approaches focus either on policy specification and verification of individual components in isolation of each other or ensure security through models solely abstracted from the source code of programs. Despite the success of past research, there is a significant gap in developing theory and practice that indicates how the behavior of each device can be unified to formally reason about the safety and security of IoT systems in practice. This project integrates research activities aimed at designing and developing algorithms and tools that formally produce the composite behavior of an IoT system and a rigorous foundation for reasoning about an IoT environment's global safety and security. The results of this project will ultimately enhance the current verification and validation practices of IoT systems and build trust in national infrastructure and protect citizens.<br/><br/>The specific goals of the project are divided into three research thrusts. The first thrust focuses on constructing a novel composite model by unifying the behavior of individual system components through a combination of static analysis and system identification techniques to represent an IoT system's global behavior. The second thrust aims to establish a rigorous foundation for identifying physical behavior-based policies and developing formal analysis techniques that ensure an IoT system adheres to safety and security policies. The last thrust seeks to establish a series of techniques to make model construction and policy validation scalable and exhaustive in diverse IoT systems. A common theme in all research directions is the adaptive creation and disposal of system components that allow for flexible configuration of added, removed, and updated IoT devices, programs, and environmental changes. Thus, the research activities will apply to existing software systems and guide future system designs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large swath of modern number theory is concerned with the study of symmetry.  One way in which symmetry arises in number theory is through Galois theory: this is the study of the symmetry of solution sets of polynomial equations over the rational numbers.  Another way in which symmetry arises in number theory is through analysis: there are a class of special functions, called automorphic forms that satisfy a certain set of differential equations and possess an infinite group of discrete symmetries.  The conjectural Langlands Program relates Galois theory to automorphic forms, even though on first appearance the two areas of mathematics have nothing to do with one another.  This project concerns the study of automorphic forms, especially those that exhibit ""exceptional"" groups of symmetries.  The Principal Investigator will investigate the subtle and surprising connections that automorphic forms have to arithmetic.  He will also study L-functions of automorphic forms, which are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function.  The grant includes funding for graduate students, who will receive training in automorphic forms. While supported by this grant, the Principal Investigator will write a graduate textbook on ""exceptional algebraic structures"", which will fill a need in the literature.  He will also help train the US workforce through mentoring of undergraduates and early-career colleagues.<br/><br/>This award has three related research projects.  In one project, already underway, the Principal Investigator will develop the theory of half-integral weight modular forms on exceptional groups.  It is expected that the Fourier coefficients of these half-integral weight modular forms will be highly interesting arithmetic quantities.  The second project involves the production of modular forms on the exceptional group G_2 with rational Fourier coefficients and development of arithmetic consequences of the existence of such modular forms.  This will lead to a partial database of modular forms on G_2.  In a third project, the Principal Investigator will construct new automorphic L-functions.

Past work suggests that storytelling pedagogy can support identity development. However, individual reflection and storytelling are typically not included in a traditional engineering curriculum that is focused on the application of scientific knowledge to solve engineering problems. This project will incorporate the element of storytelling and public performance into the pedagogy of multiple engineering courses. Undergraduate engineering students will learn storytelling techniques and apply these techniques to narratively communicate their personal experiences in engineering education. Using a mixed methods approach, this project will examine the efficacy of storytelling on student success in terms of students? sense of belonging, professional identity, and persistence in the major. This project will identify themes in students? stories that are associated with the most substantial impact on student success outcomes.

These complex and dynamic structures encode important information about underlying biological mechanisms. Innovative approaches are needed to fully exploit these structures and to predict biological and clinical outcomes. By identifying crucial structural patterns, scientists can better explain disease progression and discover novel structure-informed diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers. The challenge is that the structures are often highly complex in geometry and topology, and highly variable. Topology is the branch of abstract mathematics that deals with structures such as connections and loops; this project combines advanced mathematical theory from topology (in particular, persistent homology) and modern deep learning to develop novel methodology for accurate reconstruction and analysis of these complex, dynamic and heterogeneous biomedical structures. The outcome of the project will not only generate novel learning methods that are better suited for these topology-rich structures, but also advance the understanding of the functionality of different biomedical structural systems. This project also trains the next generation of researchers and educators through a carefully integrated educational and outreach plan. By implementing a Play-With-Data (PWD) principle, the investigator will engage students and the public through direct interactions with real-world data. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to create a foundational topology-driven learning paradigm for biomedical structures, including segmentation, generation, and analysis. Using the theory of persistent homology, which provides robust and differentiable representations involving topology, the investigator will (1) explicitly capture and reason in a topological feature space, and (2) seamlessly incorporate topological reasoning into modern learning in an end-to-end fashion, so that critical topological patterns can be learned in a data-driven and task-driven manner. Technical contributions are proposed to address key theoretical and algorithmic challenges in formulating topological information as a topological loss. The loss is used to train image-segmentation models with high topological accuracy, which is crucial for structural analysis. The investigator will also develop topology-aware deep generative models that can learn topology from the real data. Novel topological representation and learning algorithms will be developed to fully exploit the topology-rich structures and identify crucial patterns differentiating populations. The investigator will also investigate new time-varying topology representations and address the challenging problem of learning the dynamics.

Programming such systems is notoriously difficult and error-prone due to messages being reordered or delayed and the possibility of machines and network connections failing.  Widely-used protocols are meant to ensure, for instance, a given message delivery order or a given data consistency policy, but machine-checked proofs ensuring the correctness of executable implementations of these protocols are rare.  The goal of this project is to mechanically verify real, executable implementations of distributed systems, using powerful tools built into a general-purpose programming language.  The project's novelties are in its focus on immediately executable implementations, and in its modular verification approach that separates lower-level message delivery concerns from higher-level application semantics. The project's impacts will be in improving the overall trustworthiness and reliability of distributed software systems.  The project further aims to create approachable entry points to research, and to develop students' scientific communication skills, by integrating the creation of zines and videos about distributed systems verification into the investigator and project team's teaching and research practices, and making the resulting materials freely available online.<br/><br/>The project's approach to language-level distributed systems verification centers around refinement types: data types that let programmers specify logical predicates that restrict the set of values described by a type, and that can be checked at compile time by an SMT solver. The project uses Liquid Haskell, which extends the Haskell programming language with support for refinement types, and which can further be used for extrinsic verification, that is, defining functions to state and prove theorems. The investigator and team will use Liquid Haskell to develop mechanically verified, modular libraries for implementing distributed systems.  A novel verified message delivery library will form the foundation for additional verified components, such as libraries providing replicated data types and distributed data stores. Furthermore, the project investigates combining the strengths of Liquid Haskell with those of interactive proof assistants such as Agda. These investigations culminate in a comprehensive survey of such hybrid automated/interactive verification tools, and provide a holistic scientific understanding of the design space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But a few species have the unusual ability to move in all of these modes. To be this versatile, a multimodal animal must overcome the significant functional challenge of generating thrust in the divergent physical conditions of water, land, and air. Understanding how animals do this remarkable behavior remains unclear. This project studies trimodal freshwater insects  ? water boatmen, backswimmers, and diving beetles that swim, walk, and fly ? using a biomechanical approach. To visualize the ultrafast motion of their limbs and bodies in 3D, a cutting-edge high-speed video system that can be used in the lab or outside is being developed. During swimming and underwater walking, those limb motions move the water: by tracking precisely how the water moves, the investigator will calculate thrust and gain a mechanical understanding of the behaviors. Comparing three species allows investigation of the different pathways by which the behaviors, and the body shapes that allow them, may have evolved.  This research offers insights into the biology of movement versatility and the functional principles needed to invent bioinspired multimodal machines. Graduate students will be trained both in the cutting-edge techniques and in science communication and outreach, helping them integrate public service into their work from the beginning of their research careers. To put outreach into practice, graduate students will partner with two local nature centers to share insights with community members with projects designed to reach different demographics. <br/><br/>To understand how some freshwater insects manage to achieve trimodal locomotion, high-speed videography and laser-based flow velocimetry will be combined to build a complete, three-dimensional picture of the kinematics and fluid dynamics of (1) walking in air and underwater, (2) swimming, and (3) the swimming-to-flying transition. Operating at intermediate Reynolds numbers and moving between mediums, the study species offer opportunities to study transitional fluid dynamics, for example, in the scaling of drag-based paddling, a fundamental and widespread locomotor mechanism. This is the first study to measure high-resolution flow fields generated by the swimming of the target species, the first to measure 3D velocity fields of underwater walking in any arthropod, and the first to quantify water takeoff in conjunction with flight in insects. For the takeoff from water to flight, preliminary data suggest that the behavior is driven by both surface tension and aerodynamic forces. This work will shed new light on the general biomechanical principles of free surface locomotion by developing a methodology that permits simultaneous high-resolution temporal and spatial measurement of underwater velocity fields and above-water kinematics. In addition to the important broader impact of graduate student training, this project creates a new learning community for engineering graduate students that will support public outreach efforts, not only for this project, but also for many others, spanning the breadth of the mechanical engineering discipline. These efforts will be assessed as part of an educational study on how graduate students develop into holistic scholars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there are a variety of ways by which cells ensure genome integrity, recent studies have revealed new players in genome protection that consist of RNA molecules and RNA-associated proteins. Yet much remains to be understood about how these biomolecules function. Therefore, the goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of how RNA and RNA-associated proteins ensure the integrity of genomes through investigation of an RNA-based process in a single-celled organism that has long served as the basis of foundational discoveries in biology: Tetrahymena thermophila. The scientific insights afforded by this project are expected to have important implications for how diverse organisms, including humans, use RNA-based processes to protect their genomes and how disruptions to these processes may underlie disease. In addition, this project will provide opportunities to expand access to authentic research experiences and STEM professional development for undergraduate students at four primarily undergraduate institutions in the Northwest ? Western Washington University, Heritage University, Pacific University, and Carroll College. As these institutions serve a number of students who identify as members of underrepresented groups in STEM, the education aspects of this project are anticipated to promote the retention and success of diverse students in science, thereby strengthening our future scientific workforce.<br/><br/>Biological processes as diverse as cell division and differentiation, defense against viruses and transposons, and organismal development depend on RNA interference (RNAi) pathways. While RNAi is best understood as a mechanism that represses gene expression and ensures proper chromatin structure around centromeres, recent studies in diverse eukaryotes have uncovered new roles for RNAi factors in preventing or repairing DNA damage. The details of these new roles and how evolutionarily conserved they are remain to be fully elucidated. This project will investigate the mechanisms and genomic locations for a newly uncovered role for RNAi in maintaining genome integrity in the ciliated model eukaryote Tetrahymena thermophila.  This work will leverage established reverse genetic, fluorescence microscopy, and biochemical approaches developed or adapted for use in Tetrahymena. These studies have the potential to reveal both species-specific and broadly conserved mechanisms for RNAi-governed genome integrity, advancing our understanding of emerging roles for RNA in genome protection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Up through the 19th century, science was not a uniform discipline or practice?there were many ways to investigate and engage with nature, not all of which are considered within the ambit of modern science today, but which nevertheless shaped the objectives and practices of modern science. By broadening the conception of what science is and how it developed, this project investigates the scientific activities that were carried out at non-traditional sites, including monastic communities, trade transshipment ports, and manufacturing complexes. By studying these sites alongside more familiar institutions, such as scientific academies, this project widens the category of scientific activities to include pre-industrial processes and technologies and lays the essential preconditions for the development of a scientific culture. In doing so, it re-evaluates the relationship between theory and practice in science and considers the relationship of religion and a material conception of nature.  <br/><br/>Through archival research on the life and scholarship of natural philosopher, polymath, and popularizer of science Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov (1711-1765), this project examines three central questions: (1) what stimulated the rapid growth of science in the 18th century? (2) How should science be characterized in the 18th century, and who were its legitimate and extra-legitimate practitioners? (3) How were scientific methods and scientific authority codified, presented, and normalized in everyday discourse? Lomonosov?s life forms a lens through which the full history of science comes into sharper focus. Additionally, this study reveals Lomonosov?s efforts to create a science-literate public and cultivate trust in science and scientific authority. This account thus helps to historicize the promotion of scientific trust today. The results of this project will be shared through publications in scholarly and popular venues as well as through teaching.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multiple ?real? energy storage physics exist, such as batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, but are limited in energy or power bandwidth. Recently, modulated load control, particularly through flexible thermal loads, such as building HVAC systems or water heaters, has gained understanding and is regarded as ?virtual? storage, given its inherent existence as an energy buffer around a nominal load. A typical design of an energy storage system considers one or multiple storage physics and aggregates their respective electric models for control and energy management; this way overlooks the system-level picture and handles the complexity after it is created. This research explores a top-down co-design process by utilizing a universal energy storage electric model, combining real and virtual energy storage and connected power electronics. The proposed process directly yields optimal energy storage requirements among a cluster of energy storage options, and allows for most resiliency while reducing the complex energy management burden and sustaining an extended lifetime. The work will benefit many stakeholders in transportation electrification, utilities, and building sectors. Further, the project will enhance undergraduate and graduate curriculum by combining the advances in power electronics tied energy storage systems. The project will work with management consulting and international educational partners to train STEM students toward leadership and global vision. In addition, the project will reach out to local small businesses and Native American tribes to provide education in emerging energy storage technologies, thereby enabling pursuit of prosperous careers in the field.<br/><br/>This project develops a novel universal modeling and design framework for energy storage systems. Conventional heuristic selection of energy storage is suboptimal, dynamic interaction of real and virtual storage is lacking, the power electronics side of virtual energy storage is not well understood, and the lifetime impact of combined storage is not known. Fundamental research in modeling and design emphasizes bandwidth selections using an enhanced multi-timescale equivalent impedance network, followed by a co-design of connected power electronics, multi-objective optimization, dynamic energy management, and reliability analysis. Several machine learning-based methods in intelligent search, deep reinforcement learning, and big-data-driven control will also play a role in the work. Scientific knowledge will be gained through in-depth electrical-thermal-mechanical physics, modern power electronic converters and controls, emerging data science and artificial intelligence, and a hardware testbed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project utilizes visible-light solar energy to react waste carbon dioxide (CO2) to value-added chemicals such as methanol and formic acid.  Related research efforts to date have been hampered by low product selectivity, limitation to the UV light region, and inefficient photocatalytic mechanisms.  To overcome those limitations, the project will investigate a bifunctional photocatalyst design known as a heterojunction.  The heterojunction consists of a photothermal semiconductor photocatalyst interfaced with a metal-organic framework (MOF) material.  Integrating the two components in the heterojunction architecture enhances both the capture and conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals.  Beyond the technical aspects, the project will include educational and outreach activities designed to excite students about careers in STEM, with emphasis on opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The overall project goal is to engineer a bi-functional heterostructured photocatalyst for efficient CO2 photoconversion utilizing visible-light energy. The project is built on the hypothesis that the MOF component will enhance the CO2 uptake and provide the pore space needed to promote access to the catalytic sites on the photocatalyst. Under visible light irradiation, the photoexcited electrons from the photocatalyst will then reduce CO2 to the desired hydrocarbon products. The project includes four aims: 1) synthesize and characterize families of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 MOF and carbon@TiO2 photocatalyst of various particle size and core-shell properties; 2) develop a strategy to mediate MOF growth on the surface of the photocatalyst; 3) probe the interfacial structures of the carbon@TiO2@MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 photocatalyst; and 4) investigate the impact of the interface architecture on both selectivity control and the mechanism of photothermal catalytic CO2 conversion to C1 hydrocarbons.  A key feature of the carbon@TiO2 photocatalyst design is to promote photothermal efficiency via the heat capture and transfer associated with the carbon core combined with the light-harvesting and photoelectron-generating properties of the TiO2 shell.  Various methods will be employed in pursuing the four aims, including a range of photoelectrochemical techniques, spectroscopic methods, control and reaction experiments, and product analyses.   Properties of the photocatalyst and MOF will be characterized at each stage of synthesis, up to and including the bifunctional performance of the component materials in the integrated heterojunction design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, the vast majority (over 80%) of modern software systems are multi-language software. Meanwhile, software failures are known to be costly, and a common methodology for preventing these failures and reducing the cost is to reason about run-time behaviors of software (i.e., dynamic program reasoning). However, extant software-quality assurance support based on dynamic program reasoning still focuses on, and is limited to, software developed in single languages, largely dismissing what happens at and across language boundaries. As a result, cross-language behaviors are left unattended and holistic quality assurance of multi-language systems is critically lacking. This project aims to advance the state of knowledge about software-quality assurance by enabling practical dynamic program reasoning across language boundaries. The research will result in a new foundation of dynamic analysis and a series of application tools to diagnose cross-language correctness and security issues, which will help produce multi-language systems of improved quality. Moreover, this project will have an industrial impact realized through collaborations with and result disseminations via industrial partners, and will broaden the participation in computing of underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>The technical aims of the project are divided into three thrusts. First, multi-language code-construction mechanisms and their effects on the resulting software?s behavior and quality will be characterized. This will produce new knowledge about how modern multi-language software is constructed in terms of language selection and interoperation. Then, in the second thrust, practically scalable and cost-effective analyses for holistic cross-language dependence reasoning will be developed, as informed by the knowledge and insights gained from the characterization study. The key principle is to model and reason about cross-language code dependencies in a way that not only overcomes semantics disparities caused by language heterogeneity but also readily accommodates new/additional languages.

Even more importantly for applications (because in practice exact solutions are often not needed), it is computationally hard even to approximately solve some of these problems. The field that studies this topic, known as ""hardness of approximation,"" has progressed in leaps and bounds over the last two decades. One of the seminal achievements of the field was the forging of a deep connection between computational complexity and isoperimetric-type problems in geometry and probability. The isoperimetric problem in the plane -- which has been known and studied for more than 2 millenia -- asks which shape of a given area has a minimal perimeter (the answer: a circle). If there were a better understanding of certain probabilistic, high-dimensional variants of this problem, it would close several open problems in hardness of approximation. A better understanding of the limits of efficient approximate computation will in turn lead to better algorithms for real-world computational problems.<br/><br/>This project is about strengthening the link between hardness of approximation, geometry and probability. By solving new optimal partitioning problems in geometry and probability, the investigator will develop algorithms and prove new algorithmic hardness results. One of the difficulties with these partitioning problems is the presence of combinatorially many saddle points or local minima, but the investigator's recent resolution (with E. Milman) of the Gaussian double-bubble conjecture included a new method to circumvent this difficulty. Algorithmic consequences of these optimal partitioning problems include (i) improved bounds for testing and learning geometric concept classes; (ii) improved algorithms for non-interactive correlation distillation (a problem in cryptography with applications to random beacons and information reconciliation); and (iii) a stronger separation between classical and quantum communication complexity.

The human heart has limited capacity of repair after injury, and the lost cells are replaced by a fibrotic scar. The limited formation of blood vessels during cardiac fibrosis conditions significantly contributes to disease progression; vascularization in a damaged heart muscle is still a central and unresolved problem for cardiac muscle infarction repair. The objective of this CAREER proposal is to use a tissue engineering approach to develop precise diseased models to investigate vascular repair of damaged cardiac fibrotic tissue, and to integrate inclusive education and research training to every stage of the research work. This system will enable investigation of effective therapies for patients suffering with heart disease and the training component will broaden the participation of women and students from underrepresented backgrounds in science and engineering, eventually helping to diversify America's science and engineering workforce.<br/><br/>The investigator's long-term research goal is to advance strategies to engineer novel tissue models that mimic matrix remodeling and vascularization events during different pathophysiological conditions e.g., fibrosis progression after myocardial infarction, aiming to gain insight on tissue repair mechanisms and to ultimately establish new therapeutic approaches to control cardiac dysfunction and repair. Towards this goal, the aim of this CAREER project is to increase understanding of the mechanisms of vascularization in cardiac fibrosis conditions. The proposed 3D models will mimic important characteristics of the infarcted fibrotic cardiac tissue. The research objectives are to: (1) Engineer well-defined cardiac fibrosis models that recapitulate the remodeling process post-MI, (2) Determine/replicate the reciprocal influence of endothelial cells on the progression of cardiac fibrosis and the role of fibrosis on vascularization, and (3) Investigate the design of a vascularized engineered cardiac fibrosis model with flow that could help elucidate mechanisms to enhance cardiac vascularization and repair. The results obtained from this study will focus on two important aspects that limit the success of regenerative therapies for cardiac regeneration, the progression of fibrotic tissue remodeling and the optimal approach to promote sustained cardiac vascularization. This knowledge will contribute to the development of novel approaches to modulate the balance between pathological fibrosis and endogenous mechanisms of regeneration, including angiogenesis.

First, disparate social science and environmental engineering conversations on maintenance and repair will be connected to inform cross-disciplinary approaches to emissions mitigation. Second, a broadened understanding of the roles and effects of infrastructural retrofitting within the context of ongoing renewable energy transition projects will be emphasized.

However, braille displays are very expensive and are generally designed to display text only. The main reason for the high cost of the braille displays is the large number of braille cells used to provide tactile feedback. This research aims to identify how braille text and graphics can be effectively presented on the same platform integrated with a smartphone, using a small grid of tactile pins, at a much-reduced cost. A mobile tactile display will be developed that converts the images touched on the mobile screen to tactile images presented onto the fingertips of the user. This will help the blind/VI user feel the trends in charts and map directions providing access to vital information which currently needs to be printed out on embossed papers. Representing both braille and graphics on a display attached to a mobile device will help people with visual impairment explore a touchscreen as effectively as their sighted counterparts even in noisy environments where audio feedback is less reliable. This project will also address the braille literacy crisis by engaging the younger VI generation with tactile information presented through charts and trends and helping them realize the significance of braille over audio representations alone. The understanding gained from this research will enable the future development of wearable tactile displays and tactile texture representation on smartphones. The mobile tactile display will be tested on both VI and sighted users to study their adaptability towards the system. This project will also provide undergraduate and graduate engineering students an opportunity to participate in the complete development cycle of an assistive device, working in close collaboration with the VI individuals.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to integrate braille and graphics on the same platform, using a small dynamic tactile grid. This project will characterize user acceptability of a dynamic tactile system when the braille or graphical patterns are presented in a personalized manner (calibrated for user preferred vibration, slip-speed, etc.). An initial 6x6 refreshable tactile grid has been developed, with pin spacing adhering to braille standards and resolution capable of presenting straight lines and curves (or simple graphics). This initial prototype will be utilized to perform systematic studies on how VI read braille and graphics presented to stationary or semi-stationary fingers. The tactile patterns will be presented using different methods - sequential movements, column-wise, as well as simultaneously on the tactile display. The braille and graphics patterns will also be presented using stationary and vibrating pins, with and without sliding motion. A comparative study, between the finger movement while exploring freely on paper versus on the tactile display, will be performed to understand system limitations and possible enhancements. The effectiveness of each presentation method will be evaluated based on user response, response speed, comprehension, and likeability. The secondary goal of this project is the knowledge generation on how sighted users interact with passive tactile displays and their adaptability towards such systems. A mobile tactile display will be developed with software that converts touchscreen images into low-resolution simple graphics that continuously transfer graphics to tactile display. The efficacy of this system will be evaluated on 20 VI subjects, plus a few sighted users, to assess their ease of use, and ability to read and comprehend both braille text and mobile graphics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Angular momentum carrying acoustic waves, such as acoustic vortex beam, are a special type of sound waves that have a rotating pressure field or energy flux. Previous studies indicated that these waves could have many potential biomedical applications, including medical imaging with better resolution than traditional ultrasound imaging and targeted ultrasonic removal of kidney stones and blood clots with higher efficacy than classical focused ultrasound therapies. However, these studies focused on waves propagating underwater and ignored the anisotropy and heterogeneity of biomaterials such as muscle fibers. Recent theoretical studies have indicated that acoustic angular momenta will couple when propagating in anisotropic or heterogeneity materials, altering the propagation path of the wave, and potentially impeding their reliable use in the suggested biomedical applications. The research supported by this CAREER award seeks to understand the fundamental coupling mechanism between different acoustic angular momenta, especially when propagating in anisotropic biomaterials, through modeling and experimentation. This understanding will be applied to demonstrate imaging and blood clot thrombolysis capabilities through anisotropic media. The results from this research will advance knowledge in acoustics, dynamics, biomechanics, as well as biomedical engineering, and can potentially lead to novel medical diagnostics and therapies. This award will positively impact STEM education through collaboration with existing programs at Georgia Tech aimed to engage students and high school science teachers from the Atlanta Public Schools and Atlanta International School, especially from currently underrepresented groups, and to promote their participation in research.

Intrinstic and extrinsic acoustic waves become coupled when propagating in anisotropic materials, thus shifting the wave propagation trajectory. The central hypothesis of this research is that this coupling occurs through Coriolis effects resulting from rotations induced by the wave-medium interactions. The researchers will test this hypothesis in theoretical models and in experiments conducted underwater and in soft anisotropic media.  They will probe the ability to translate this understanding to the suggested imaging and thrombolysis capabilities experimentally using anisotropic tissue mimicking gels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, hydrogen is a cost-effective energy storage solution for intermittent renewable electricity generation and when long-term seasonal energy storage is required. Meeting ambitious goals of greenhouse gas and carbon emission reduction necessitates the maturation of electrochemical technologies that generate, store, and distribute hydrogen. This project seeks to understand how electrode polymeric binder materials in electrochemical hydrogen pumps (EHPs) affect the efficiency performance for hydrogen purification from challenging gas mixtures that contain low hydrogen concentrations (1% to 20%). This is important because it is posited that U.S.?s existing natural gas pipelines may have the ability to store and distribute hydrogen from centralized production facilities. Leveraging existing infrastructure can reduce the cost of hydrogen to end users as hydrogen storage and distribution make up a large portion of the cost of hydrogen today. However, endpoint use applications necessitate pure hydrogen at high pressures. Hence, EHPs are promising technology to separate hydrogen from gas mixtures while simultaneously compressing it. Advancing materials? performance and durability for electrochemical hydrogen pumps, such as electrode binders, can reduce capital costs for EHPs while also improving their energy efficiency. Electrochemical processes are poised to decarbonize chemical processes and is paramount to train future engineers proficient in electrochemical engineering and electrochemical systems integration. This project will commission the first electrochemical unit operation, an EHP, in Penn State?s Unit Operations Laboratory to give students hands-on training with electrochemical systems. Outreach activities for this project will engage and recruit individuals from rural communities in central Pennsylvania to teach them about sustainable chemical manufacturing using electrochemical systems.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this fundamental research project aims to understand how electrode ionomer binders? composition and processing influence hydrogen diffusivity and hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction kinetics in high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane (HT-PEM) electrochemical hydrogen pumps (EHPs). With the advent of ion-pair HT-PEMs and phosphonic acid ionomer electrode binders, preliminary experiments demonstrated hydrogen separations from syngas, and other reformed hydrocarbons with varying hydrogen and carbon monoxide concentrations, to +99.3% hydrogen at 1 A cm-2. In these experiments, it was observed that cell polarization was largely governed by hydrogen content in the gas mixture feed because CO poisoning was minimized. Addressing EHP cell polarization with gas feeds containing low hydrogen content requires new electrode binders that promote hydrogen diffusivity and foster better electrocatalyst utilization. This project will establish structure-property relationships that correlate ionomer composition and processing to reaction kinetics-transport properties. These ionomer electrochemical properties will be probed as thin films on interdigitated electrode arrays decorated with nanoscale electrocatalysts afforded from block copolymer templating. EHP studies with membrane electrode assemblies containing the new ionomers will be used for understanding cell polarization behavior for purifying hydrogen from gas mixtures with low hydrogen content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Death caused by hemorrhagic injuries may be preventable if critical care interventions are urgently and effectively deployed to restore lost blood volume. Fluid infusion dosages, including both rate and timing of administration, notably impact resuscitation outcomes. Under-dosing strategies are inefficient in restoring cardiac functions, whereas overly aggressive dosing regimens may lead to serious adverse events such as soft clots, thereby increasing mortality rates. Most existing dosing techniques are based on one-size-fits-all models or a small number of dose-response profiles. Such approaches sacrifice the control performance at the expense of robustness against inter-patient variability. A framework for identifying the correct dosage for each individual patient is currently lacking. This project will address this deficiency by developing a data-driven, integrated modeling and control framework for precision dosing that is able to resolve individual differences in dose response and predict optimal patient-specific dosing strategies, even with limited and noisy measurements. The knowledge advanced by this project may not only improve patient outcomes, but also significantly reduce costs associated with critical care services.

To accurately understand and mitigate the effects of soot, we need to understand all the processes related to soot formation and growth - from the inception of soot at an atomic level (aka atomic scale) to its maturation in real-world combustion systems at the device level (aka device scale). Unfortunately, such detailed multiscale modeling remains a daunting task. This leads to a significant gap of knowledge and significant uncertainty in the prediction and control of the emission of soot and its effects on the climate and public health. This project will create a framework of models to combine small-scale atomistic modeling with larger-scale engineering modeling of combustion systems. The project will enable a better predictive capability for modeling soot emission from combustion which will lead to cleaner combustion systems. The project will also provide a detailed insight into the properties of soot at an atomic level enabling a better understanding of the effects of soot on the planet. In so doing, the project will serve NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. The direct impacts of the technical work done in this project are two-fold. First, it will lead to a more complete understanding of the physics of soot inception and a detailed insight into the evolution of soot in the real world. Second, the developed multiphysics and multiscale modeling framework will open up a new horizon in the theoretical exploration of soot in combustion. The multiscale bridging strategies developed in this project can be adapted to other problems that require multiscale and multiphysics explorations. Along with the technical development, the project will also conduct outreach activities in collaboration with an art museum to encourage the community in fact- and data-based discourse on issues such as complexities of soot processes, the effect of soot on the society, environmental policies, and environmental justice, etc. Additionally, there will be activities involving high school students that will help promote scientific computing and encourage students to pursue STEM research. <br/> <br/>This project will bridge different domains of physics across different scales by utilizing novel computational approaches. At the atomic scale, this project will use techniques such as molecular dynamics to unravel the physics and chemistry of the soot inception. The results from these models along with high-resolution electron microscopic images of actual soot particles will be analyzed using machine learning techniques to create a novel stochastic soot modeling framework. This soot modeling framework will retain the detailed knowledge gained from atomic-scale models while efficiently operating at continuum-scale simulations such as in reacting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of combustion devices.

For example, 3D3C velocity is required for better understanding and better design of energy systems, including gas turbines, wind turbines, and hydrogen engines. 3D3C velocity is flow velocity in all three dimensions (3D) with all three components (3C) resolved.  Measuring this property is very important and considerable efforts have been invested to invent velocimetry techniques that can obtain 3D3C velocity measurements.  However, challenges remain in these measurements, especially around quantifiable accuracy and in reactive flows.  This project aims to enable quantitative 3D3C velocity measurements in reactive flows to pave the way for the design of cleaner energy solutions.  In addition, the project will be integrated into the researchers? daily teaching activities, K-12 outreach activities, design projects, and industrial collaborations.<br/><br/>Scientifically, the project will concentrate on one issue: the poorly-understood uncertainties of our current 3D3C velocimetry techniques in reactive flows.  This project proposes to resolve this issue and enable quantitative 3D3C velocity measurements in 3 progressive steps. Step I aims at understanding existing techniques? uncertainties at a fundamental level. This step will design novel experiments so that the ground truth velocity can be known a priori and the errors can be directly quantified. Based on Step I, Step II then aims at inventing new strategies to significantly improve the accuracy of 3D3C velocimetry. Preliminary results have identified several promising ideas including new tomographic reconstruction algorithms and active correction of beam-steering caused by turbulence. And finally, Step III proposes to apply the new understanding from Steps I and II and new strategies to interpret existing data to establish a new database with enhanced accuracy and well-defined error bars for the community. Velocity is the most basic property both as a key input and a key output for model comparison. The quantitative 3D3C results sought in this project are expected to be a valuable database for the research community, both to validate existing models and also to inspire new insights and new models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these basic rules of life do not seem to apply to insects that live in social groups. For example, queens of some ants, bees, and termites can live for years or even decades, despite laying thousands or hundreds of thousands of eggs, but their sterile sisters and daughters live for just days or weeks. The mechanisms underlying this drastic departure from otherwise universal life history trade-offs are unknown, in part due to limitations in the types of species that have been studied. This project will focus on wild bees to determine how variation in sociality influences how bees balance investment in reproduction, health, and longevity. By expanding the breadth (number of species) and depth (ecologically relevant experiments within a key species) of analysis, the project will provide unique insights into how bees optimize fitness under changing environmental conditions, which is critical for mitigating issues related to global food security in the face of pollinator decline. The project will provide training and mentorship for students (undergraduate and graduate) and a postdoctoral researcher. Training will specifically target Native American students from a regional campus to broaden participation in STEM through mentorship in a summer research program and fellowship. Results generated from the research will be used to develop guided experiential learning modules in an upper division/graduate course called Genes and Behavior. <br/><br/>Life history theory has been a guidepost for interpreting variation in behavior and ecology through an evolutionary framework, but social insects seem to break the rules by escaping classic tradeoffs between fecundity and longevity. This suggests that social evolution influences life history evolution, fundamentally altering what seem to be otherwise basic constraints in how life history strategies can vary. The team will investigate how wild bees invest in life history traits (immunity, reproduction) as a function of variation in the ecological and social environment in three sets of experiments. First, internal and external immunity will be assayed in multiple bee species to test alternative hypotheses for how the evolution of eusociality has shaped investment in immune function. Second, the focus will shift to a facultatively eusocial bee (Megalopta genalis) that allows direct comparison of life history tradeoffs in solitary and social individuals under the same ecological conditions. Comparing immune response, oxidative stress, and gene expression profiles in three tissues between solitary and social females before and after offspring emergence will take advantage of natural differences in energy reserves to see how access to resources influences investment in survival (i.e., immunity, senescence, mortality risk) and reproduction, as well as the molecular pathways underpinning these traits. A final set of experiments will test these findings directly by experimentally removing the workers from social M. genalis nests and measuring the effects on queen survival, reproduction, and their underlying mechanisms. These activities will identify the mechanisms by which social evolution influences life history evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Next generation computing and communications are essential for the continued economic prosperity of the United States. Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition is a scalable manufacturing process for the precision synthesis of thin films for microelectronics. While widely used for optical and electronic devices, this manufacturing process is not well-developed for the synthesis of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. This research will develop the knowledge needed to provide control over the detailed atomic arrangement of the atoms in these two-dimensional materials on an industrial scale, required for the incorporation of these materials into advanced electronic systems. These materials exhibit two dominant atomic arrangements which are referred to as the polytype or phase. The specific phase dictates the physical properties of the material and potentially could be selected for use in the formation of components necessary to address the voltage, interconnect, and dimensional scaling issues in current and future microelectronics. This award supports innovation in manufacturing through basic research and technology development of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition that will lead to precision in the selection of the desired material phase during synthesis. Achieving phase-sensitive process control will pave the way to realize new high speed and low energy consuming microelectronic devices. This research program provides educational activities aimed at developing the next generation of material processing graduates and the future leaders in microelectronic materials in the United States. Outreach activities to increase the diversification of the workforce in advanced materials manufacturing will be pursued by improving the transfer pathway of students from community colleges to 4-year university Materials Science and Engineering programs.<br/><br/>This research program investigates an advanced manufacturing approach to achieve phase selectivity and control during the epitaxial growth of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide materials by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. This research program will specifically study the non-equilibrium growth of these materials using steady-state light illumination: (i) to manipulate the population of free carriers during synthesis and thus the formation energy of point defects; (ii) to influence the surface kinetics of mobile species and thus the phase equilibria of these materials; and (iii) to change the chemical trajectory as well as reaction pathways that will ultimately impact which polymorph phase is stabilized during growth. The research program will provide a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the phase selectivity during epitaxial growth. These two-dimensional materials could be used in reconfigurable, electrically tunable, low energy and low voltage switching devices based on phase transformation between the different polytypes. This research program will develop real-time, in situ optical diagnostics of the materials synthesis process to characterize and track the evolution of individual phases during synthesis. The information from the initial materials system can be used to understand the complex chemical processes present throughout the synthesis of other two-dimensional materials under non-equilibrium conditions. A particular phase of interest could be selectively produced for integration into a variety of microelectronic logic and memory designs.

To accelerate this fundamental shift for buildings subject to extreme windstorms, this project will create a first-of-its-kind technology for the implementation of performance-based wind design by leveraging recent breakthroughs in computational modeling of inelastic dynamic systems and uncertainty propagation, therefore resulting in tools that explicitly ensure (1) enhanced resilience of buildings and other structures to future windstorms and (2) the stakeholder need for cost effectiveness.

The technology will provide, for the first time, a tangible means for design engineers to evaluate the system-level inelastic performance of buildings and other structures subject to extreme winds through the limit states of dynamic shakedown and/or incipient collapse. This will enable the assessment of building systems against failure due to ratcheting, low cycle fatigue, and/or instantaneous plastic collapse, the evaluation of which is recognized as key to achieving greater resilience against extreme windstorms at reduced costs to stakeholders. By advancing stress resultant plasticity and hybrid computing, uncertainty propagation schemes will enable direct evaluation of reliability at the performance objectives of dynamic shakedown and incipient collapse, metrics at the very core of advanced performance-based wind design.

The lack of low-loss and scalable quantum optical devices such as quantum optical sources and memories is a major obstacle in building a large-scale quantum network. Another challenge is efficient and multiplexed generation, storage and distribution of quantum information (e.g. entanglement).

The aqueous speciation of many metal contaminants is controlled by binding onto sulfur-based binding sites on bacteria and on dissolved organic matter. Despite the importance of these sulfur-based binding sites, very little is known about the abundance of the sites in natural waters or the processes that affect their abundance primarily due to analytical difficulties in measuring the concentration of these site types. In this study, we will use an analytical approach that we have developed for measuring sulfur-based binding sites both in water and sediment samples from a wide range of environments. The research will be transformative by providing baseline information that can be used to assess the importance of sulfur-based sites in controlling metal speciation and behavior in natural and human-impacted water systems. Furthermore, the ability to measure the sulfur-based binding site concentrations in aqueous samples and on environmental solid-phase surfaces at the sensitivity of our new approach enables the investigators to test several hypotheses about the role of these important sites in surface and near-surface water-rock systems. The sponsored research project will involve outreach and coordination with local high school science research programs in South Bend, Indiana schools. A geomicrobiology/environmental chemistry module will be created and taught in these high school science research programs (a short-course of 3-4 lectures and demonstrations), and 2-3 high school students will be recruited each year to conduct some of the sample analyses. <br/><br/>Organic compounds with sulfhydryl metal-binding sites are ubiquitous in natural and engineered surface water, groundwater, and soil settings, yet the role that they play in controlling the environmental behavior and fate of metals is poorly understood due to the difficulty of measuring their concentrations in aqueous and solid samples. Although other binding site types are typically more abundant, sulfhydryl sites likely control the fate, transport, and bioavailability of chalcophile elements in the environment due to the much higher binding affinities that these elements have with sulfhydryl sites compared to with other binding site types. A first step in determining the role of organo-sulfhydryl binding sites in controlling metal speciation and bioavailability in natural systems is to measure the total concentration of these site types in surface and groundwaters and on environmental surfaces. Total sulfhydryl site concentrations in natural waters are likely to be, typically, in the nM to ?M range, but sulfhydryl sites at these concentrations are not directly detectable using current approaches. In this study, the investigators will use a novel ultra-high performance liquid chromatography ? mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analytical approach that they have developed and tested for measuring total sulfhydryl site concentrations in aqueous and solid-phase samples, and conduct a survey of sulfhydryl site concentrations in a wide range of environments. The UHPLC-MS approach dramatically lowers the detection limit relative to previous analytical methods, measuring the total sulfhydryl site concentration in a sample indirectly by measuring the change in concentration, upon exposure to sulfhydryl sites, of a molecule that binds specifically and essentially irreversibly to sulfhydryl sites on aqueous molecules or solid phase surfaces. Because the concentration of the sulfhydryl-binding molecule can be determined very precisely using UHPLC-MS, the analytical approach has the potential to lower the detection limit for total sulfhydryl site concentration measurements by 2-3 orders of magnitude over current state-of-the-art techniques and to obtain detection limits of approximately 10 nM. The research team will use this approach to test several hypotheses about the role and occurrence of sulfhydryl sites in lake systems and on soil, microbiological, and root systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There has recently been an exciting surge in technology aimed at restoring lost mobility; prostheses, orthoses, and exoskeletons are more reliable, precise, and biomimetic than ever. Unfortunately, the impact and clinical acceptance of these assistive devices is limited by an inability to attach them safely and comfortably to the body. This is a particular challenge for the nearly two million Americans living with limb amputation. Current prosthetic attachment systems are uncomfortable, restrict motion, and require regular clinical adjustment. To address these limitations, this project will advance a new attachment system that improves the mechanical interface between arm prostheses and the body. The project?s goal is to create prosthetic suspension systems that are safer and more comfortable, fit better, and require less frequent adjustment in the clinic. In addition to the direct impacts of this research, the project team will seek to increase disability awareness among undergraduate students and medical trainees, by incorporating principles from the proposed work into formal course curricula and inviting undergraduates and medical trainees to participate in research, clinic visits, and relevant surgical procedures. The PI Team will also work closely with a student-led professional organization called the Society for Engineers Experiencing Disabilities, which was founded by one of lead graduate students on the project; this student plans to present their progress in the proposed research at seminars to undergraduate and K-12 students to emphasize the crucial role of people with disability in STEM.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this work is to establish an adaptive fixation strategy for assistive devices that effectively transmits forces to the human body, while preventing large soft-tissue strains and eliminating relative body-device motion. Toward this end, this project will advance a new system that uses electromagnetics to transmit loads from a prosthetic limb directly to the residual bone of persons with limb amputation. The research goals are to i) measure and model attachment force requirements for above-elbow prostheses during activities of daily living, ii) determine the relationship between electromagnet design parameters and system performance, and iii) evaluate large-gap electromagnetic force control strategies. These experiments will elucidate the biomechanical and operational requirements for electromagnetic suspension of limb prostheses. The proposed work is also expected to produce technical knowledge that applies to other assistive devices, as well as to non-rehabilitation applications involving large-gap electromagnetic control. This research has the potential to advance the field of assistive technology by improving the comfort, safety, and effectiveness of chronic load transfer from prosthetic devices. Additionally, the proposed approach challenges the conventional design paradigm for assistive devices, emphasizing parallel engineering of body and machine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However the proposed  deep-learning models still face many input programs that are beyond a model?s handling capability due to  many reasons (e.g., evolution of the program code).  Because of the lack of understanding about these inputs, many software-engineering applications in industrial practice still make decisions based on symbolic-reasoning systems where decision logic and rules are hard-coded by a human. Human intelligence (e.g., rules summarized by humans) tends to be simplistic and reductionistic, while deep-learning models can be opaque and overfitted.  If one can somehow combine the best of the two worlds, many existing challenges will disappear. Therefore, this proposal seeks to make progress on such a combination.  <br/><br/>The broad goal of this proposal is to design a general framework that improves deep-learning models? handling of input programs by incorporating human intelligence. Specifically, two main issues are faced by existing deep-learning models in handling code data: (1) lack of understanding about inherent nature of code data, and (2) lack of domain-specific knowledge of software-engineering tasks. To address these fundamental limitations, this project proposes to design a general, user-driven learning-based framework. In the short term, this  project aims to  improve  the  practicality  of  intelligent code-analysis  techniques  and  facilitate  the adoption of deep learning techniques in code analysis.

When combined with powerful approximation schemes (e.g., deep neural networks), RL has been effective in highly complex tasks traditionally considered beyond reach of Artificial Intelligence. However, its sensitivity to the approximation parameters makes RL difficult to use (significant Machine Learning expertise is demanded of the programmer) and difficult to trust (manual approximations can invalidate guarantees). The vision of this project is to democratize RL by developing principled methodologies and powerful tools to improve the usability and trustworthiness of RL-based programming at scale. These research objectives are complemented by efforts to integrate the foundations of RL-based computability in CS education and to explore the role of RL-based programming in CS education.<br/><br/>Approximation in RL is needed because RL algorithms with guaranteed convergence work on finite MDPs, and yet scale poorly. Approximation affects usability and trustworthiness. This proposal identifies two goals addressing both concerns: 1) to discover convergent RL beyond finite MDPs and 2) to develop abstraction-based approaches for RL with rigorous optimization guarantees. The success of the proposed approaches will be evaluated by their ability to handle systems at scale. The algorithms and datasets will be disseminated as open-source software.

In North America, these animals include herbivores such as deer, elk, moose, and bison. These grazers have profound effects on grasslands and forests. Ecosystem processes such as plant production, nutrient cycling, and carbon storage can vary widely due to herbivores. Understanding the factors controlling that variation is critical for management of the ecosystems that support these animals. Unfortunately, the forces causing spatial and temporal variation on grazed grasslands are poorly understood. This project helps fill that knowledge gap by analyzing a large amount of data gathered over more than three decades in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). The project also provides valuable public access to a unique dataset, training opportunities for undergraduate students, and outreach to the public as well as to National Park Service scientists, managers, and interpretive staff.<br/><br/>The effects of migratory herds of elk and bison on grassland soil and plant processes have been measured in YNP since 1988. Over that period, 11 different field experiments were conducted at 42 different grassland sites. Together those independent data sets include measurements of herbivore effects on key plant and soil processes. A wide range of plant community types, soil conditions and climate conditions are represented. There are three goals of the project: (1) to compile the data collected in YNP into a single data set and upload it to a platform for public access, (2) to determine the relative effects of climate, plant composition, soil properties, and herbivores on ecosystem processes, and (3) to use the DayCent model to study the effects of these processes on soil carbon storage in YNP grasslands. The synthesis of the data provides a rare opportunity to mechanistically understand how both spatial and temporal variability interact with large herbivores to determine grassland plant and soil processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These storms come in various types or ?modes? that differ in the type and severity of the hazards they produce, but otherwise form in similar environments. In particular, discrete, rotating storms known as supercells produce the most severe tornadoes and largest hail, but the environmental conditions in which they form are very similar to those that support severe squall lines, which tend to produce large swaths of damaging straight-line winds. How a given severe weather scenario plays out also depends on poorly understood details of the early stages of storm development. For these reasons it remains difficult to anticipate which modes will be dominant leading up to a given severe weather event. Using many sophisticated computer simulations and comparing them with the behavior of real-world storms, this project will investigate how severe storm mode depends on the details of early storm development across a range of different environments. The results of this investigation will aid forecasters in their ability to discriminate between environments and details of early storm development that are most likely to produce a given storm mode and its associated severe weather. An additional aspect of this project is the application of emerging and affordable virtual reality technology to the simulation results to visualize the complex 3D structures of these storms. These platforms will be leveraged to develop interactive educational spaces designed to engage students from a high school to college level.<br/><br/>The first goal of this project is to fill a major gap in our understanding of how severe convective storms (SCS) develop, persist, and produce severe hazards as a function of their large-scale environment (LSE), the small-scale details of their initiation and interaction, and the links between them. Using a large suite of idealized storm-scale numerical simulations, this project will 1) investigate the sensitivity of SCS mode to the morphology of convective initiation across a range of LSE?s, 2) determine the role of convective cold pools in modulating supercell vs. QLCS modes in different LSE?s, and 3) investigate the variability of tornado development, longevity, and intensity as a function of storm mode and LSE.  More broadly, results of this study will improve our understanding of how mid-latitude continental convection operates within the climate system and will help inform future avenues in the modeling of past, present, and future climate. The other goal of this study is to develop interactive virtual reality-based 3D visualizations of simulated storms to make their complex structure and behavior more accessible and intuitive to students and researchers alike. This effort aims to increase public engagement the STEM community.  It will specifically target both the undergraduate classroom and develop outreach events to high schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This growing demand has highlighted the importance for all K-12 students to develop an understanding of AI to prepare them for future careers. Middle school years are crucial in shaping youth dispositions toward STEM. There is an urgent need nationally to develop a deep educational understanding of how to engage students during these years in learning AI and how to train and support teachers in AI education. The need to provide AI learning experiences is especially pronounced in rural areas, where students often lack access to advanced STEM educational opportunities. This project will introduce AI concepts to middle school students and teachers through summer camps, workshops, and school-based programs in rural communities of North Carolina. Over the course of the project, through co-design cycles with students and teachers, the project will iteratively develop an AI learning environment. With a focus on fostering students' creative expression, the learning environment will infuse AI learning into interactive digital game design activities that enable students to create personally meaningful and relevant game scenarios. In partnership with Boys & Girls Clubs in North Carolina, the project will offer summer camps for youth from underrepresented and underserved populations. The project will investigate which AI principles and concepts in the context of learning digital game development are most appropriate and engaging, and what are the support and scaffolding that teachers will require in integrating AI education into their instructional designs. The project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts, and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>The project will provide AI learning experiences to over 500 middle school students and AI-focused professional development to more than 20 teachers. Researchers will address three research questions: (1) How can we create engaging AI learning experiences for diverse rural populations of middle school students through game design activities? (2) How do we best support teachers in integrating AI learning experiences in their school-based programs? and (3) What is the impact of the learning program on diverse populations of rural middle grade students' knowledge of AI concepts, attitudes toward AI, and interest in AI careers? The project will leverage a design-based research approach to iteratively refine the program called AI Play, including the AI concepts to be addressed, the features to incorporate in the learning environment, and the scaffolding tools and pedagogical approaches to utilize. The research will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods such as surveys, assessments, analysis of student artifacts, focus groups, and field observations to determine how the program impacts targeted outcomes for students and teachers. The deliverables of the project will include the AI Play program model and its associated curricular materials, the professional development model and its associated materials, the AI Play community website, and the research findings from the project. The aims of the project are to build knowledge on how to best help rural students develop foundational knowledge of AI concepts, how to promote meaningful explorations of AI for rural students, and design principles for creating engaging AI learning experiences that lead to increased student interest in AI-intensive fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major outstanding challenge lies in designing interfaces between optical and matter-based quantum systems that can preserve fragile quantum states. Such interfaces are necessary for a wide variety of tasks, including generating light suitable for carrying quantum information, storing and retrieving photonic qubits, and mediating entangling operations between photons. Achieving these goals generally requires enhancing the strength of the light-atom interaction, which is naturally too weak for efficient quantum devices. A common method to enhance this interaction is to couple the atoms to an optical resonator or cavity, typically a precisely fabricated structure designed for a single application. The research proposed here aims to develop a dynamically reconfigurable platform for coupling atoms to an optical cavity by using highly coherent, cryogenically-cooled rare-earth atom dopants in a solid-state host that can be spectrally and spatially tailored to form the cavity mirrors and the coupled atomic ensemble. This flexible platform can be used for a variety of important applications, such as efficient and long-lived quantum memory for light, and can be incorporated into integrated optical devices. In addition, a new undergraduate research fellowship that targets students interested in quantum science and engineering from underrepresented backgrounds will be developed, with a focus on ensuring supportive mentorship that extends beyond the summer research experiences.<br/><br/>Technical: The objective of the proposed work is to develop a dynamically reconfigurable cavity quantum electrodynamics system based on a spatially and spectrally tailored ensemble of highly coherent, cryogenically-cooled, rare-earth atom dopants in a solid-state host, which forms both the cavity mirrors and the coupled atoms. Rare-earth atoms in solids at cryogenic temperatures exhibit highly coherent atom-like behavior and an energy level structure that makes them suited to precise tailoring of their spatial and spectral profile via spectral hole-burning. A one-dimensional array of alternating spectral profiles acts as a highly reflective optical mirror. Furthermore, the presence of multiple metastable energy levels enables dynamic, optically controlled switching of the mirror between reflective and transmissive states via electromagnetically induced transparency. Additional spectral and spatial tailoring can enable more complex structures including optical cavities that can be coupled to each other and to  ensembles of atoms. Thus a fully reconfigurable cavity quantum electrodynamics system is formed without any fabricated structures, with the additional feature of dynamically switchable cavity mirrors. This scheme will enable dramatic improvement in the efficiency of rare-earth ensemble-based optical quantum memory to store photonic qubits. Rare-earth atoms are already one of the most promising platforms for quantum memory and coupling a rare-earth ensemble to an optical cavity addresses outstanding challenges related to making compact devices with long storage times without sacrificing storage efficiency. And doing so in a way that is reconfigurable without the need to fabricate a cavity makes this a flexible platform for a wide variety of useful quantum devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For wireless devices to become an essential part of our infrastructure, they must be resilient to changing environmental conditions and function under extreme cases. However, current wireless protocols have limited adaptability. This project explores a new class of wireless protocols called ?wireless sub-protocols?. Wireless sub-protocols are new protocols built on existing wireless protocols but increase their capabilities and adaptability. Wireless sub-protocols are implemented only in software and require no changes to a device?s hardware. Wireless sub-protocols add extra adaptability paving the way for future resilient wireless protocols with only a software update.<br/><br/>More flexibility in wireless protocols is necessary to accommodate the ever-expanding use cases that new wireless devices demand and bring about ultra-resilient wireless systems. To address the need for adaptability and resiliency, this project explores the novel idea of building a wireless protocol layering approach where additional functionality is added to a wireless protocol using ?wireless sub-protocols?. A wireless sub-protocol is a protocol built on top of another wireless protocol. A wireless sub-protocol provides a way for a base protocol to increase its abilities beyond what the original protocol designers intended. A communication scheme can be built on top of an existing protocol by measuring and controlling the physical layer properties in user space software. This innovative technique allows a device to gain new capabilities and thus adaptability, with only a software update. Sub-protocols coexist with the base protocol, allowing the application developer to decide when to use one or the other. This project will build a framework for prototyping, building, and testing different types of wireless sub-protocols. The project will use wireless testbeds to prototype new wireless sub-protocols rapidly. This project will enable a new research area of wireless sub-protocols, impacting future designs of wireless devices. The technology the project develops will be available to technical standardization committees to formalize approaches to wireless sub-protocols.

Understanding the factors controlling that variation is critical for management of the ecosystems that support these animals. Unfortunately, the forces causing spatial and temporal variation on grazed grasslands are poorly understood. This project helps fill that knowledge gap by analyzing a large amount of data gathered over more than three decades in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). The project also provides valuable public access to a unique dataset, training opportunities for undergraduate students, and outreach to the public as well as to National Park Service scientists, managers, and interpretive staff.<br/><br/>The effects of migratory herds of elk and bison on grassland soil and plant processes have been measured in YNP since 1988. Over that period, 11 different field experiments were conducted at 42 different grassland sites. Together those independent data sets include measurements of herbivore effects on key plant and soil processes. A wide range of plant community types, soil conditions and climate conditions are represented. There are three goals of the project: (1) to compile the data collected in YNP into a single data set and upload it to a platform for public access, (2) to determine the relative effects of climate, plant composition, soil properties, and herbivores on ecosystem processes, and (3) to use the DayCent model to study the effects of these processes on soil carbon storage in YNP grasslands. The synthesis of the data provides a rare opportunity to mechanistically understand how both spatial and temporal variability interact with large herbivores to determine grassland plant and soil processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although this business model is promising, it also brings in security concerns since the public commercial cloud cannot be fully trusted. For example, public commercial clouds may sell clients' sensitive data to third parties. In this project, the investigator develops a scheme to enable secure and privacy-preserving machine learning services over the encrypted database in cloud storage. The project's broader significance and importance are two-fold. First, the project extends the border of cloud computing services and brings in new business growth possibilities that enable safer and privacy-preserving AI analyses on data stored in public clouds. Second, the project engages female and under-represented minority students in computing, thus fostering the 21st-century data-capable workforce.<br/> <br/>In this project, the investigator develops a scheme to support secure ML queries over encrypted databases in cloud storage by employing an index-aid approach.

For each data item, a secure index item that can support ML analyses is generated. Therefore, this scheme achieves strong ciphertext privacy and ML capability simultaneously, as well as index, model, and token privacy. In summary, this project makes two significant technical contributions. First, the development of an index-aid approach that addresses the conflict between data security and utility.

Research shows that students of color experience stagnation and downward achievement in mathematics already by the 3rd grade due primarily to poverty or limited educational opportunities, making it difficult for them to imagine a career in the STEM field. This project focuses on this critical issue by developing innovative age-appropriate mathematics curriculum using robotics technology as a platform.   Culturally relevant robot coding activities will be co-designed with teachers and implemented in their classrooms. The project will also engage minority STEM professionals who use robotics in their careers to serve as role models for students. The project is a partnership between Teachers College of Columbia University, Vision Education & Media, a community-based STEM organization, and two NYC Title I schools. Findings will inform researchers on how culturally relevant robot coding activities may link to student?s mathematics learning, engagement, and interest in mathematics. For practitioners, the findings will contribute to better understanding of how to design, develop, and implement short culturally relevant coding activities into standard-based mathematics curriculum.<br/><br/>Using a design-based research approach, the project will generate new knowledge about whether, and how, urban Black and Latinx elementary school students can increase mathematics achievement by engaging in short culturally relevant robot coding activities.

The project will also explore a new approach to professional development by involving teachers in co-designing robot coding activities directly linked to experiences and cultures of their students. The development, testing, and implementation of the new supplemental curriculum takes a central role in this project and involves an interdisciplinary research team. Multiple forms of data (e.g. teacher artifacts, observations, interviews, and student surveys, achievement data, focus group discussions) will be used to compile multidimensional portraits of engagement and practice related to culturally relevant math pedagogy and curriculum design (from the teachers) and math interest and learning (from the students).

Several studies have identified changes in brain tissue composition as key factors in regulating acute and chronic inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Due to the dynamic changes, the relationship between changes in brain tissue composition and neuroinflammation remains unclear.   This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award will investigate the relationship between changes in brain tissue composition and neuroinflammation. To enable this study, a biomaterial platform will be developed to study the abnormal behavior of human cells, called astrocytes, in CNS tissue triggered by changes in tissue composition. The execution of this project will provide undergraduate students with hands-on experience to develop problem-solving, laboratory, and leadership skills and to promote the STEM disciplines among at-risk middle/high school students. <br/><br/>Several studies have identified the extracellular matrix (ECM) as a key factor in regulating acute and chronic inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Tissue damage due to aging, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegeneration causes changes in the composition of the ECM. These changes result in tissue degradation and remodeling. Molecules, such as hyaluronic acid, are degraded into bioactive fragments, while components of blood plasma, such as fibrinogen, are deposited in the form of fibrin. Astrocytes adjacent to injured tissue proliferate and become reactive in response to ECM changes. Currently, the relationship between changes in brain tissue ECM and neuroinflammation remains unclear due to dynamic composition of the ECM. To study the molecular mechanism of ECM components on the inflammatory response of CNS cells, new models are needed. This project will provide a proof-of-principle for the fabrication of a 3D in vitro model to study the onset and progression of inflammatory signaling in human astrocytes. Multi-interpenetrating polymer networks (mIPNs), comprised of fibrin, hyaluronic acid high molecular weight (HA-HMW), collagen type I, and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate will be used as 3D scaffolds to mimic key changes in matrix composition (fibrin and HA-HMW content) and to study their effect on astrocyte reactivity and inflammatory response. The proposed scaffolds will be made using a network-by-network fabrication approach. Orthogonal crosslinking mechanisms will be used to control the crosslinking process dynamically and chronologically, allowing for the modulation of scaffold rigidity, physical stability, and cell morphology. This work will demonstrate that the proposed in vitro model can be used to uncover key elements connecting ECM remodeling and the reactive and inflammatory response of human astrocytes. In the long term, the development and validation of the proposed 3D model will further contribute to the design, testing, and evaluation of new therapeutic molecules to treat CNS tissue damage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the strength and behavior of rock and soil is necessary for safe and cost-effective designs, with applications ranging from robust infrastructure (roads, buildings, dams, tunnels, etc.) to sustainable development of energy and mineral resources, all of which are essential to society. News coverage of recent failures of natural slopes and tailings dams has raised public awareness and concern across the globe. Although such disasters have significant negative consequences, study of them enables improved understanding, allowing for improved safety in the future. This Boosting Research Ideas for Transformative and Equitable Advances in Engineering (BRITE) Synergy project aims to improve our ability to predict seismically induced rock slope failures so they can be addressed prior to a triggering earthquake event. Laboratory experiments will be combined with numerical simulations to enhance our ability to predict and prevent seismically-induced rock slope failures. In addition to the benefit to society via improved safety during earthquakes, the project supports the professional development and research goals of a female PI and a set of students from groups currently underrepresented in science and engineering. In particular, this project will provide the opportunity for the PI and her students to engage with new techniques and technologies as they perform the experiments and simulations and interpret the results, ranging from acoustic emissions instrumentation to hybrid finite-discrete element numerical models.<br/><br/>The research goals will largely be accomplished via experimental work with two related thrusts: development of an improved direct shear test procedure for characterizing the shear strength of rock joint surfaces, and implementation of a suite of shake table tests to investigate the motion of rock blocks under seismic loading conditions. The associated experimental datasets will be archived and shared via the DesignSafe repository. The dataset containing the direct shear test results will allow the global rock mechanics community to more readily adopt the improved test procedure and the dataset containing yield accelerations and block displacements will provide a validation tool that will be of use to earthquake engineering researchers and practitioners worldwide. Numerical models will be used to augment the experimental datasets using continuum, discontinuum, and hybrid methods, allowing exploration of a wider variety of conditions than can be simulated in the laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

TMS uses magnetic fields to deliver pulses that create temporary electric fields in the brain. The magnetic pulses are delivered over the scalp and the created electric fields can stimulate nerve cells in the brain regions where the pulse is delivered. Stroke is a medical condition where a lack of blood supply of a specific brain region results in nerve cell death that can affect the brain connections that control movement. Stroke is one of the main causes of disability that impacts the quality of life of millions of people. Many studies have investigated the use of TMS to assess the human motor system and to develop therapies for stroke. TMS is ideal for this because it allows for the measurement of the connection and transfer of brain signals between the motor cortex in the brain and the muscles. Also, TMS is a promising therapeutic tool to improve recovery and re-learning of motor control after stroke. However, despite the possible advantages of TMS-based brain stimulation therapies, the treatment outcomes vary considerably and not all patients benefit. In this project, the investigators will develop improved methods to measure and analyze brain signals to better adjust the TMS procedure to each individual patient?s brain motor system for better and more precise assessments and therapies for stroke survivors. The investigator will develop new educational materials, 3-D printed models, and hold workshops to teach these methods to a wide range of individuals including local high school students.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to develop individualized TMS applications for assessing the motor system in adult stroke patients and future rehabilitation efforts. This will be based on (i) individual anatomical characterization using structural MRI and (ii) individual functional characterization employing electroencephalography (EEG), combined with (iii) advanced computational modeling. Ongoing oscillatory brain states, highlighting local brain excitability, will be tracked in real-time by EEG and be used to apply TMS in a closed-loop fashion. The PI will leverage these technological developments to advance TMS technology to assess motor circuitry and advance the field?s understanding of brain pathologies in stroke, thus enabling future clinical trials for stroke rehabilitation. This project will result in next-generation technology that will allow principled TMS studies of brain circuits in stroke with high spatial and temporal resolution. This will be based on advances in image and signal processing initially established for healthy individuals and translation towards individuals with stroke. Through initial experimental testing, it will be ensured that technological advances will result in improved practical applications. Outcomes of this research will result in new approaches for closed-loop TMS in individuals with stroke. Success in these efforts will allow the design and execution of more precise brain stimulation protocols for the assessment of motor circuits and TMS stroke rehabilitation protocols.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In most organisms, RNA is copied from DNA and directs protein synthesis without changes in the code. However, in trypanosomal mitochondria (the ?powerhouse? of cells), RNA is edited extensively by addition or removal of specific nucleotides. In their complex life cycle, trypanosomes alternate between two very different hosts: humans (and other animals) and insects, which are the vectors of tranmission. The dramatically different environments that the parasites face in humans and insects demand rapid and large-scale metabolic and physiological changes, including in RNA editing. The crucial question of how the RNA editing mechanism is precisely regulated during parasite development remains unanswered and is the focus of this research. The project will have broad educational impact by providing interdisciplinary training opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, with a focus on groups traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This project focuses on Trypanosoma brucei mRNA editing regulation and the key role of the REH2C complex that controls editing fidelity in editosomes. The research can shed new light on a question that has remained a mystery for decades: how is mRNA editing differentially controlled across the T. brucei life-cycle? Objective 1 will test the ?partial-editing control? (PEC) model of exploiting partial editing to differentially inhibit mRNA maturation in two developmental forms of T. brucei. A recently developed pipeline for RNA-seq/bioinformatic analysis of edited RNAs will be employed for this purpose.

For example, the growth of root hairs with one-cell width effectively increases the surface area of the plant roots to absorb water and nutrients. Although experimental approaches have been able to track cell wall morphology and kinematics on the expanding cell wall surface for more than a century, the regulation of cell wall growth needs further elucidation. This project will develop mathematical models and computational methods to simulate the cell wall expansion due to the spatial patterning of new cell wall materials and mechanical interaction with the cell interior. Further, inference methods will be devised to predict the spatial patterning of wall-material trafficking from the cell wall geometry and quantify how volume growth inside the cell wall is distributed and rearranged to sustain the cell wall geometry during expansion and under mechanical constraints. The methods developed in this research can be applied to filamentous growth systems such as pollen tubes, root hairs, fungus hyphae, thus having significant implications in advancing agriculture and improving public health. Complementary to the research, the investigator will engage students, including K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, in research mentorship, journal clubs, and a new interactive learning platform ""Filaform?, to promote interest and transdisciplinary understanding of this biological process by leveraging geometry and other mathematics in conjunction with modern and emerging experimental techniques.<br/> <br/>To reach the research and education goals, two complementary mathematical models at different scales will be developed. The first will be a thin-shell model approximating the cell wall surface as a growing elastic boundary inflated by turgor pressure from the cell interior. Cubic-spline solutions will be developed to simulate the evolution of surface growth under the influence of turgor pressure and the distribution of exocytosis, a process that distributes new cell wall material along the cell wall interior surface. In addition, an inverse problem coupled with a subset of the model equations will be formulated to infer the distribution of exocytosis given the steady-state cell shape. Taking the exocytosis distribution as an input, the second model will be a three-dimensional model that describes the growth distribution and directionality (anisotropy) across the cell wall thickness. An energy-based material-point method will be developed to simulate the dynamics of the moving cell-wall domain. The investigator will infer the spatial map of the volume growth and anisotropy in the cell-wall domain by formulating optimization problems constrained by the three-dimensional model. Theoretical predictions from both models will be validated by experiments tracking the cell wall morphology, signals of protein complexes involved in exocytosis, and new polymers in the cell wall. The investigator will create an open-source interactive teaching and learning platform for outreach to K-12 educators and students based on the thin-shell model and its simulation. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Science and by the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These disabilities place a large burden on individuals, their families, and society as a whole. Technologies that can induce neuron restoration and rehabilitation are a critical national health priority. However, restoration or rehabilitation in the central nervous system is particularly hard to accomplish because human neurons regenerate slowly or not at all and it is difficult to deliver helpful drugs through the blood brain barrier. Meanwhile, recently developing brain surgical technologies, called focused ultrasound, possess many characteristics of an ideal neural rehabilitation technology because focused ultrasound can induce changes in brain tissue at specific places and times without harming surrounding tissues and are thought to safely open the blood-brain barrier. Development of these technologies is slowed by the inability to non-destructively measure the ultrasound pressure field inside a living subject. This makes it hard to control which ultrasound-brain tissue effect one might induce during therapy. The goal of this project is to accelerate the development of ultrasound-based neural rehabilitation technology by building devices that can non-destructively measure ultrasound pressure fields in living subjects. When completed, the device will allow doctors and researchers to measure and control the ultrasound field and, thereby, the specific ultrasound-brain interaction induced during therapy.<br/><br/>This proposal will design, prototype, and validate a novel ultrasound-encoding electromagnet that can be inserted into a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and encode acoustic longitudinal displacement fields into MR images of living subjects. The displacement data can then be used to estimate acoustic parameters such as pressure and sound speed inside the subject. If successful, the new information provided by this electromagnet insert will enhance the scientific rigor of ongoing and future ultrasound neuromodulation therapy studies. The project will be conducted in the following three phases: 1) design, 2) prototype, and 3) validation. The design phase will use simulation software to evaluate two electromagnet designs against design criteria such as the encoding capability of the electromagnet at 2 cm distance, Lorentz forces exerted on the device, and heating during operation. During the prototyping phase, the device will be constructed and evaluated against the performance criteria predicted during the design phase. The effects of the device on MRI image quality will also be assessed.

White, brown, and beige adipocytes can exist within tissues, with each type influencing tissue function in distinct ways. The research completed with this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will advance the understanding of the different types of adipocytes in diabetic skeletal muscle, and during muscle repair and regeneration.

The goal of the first objective is to determine the effects of Type 2 diabetes, adipocyte type, and adipocyte differentiation capacity on skeletal muscle properties. The tissue-engineered skeletal muscle model will be used to examine how adipocyte type and diabetes influence metabolism; the ability to change adipocyte phenotype (inducing a white to brown or beige transition) within muscle, and the role of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) in mediating these changes.  The goal of the second objective is to elucidate the role of skeletal muscle adipocytes in skeletal muscle regeneration.  The role of adipocyte type in recovery of functional outcomes in skeletal muscle will be interrogated. The use of injury will identify conditions in which adipocyte-dependent effects may be altered. The use of an engineered model where both injury and Type 2 diabetes are implemented provides an opportunity to better understand these facets as they relate to adipocytes in diabetic skeletal muscle.

While many genes in a genome have arisen by duplication, most new duplicate genes start off as redundant genetic copies. Extra copies of genes can be potentially harmful via dosage imbalances, causing health disorders and preventing new duplicate genes from evolving new functions. Gene regulatory mechanisms that can successfully compensate for such dosage effects offer a pathway for long term duplicate gene retention and functional diversification. By studying the regulatory dynamics of duplicate genes across their early evolutionary lifespan, this research aims to evaluate the role of different epigenetic factors in modulating expression and impacting gene retention and evolution after duplication. Student participation and training is central to this project, which includes data analysis by a diverse base of first-generation college students, and the transfer of coding and analytical skills to high school students from underrepresented groups in STEM. Course-based undergraduate research experiences will help generate online video tutorials on genomic and computational analysis that will become publicly available resources. These will be used in the development of workshop materials for high school educators to establish genomics curricula to help strengthen genome data literacy.<br/><br/>The regulation of a newly duplicated gene during its copy-number polymorphic phase is critical in establishing its likelihood to reach fixation and be retained over time. This project will use long-read sequencing and assembly to determine the transcriptional and epigenomic landscape of polymorphic duplicate genes among natural populations. The extent of epigenetic repression by gene age and under different selection regimes will be used to test whether epigenetic mechanisms facilitate the retention and evolution of duplicate genes before they diverge. Establishing the evolutionary dynamics of polymorphic paralogs will provide insights into the role of epigenetic modifications in regulating newly emerged genes.

Currently, the standard surgery for valve repairs is an open-heart surgery, which is only available to patients who are acceptable surgical candidates. Open-heart surgery has significant risk and recovery requirements. The proposed prototype integrates three-dimensional printing and magnetic assembly to make possible deployment of implants through thin tubes known as catheters that can place the replacement valve in the heart, addressing the need for open-heart surgery and potentially providing more effective treatment of blood back flow into the heart. This new approach will expand access to heart valve repairs, specifically the mitral valve, to patients for whom the risk of open-heart surgery is too high. The need for heart valve replacement is growing, and this new approach will further increase the market by addressing unmet needs. Three-dimensional printing can provide implants with different sizes for custom fits to individual patients, and magnetic assembly inside patients is an under-explored concept that has potential for wider surgical and interventional applications.<br/><br/>The proposed project will result in a prototype for a novel annuloplasty ring that is fabricated through three-dimensional printing and includes magnets, allowing for magnetically guided assembly within the mitral valve. The annuloplasty ring is designed for percutaneous delivery through a catheter and manipulation with catheter-based tools. Following assembly, the ring will be anchored to the annulus of the mitral valve, and an internal mechanism will be engaged to reduce the diameter of the ring, thus improving coaptation of the leaflets and treating mitral valve regurgitation. The capability for tunable diameter reduction, while the heart is beating, is a unique advantage over the standard open-heart surgery. Mechanisms for magnetic assembly and diameter reduction will be investigated by designing, fabricating, and testing structures on tissue phantoms and pig hearts. The interdisciplinary team of materials researchers, clinicians, and entrepreneurs conducting this project will choose designs that simultaneously meet requirements for manufacturing and material properties, have a compact design for delivery through catheters, and are straightforward to translate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of these individuals lose their functional abilities and face challenges even in the basic activities of daily living. Neurorehabilitation is the usual choice of treatment for such neurological illnesses, and while few people will achieve full recovery of their motor functions, slight incremental improvements in the treatment outcomes may go a long way towards boosting their future quality of life. This proposal will investigate how best to use neuromodulation techniques to improve the outcomes of neurorehabilitation, by incorporating different electrical stimulation sequences to determine optimal ways of enhancing the effects of therapeutic exercises performed during routine physical therapy sessions. The theory behind the science of neurorehabilitation and neuromodulation is that therapeutic exercises can reorganize synaptic connections of the nervous system, and electrical stimulation can be applied to enhance the effects on the central nervous system, via a mechanism known as neuroplasticity. This project seeks to address the relevance between the power distribution of electrical stimulation and signs of neuroplasticity from a signal processing perspective, confirm the curative role of neuromodulation in neurorehabilitation applications, and provide insights as to how peripheral nerve stimulation can assist axon regeneration from a power distribution perspective. The study aims to provide a transformative educational experience to college and high school students who aspire to work in the biomedical engineering profession. Students with strong interests in engineering from Chicago?s public high schools will be invited to work with undergraduate researchers who will lead specific portions of the study. The PI hopes that conducting research on improving neurorehabilitation treatment outcomes will help these students realize that their proficiency in math and science can be translated into useful tools to help society and inspire them to pursue careers in biomedical engineering. <br/><br/>This project will establish a fundamental theory of utilizing electrical modalities to enhance physical rehabilitation, in particular, the use of neuromodulation approaches to assist, support, and/or improve sensory or motor functions of persons who experience neurological ailments. The study will involve the use of an animal model to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation on the nervous system by acquiring force and electromyography from the resulting neuromuscular contractions, focusing on the relationship between power spectral density and the central and peripheral nervous systems. Unlike previous studies that evaluate the varying effects of different stimulation frequencies, this study analyzes the power spectral density of the stimulation train, i.e., the power distribution within specific frequency bands. The plan is to evaluate individually the central and peripheral effects of a stimulation train over potentiation, depression, or other forms of neuroplasticity by looking at the correlation between the power spectral densities and the elicited muscle force profiles by conducting measurements before and after a nerve block. The hypothesis underlying this study is that the electrical stimulations that correspond to certain frequency components of a power spectrum may induce higher levels of potentiation via stimulation signals sent via afferent pathways (central contributions) and/or accelerate the recovery of peripheral nerve injury by regulating ion channels of Schwann cells (peripheral contributions). Three objectives will be explored: 1) refining the apparatus design to provide concurrent acquisition of electromyography and muscle force corresponding to selected frequency bands of electrical stimulation power spectral densities; 2) comparing the electromyography and force profiles before and after applying a nerve block proximal to the peripheral nerve stimulation site to evaluate the central contribution of electrical stimulation power spectral densities; 3) applying select frequency bands of electrical stimulation power spectral densities to compare their abilities to accelerate recovery of peripheral nerve injury and to evaluate the peripheral contribution of electrical stimulation.  The results derived from these studies are intended to provide a better understanding of how electrical stimulation can be used to modulate human neuromuscular systems, design devices that can generate desired brain and peripheral nerve stimulations, and provide guidance for planning clinical trials to test such devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In most organisms, RNA is copied from DNA and directs protein synthesis without changes in the code. However, in trypanosomal mitochondria (the ?powerhouse? of cells), RNA is edited extensively by addition or removal of specific nucleotides. In their complex life cycle, trypanosomes alternate between two very different hosts: humans (and other animals) and insects, which are the vectors of tranmission. The dramatically different environments that the parasites face in humans and insects demand rapid and large-scale metabolic and physiological changes, including in RNA editing. The crucial question of how the RNA editing mechanism is precisely regulated during parasite development remains unanswered and is the focus of this research. The project will have broad educational impact by providing interdisciplinary training opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, with a focus on groups traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This project focuses on Trypanosoma brucei mRNA editing regulation and the key role of the REH2C complex that controls editing fidelity in editosomes. The research can shed new light on a question that has remained a mystery for decades: how is mRNA editing differentially controlled across the T. brucei life-cycle? Objective 1 will test the ?partial-editing control? (PEC) model of exploiting partial editing to differentially inhibit mRNA maturation in two developmental forms of T. brucei. A recently developed pipeline for RNA-seq/bioinformatic analysis of edited RNAs will be employed for this purpose. Objective 2 will address the source of substrate specificity in editing, specifically to define the role of a rare DEAH-box helicase cofactor and its individual zinc fingers in the mechanism. Objective 3 will examine dynamic interactions of editing components and remodeling by the REH2C complex by elucidating the general organization of editosomes using genetic, biochemical (proximity labeling), and chemical (crosslinking-mass spectrometry) approaches.

This will be achieved by advancing the science of magnetic components (inductors and transformers) which are the most significant bottleneck to this improved speed and size. The intellectual merits of the project include new rapid models for optimization, new component structures and designs, new applications for materials, and enabling further advancement through engineered platforms capable of studying high-power components at high speed. The broader impacts of the project include both scientific and educational components. Improved size and efficiency of power converters will enable greater proliferation of renewable energy, lighter and more affordable electric vehicles, the electrification of naval and air travel, and more affordable semiconductors. This project will also bring these scientific advances into the classroom through authentic, project-oriented courses and extracurricular activities which benefit all students and especially first-generation college students.<br/><br/>As power converters increase in switching frequency to decrease energy storage and size, the most significant barrier encountered is the energy loss in magnetic components. This barrier becomes even more significant in the megahertz (MHz) regime where the only accurate modeling methods are prohibitively slow, the few available techniques to suppress high-frequency eddy currents become unfeasible to manufacture, typical core materials become very lossy, and available characterization approaches cannot achieve good accuracy. All of these barriers stand to inhibit the design, optimization, manufacturing, and characterization of magnetic components which are required to unlock the next order-of-magnitude improvement in power conversion. This project will enable MHz operation with new accurate and rapid modeling, eddy-current suppressing designs, investigation of new materials and existing materials repurposed for power conversion, and platforms to characterize both cores and components accurately at MHz or tens of MHz.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project investigates the effectiveness of perovskite materials to serve the dual function of capturing CO2 and catalyzing its conversion to hydrocarbons by reaction with CH4.  Specifically, the aim is to tune the perovskite composition to promote efficient capture of CO2, followed by reaction with CH4, to produce syngas, ethane, and ethylene - all of value as essential platform chemicals that can be readily converted to polymers and fuels.  Thus, the project explores a novel approach to achieving the simultaneous goals of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while securing future supplies of energy and chemical raw materials. The project integrates the research with an education and outreach plan introducing students to sustainable engineering precepts, while broadening and diversifying the future science and engineering workforce.<br/><br/>The project investigates structure-composition-function properties of sorption-enhanced perovskite oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon synthesis via either dry methane reforming (DRM) or CO2-mediated oxidative coupling of methane (CO2-OCM).  Specifically, the project focuses on SrTiO3 and CaTiO3 given their inherent basicity (which promotes the adsorption of CO2), combined with their capability to activate CO2 and CH4 using oxygen vacancies.  Preliminary studies by the investigator have determined that the SrTiO3-based multifunctional catalysts, doped with Ni, can capture CO2 and convert it to syngas, ethane, and ethylene.  The project will use SrTi1-xMxO3/SrO or CaTi1-xMxO3/CaO  (with M=Ce, Mn and x = 0 ? 0.1) systems to selectivity adsorb CO2 from simulated ideal or flue gas mixtures.  Specific goals include: (1) elucidating the transport and reaction kinetics for CO2 capture and release in air and flue streams, (2) evaluating the effects of dopant metals on the kinetics, selectivity, and stability of the multifunctional catalysts under reaction conditions, and (3) enhancing the surface area of the perovskite-based catalysts by synthesizing them on monolith supports, and 4) ensuring the stability of the catalysts by investigating cyclic operation to periodically regenerate the catalysts due to metal-dopant exsolution, and/or perovskite structure destabilization under reaction conditions.  The project utilizes a broad range of characterization and evaluation techniques, highlighted by in situ and operando high-pressure/high-temperature FTIR and Raman spectroscopic characterization of adsorbed surface species (FTIR) and oxygen vacancies (Raman), the latter in collaboration with Dr. T. J. Kim at Stony Brook University.

However, turbulent flows are notoriously costly to simulate and predict due to their essentially nonlinear, chaotic behavior involving a wide range of coupled length and time scales. An increasingly attractive method is to compute only the dynamics of large-scale motions with models to represent the net effect of unresolved features, an approach known as Large-Eddy Simulation (LES). The underlying theory of LES based on spatial filtering, however, suffers from several shortcomings, including the lack of an accurate, consistent treatment of nonuniform grid resolution, boundaries, and interfaces. This proposal introduces the idea of physics-inspired coarsening as a potentially transformative concept for addressing these challenges. The main objective of the project is to develop the physics-inspired framework for turbulent flow simulations and to test it on representative flows sharing the essential characteristics with many turbulent flows of interest. As such, the proposed work aims to develop game-changing simulation technologies relevant to applications including oceanography, atmospheric science, renewable energy, aerospace, propulsion, astrophysics, and even human health. The project will include the development of a new undergraduate course in numerical methods and a fully integrated undergraduate research project to serve as on-ramps to computational science and engineering research at UC Irvine, a Hispanic Serving Institution.<br/><br/>The essential hypothesis of the physics-inspired approach is that low-cost digital representations of turbulent flows can be generated in a particularly advantageous way by leveraging physical processes that limit dynamical complexity in nature. Of foremost importance for turbulent flows, this means mimicking the physics of viscosity to develop a coarsening procedure. The physics-inspired and spatial filtering approaches are mathematically equivalent in the very simplest of cases, where spatial filtering has proven most effective. For more complex, realistic cases such as flow simulations with non-uniform grid resolution or turbulent flow modeling near a solid surface, the physics-inspired method provides a novel modeling framework that avoids the shortcomings associated with spatial filtering. The project will perform Direct Numerical Simulations together with LES to rigorously test new models in a range of flow conditions including isotropic turbulence, wall-free shear flows, and wall-bounded flows. Evaluations will include both direct testing of model accuracy prior to implementation as well as integrated testing of model performance within LES.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computers appear to be on every desk, in every backpack, and in everyone?s pocket. Smart appliances, smart watches and smart autonomous cars are no longer distant research goals; they entwine with the fabric of everyday life. Yet, compared with biology, humans' ability for manipulation of structure and dynamics at the nanoscale is found wanting. Imagine a world where one can program ""smart"" molecules ? as is done today with software ? to not only store and process information, but to also manipulate matter with nanometer precision, to sense (bio-)chemical signals from their environment, to perform robust and complex computation, and to actuate a physical response in situ. Such mastery over the physical world using molecular computers will have as profound a change on society as contemporary computers have had on the ability to store and process information electronically. This research proposes new techniques, new design principles and new architectures to program the molecular world with robust, ""field-programmable"" DNA circuits. These circuits will be reconfigurable by non-experts and without sophisticated laboratory equipment, they will be capable of exquisite detection, and they will be embeddable within paper to enable future applications that include scientific outreach and point-of-care diagnostics that can be easily distributed in low-resource settings. Integrated with the technical goals of this project is the development of summer research experiences for upper level K-12 students, and an undergraduate class in molecular computation that will broaden participation in computing by reaching across subject boundaries.<br/><br/>The project will develop new DNA strand displacement (DSD) architectures that maintain the robustness property of recent ""leakless"" systems and prioritize ease of preparation via biological production, ease of use by non-experts, and ease of reconfiguration by implementing programmable logic arrays. Robust and composable DSD modules will be developed for exponential signal amplification in vitro and in paper-based devices. These new architectures are grounded in theory and tempered by practical experimental concerns. New algorithms and software for molecular design and automation will be implemented to meet these goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High concentrations of ROS can damage biomolecules within cells, while lower levels may serve as signals for regulating the cell's machinery. The principal goal of this project is to study a novel mechanism that Phytophthora infestans may use to perceive and respond to ROS. P. infestans is a notorious plant pathogen and a member of the oomycetes, an economically important but under-studied group of microbes. Oomycetes produce a novel protein regulator of gene expression that contains the amino acid cysteine in its DNA-binding domain. ROS are hypothesized to alter the chemical form of the cysteine, altering the protein's effect on gene expression. Understanding this process may lead to new strategies for protecting crops from disease caused by oomycetes, as well as novel switches for engineering gene expression and increasing yields in industrial microbes or plants. The project will also contribute to the mentorship and training of students in STEM fields by integrating research with education and outreach in communities with high minority demographics.<br/><br/>Prior studies of bZIP transcription factors from model plants and animals identified residues in their DNA binding domains that contact the double helix, including a so-called ""invariant asparagine."" However, in about half of the bZIPs of Phytophthora infestans and other oomycetes this asparagine is replaced by cysteine. Knockdowns of the novel cysteine-containing bZIPs resulted in poor tolerance of oxidative stress, leading to the proposition that the cysteine is a redox switch affecting cellular defense networks. This will be tested by a multidisciplinary approach integrating protein biochemistry, bioinformatics, cell biology, metabolite analysis, and molecular genetics. Experiments will define the promoter motifs targeted by the bZIPs, dimerization partners of the bZIPs, and how DNA binding and dimerization are affected by cysteine oxidation. Cellular markers of the redox state will place bZIP behavior in context with what transpires during growth and development. Overall, the research will reveal how regulatory mechanisms have evolved during the eukaryotic radiation and help define pathways affecting growth and development in oomycetes<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Individuals from nearly every animal group migrate and billions of individuals, migrate thousands of kilometers each year. Considerable variation in migration route has been documented but what is less well understood is the underlying genetic basis for that variation and the consequences for maintaining species boundaries or even promoting diversification of new species. This research will make use of a global network of radio towers to collect data on migration routes in the Swainson?s thrush, a migratory bird with eastern- and western-migrating subspecies. Individuals of this species, like many others, migrate from breeding grounds in the northwestern North America via central America and south into Chile each year. This project will evaluate the underlying genetics of migration route and the consequences of routes intermediate between the classical eastern and western routes for survival and the maintenance of the subspecies. Many of the radio towers are hosted by schools. Thus, research themes and infrastructure from this project will also be used as inspiration for teaching resources for elementary, secondary, and undergraduate students across the Americas. Education modules focused on migration and evolution will be designed for teachers, provided in English and Spanish, and offered to students internationally across the migration routes of the thrush. These modules will integrate ?nature of science? pedagogy and highlight the role of under-represented groups in STEM research while featuring international coordination as key to the protection of migrating species. <br/><br/>Migration?s importance for speciation was proposed nearly three decades ago but has received far less attention. Many migrants breed next to one another but use different migratory routes. These routes are largely genetically determined and often involve navigation around large geographic barriers. Accordingly, hybrids in these systems are predicted to take intermediate routes that bring them over these barriers, reducing their fitness and gene flow between species. This project will test migration?s role in speciation. Specifically, state of the art infrastructure for tracking birds and genomic resources developed to genotype hundreds of individuals at low coverage will be used to (1) compare survival rates of parental and hybrid thrushes, (2) identify genetic variants underlying migratory traits, and (3) test if selection against hybrids is acting on these variants. No direct test of migration?s role in speciation has been conducted to date, leaving critical gaps in our understanding of speciation, given that differences in migration are taxonomically widespread and could help explain the predominance of young species pairs in the temperate region. Migration could also be a compelling example of an extrinsic postzygotic isolating barrier, given that reductions in hybrid fitness derive from mismatches between their intermediate behavior and parental environments. Extrinsic isolation is thought to be important in speciation, but its extent in nature is unknown, especially in vertebrates. This work will reach fields beyond speciation as well, including the genetics of complex behavior and conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During migration these co-occurring species may compete for food, share information or prey on one another. Although these interactions likely influence the success of migration, they remain poorly understood because researchers have almost always focused on one species at a time. Thus, prior studies have been mostly blind to the community of species that travel together. This project will address interactions among co-migrating bird species to test the notion that a wider view on animal migration is needed ? one that considers migrating animals as communities engaged in networks of interactions. Through the natural wonder of multi-species bird migrations, the project will also engage the public in science through interactions with wildlife and will provide opportunities for secondary science teachers to do authentic research.<br/><br/>This work will take advantage of recent advances in radar ecology and tracking technology, along with long-term datasets from traditional migration monitoring stations, to test theory-based predictions about community assembly processes for nocturnally migrating birds at stopovers, where access to habitat for refueling has important consequences for migration success. The project will test the hypothesis that community structure of nocturnally migrating birds at stopover site is a function of two assembly processes, filtering of migrants from passage flight and searching and settling among habitats. Drivers of the filtering process will be assessed by combining community structure metrics from long-term banding stations with radar-derived measures of migratory passage. The influence of interspecific interactions during searching and settling on movement and use of space at stopovers will be measured with fine-scale tracking of individual birds. The banding and tracking data will also be used to address the influence of community assembly processes on refueling rates and stopover duration, costs that could scale-up to shape migratory routes, phenology, and success. Consistent with calls for the scientific community to expand engagement with science in ways that support dialogue, shift beliefs, and build trust and relationships, this project will bring together science education professionals to conduct an applied evaluative study of public engagement at bird banding stations. The team will also collaborate with secondary science teachers to develop distance learning lessons that address questions about bird migration and climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This enables the compartmentalization of metabolic processes and protects fungal cells from external stressors, including commercial fungicides that are used extensively to control unwanted fungal growth. Antifungal proteins produced by different species of fungi can attack the cell wall and membrane causing injury and the death of susceptible fungal cells. These antifungals have been cited as potentially being useful to control the growth of undesirable fungi. This research will explore the fundamental cellular mechanisms that are employed by fungi to resist intoxication by antifungal proteins. Specifically, the project will test how mutations in genes used for cell wall and membrane construction and stability result in resistance to antifungal proteins. Antifungal proteins are produced by a significant proportion of fungi, especially by yeasts that are associated with insects, fruits, and fermentation (e.g. brewing and baking). The general familiarity of the public with yeasts will enable schoolchildren and patrons of the local farmer?s market to participate in the isolation of yeasts that produce novel antifungal proteins. These outreach activities will be enhanced by the participation of undergraduate research students to enable the identification of novel antifungal proteins and their application to further investigate the function and organization of the fungal membrane and cell wall. Students from the University of Idaho will also be included in research activities. The central goal of this approach is to increase retention of university students, enrollment in higher education of postsecondary and postbaccalaureate students, and to improve public STEM education.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to discover the cellular mechanisms that are important for fungal resistance to antifungal ?killer? toxins.

These hypotheses were formulated based on preliminary data that has identified mutations in the RAM network that result in killer toxin resistance and the loss of membrane and cell wall integrity. To test these hypotheses, it will be determined how mutations in the RAM network that cause killer toxin resistance alter the networks organization, localization, and function relating to cytokinesis and cell polarity. Specifically, the effect of these mutations on the localization of the killer toxin membrane receptor (Kre1p) will be tested. This approach will be complemented by an in-depth study of the effect of Kre1p diversity on killer toxin resistance and the immunity mechanisms of killer yeasts that prevent self-intoxication. The outcome of this research will be to confirm the novel role of the RAM network in cell surface organization.

Buoyant material, such as floating debris, marine organisms, oil and microplastics may be aggregated and trapped within estuaries or dispersed and discharged to the coastal ocean by these transport processes. Strong convergent surface flows across the estuary organize buoyant material into laterally narrow near-surface patches that may extend up to a few kilometers along the estuary. Local currents that move these patches may substantially differ from tidally and laterally averaged currents, which are often used to estimate estuarine transport characteristics. A major objective of this project is to contrast the transport of material in a frame work that follows the flow, known as the Lagrangian framework, with one based on a fixed point reference frame, or the Eulerian framework.  Often the Lagrangian trajectories of material differ from those inferred from the Eulerian mean flows. The classic example stems from surface waves where the average velocity at a point (Eulerian) will be zero but a particle oscillating with the wave included flow will have an average velocity in the direction of wave propagation, due to the Stokes drift or Stokes velocity.  This project will investigate the importance of Stokes transport in estuaries. The project research hypotheses are: (1) Stokes transport associated with amplitude and phase structure of tidal flows contribute significantly to the transport of buoyant material in both the along-channel and cross- channel directions. (2) Buoyant material organizes in surface patches due to the lateral estuarine circulations. (3) Patches of buoyant material are fundamentally transported by spatiotemporally localized currents that vary substantially across the estuary. (4) The observed spatiotemporal distributions of marine debris in Delaware Bay are a characteristic signature of Lagrangian estuarine transport. The project will use both modeling and observations to address transport of buoyant material in estuaries. This research will help solve practical real world problems related to marine pollution, gas exchange and fisheries. The PIs have close working relationships with resource managers and policy makers with whom they will communicate relevant new understanding. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students, and both PIs and students will participate in public outreach events. <br/> <br/>This project will examine transport of buoyant material in estuaries, specifically the Delaware Estuary, including its aggregation within estuaries, and the effects of resulting patchiness of buoyant material on its transport through the estuary. The hypotheses will be addressed through an integrated research program that employs original concept models as well as observations and simulations. Research objectives include: (1) Assess and advance idealized linear and weakly-nonlinear models of the three-dimensional estuarine circulations to determine key factors that control secondary circulations, such as bathymetry, tides, Coriolis force, and baroclinicity. (2) Develop and evaluate a Lagrangian framework for the estuarine circulation based on the integration of the idealized models with existing field observations and an asymptotic Stokes drift analysis to contrast fundamental differences between the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. (3) Conduct and integrate hydrodynamic simulations and field observations of the Delaware Estuary to understand tidal neap-spring and high-low river discharge variability. (4) Apply the Lagrangian framework to simulation and observation results, as well as recent marine debris observations, to reveal principal Lagrangian transport characteristics and improved estuarine transport estimates. By exploring and developing a Lagrangian framework this project would fundamentally advance our understanding of the physics of estuarine transport processes. This work will transform the current paradigm of estuarine material transport to include new lateral transport processes, thereby advancing the current conceptual understanding of buoyant tracer dynamics in an estuary, and will contribute to solving practical real world problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work will occur at five different levels of biological organization: global hormone levels, metabolic enzyme levels for converting hormones at the cellular level, hormone receptor levels at the cellular level, the distribution of genomic binding sites for receptors, and the transcriptional response. Two genera of fishes will be used that include evolutionary transitions of phenotype from males to females or vice-versa. Using the evolutionary history of the traits for predictive power, the research will test whether the biological control mechanisms use different pathways based on the ancestral condition of the phenotype. The prediction is that novel traits will use existing mating-type biased pathways while evolutionarily transitioned traits will modify pathways that are typically present in the opposite mating-type.

Streaming-algorithms research tackles this challenge head on and aims to come up with novel algorithms that manage to extract some global features of the data despite the limited time and memory. While many surprising tasks are by now known to be solved by streaming algorithms, and others are known to require large memory, this area still lacks broad understanding. This project aims for a systematic study of the power of streaming algorithms in the context of constraint-satisfaction problems (CSPs). CSPs are a broad, natural class of optimization problems that have been intensely explored in the context of fast algorithms without memory constraints. In that context they have served as a valuable tool in understanding the diversity of algorithms, inherent limits on algorithmic performance, and in understanding which algorithm to use for a newly discovered task. This project aims for a similar understanding of the power of streaming algorithms when memory is limited. Success in such a project would vastly improve understanding of the power, the limits, and the variety that exists among algorithms that analyze massive streams of data with limited computational resources. Such an understanding would yield a readily applicable toolkit for an application designer aiming to design a streaming algorithm for a newly encountered task, thereby vastly improving the bridge from the theory to its application. <br/><br/>Technically this project aims for a complete classification of all constraint-satisfaction problems in the setting of streaming algorithms. Constraint-satisfaction problems form an infinite class of optimization problems where the goal is to find an assignment to n variables that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, where a single constraint depends on a constant number of variables and restricts the joint assignment of these variables. The sets of restricted assignments defines the problem. The goal of the classification is to determine the exact approximability of the optimum for every constraint-satisfaction problem, when restricted to subpolynomial space in n, and to sublinear space in n. Additional goals involve understanding the limits of multipass algorithms. Some concrete algorithms that the project explores are ""sketching algorithms,"" ""snapshot algorithms,"" and ""random-walk algorithms"". The former two are known to exhibit surprising power. The latter classes of algorithms are broader but have not been shown to be more powerful. The ultimate goal of this project is to resolve the strength of these algorithms. On the lower-bound side, the project will explore new questions and models in communication complexity and new tools in information theory with the aim of proving limits to these algorithms. The educational component of the project involves developing courses in information theory, and including modules related to streaming algorithms in the undergraduate curriculum. Progress from the project will be reported on public domain sites like the arxiv (www.arxiv.org).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the synthesis of atomically thin insulators with controllable atomic structures and electrical properties is a significant challenge.  This research projects seeks to develop a unique process to prepare atomically thin carbon-based insulators from solution-processable precursors.  Their atomic structures can be adjusted to optimize their properties for different demanding applications in electronics.  The thickness of the prepared insulating thin films can be precisely controlled down to atomic resolution, and they can be formed with excellent uniformity across the whole surface of semiconductor wafers.  Results from this project shed light on the structure-property relationship for atomically thin solids that lacks an ordered internal structure, and could technologically lead to faster, more powerful, and more portable cell phones and computers.  The project provides summer research internships for local high-school students from underrepresented groups and helps to develop a hands-on module with focus on the application of machine learning in material characterizations for undergraduates.  These outreach opportunities prepare sustainable, adaptable, and globally competitive science and engineering workforce to benefit US economy.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The objective of this project is to develop two-dimensional (2D) amorphous carbon with unique atomic structures and material properties as a novel and transformative dielectric material for advanced electronic applications.  The project starts from developing a unique process to prepare 2D amorphous carbon monolayer with tunable degree of medium range ordering, based on the tiling and cross-linking of zero-dimensional carbon dots with intrinsic crystalline-amorphous core-shell structure as solution-processable precursors.  Layer-by-layer deposition further enables the precise control over the film thickness at atomic resolution.  Scientifically, the unique properties of the atomically thin 2D amorphous carbon will be correlated with the detailed atomic structures combining material characterizations, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and density-functional theory simulation.

In many real-world scenarios, however, the data is privacy-sensitive, as is the case for healthcare records, financial transactions, or geolocation data. Privacy-preserving machine-learning techniques can facilitate machine-learning applications while protecting the privacy of sensitive data. This project aims to develop an efficient, secure, and trustworthy collaborative learning paradigm to address several critical challenges in the real-world application of privacy-preserving collaborative learning. The outcomes of the project will allow multiple data owners to collaborate to train machine-learning models without revealing any sensitive data, which will improve the performance of machine-learning applications by increasing the volume and diversity of data. It will also facilitate novel applications in fields where data is scarce and collaboration has traditionally been limited due to privacy challenges, such as better drug and vaccine discovery in healthcare. The research will be strongly integrated with education, through mentoring of undergraduate students, development of new undergraduate and graduate courses, and machine-learning workshops for K-12 students and teachers, with the goal of building a diverse and inclusive machine learning workforce. <br/><br/>Privacy-preserving machine learning is expected to revolutionize the future of data-driven collaborative applications, by allowing large-scale machine-learning applications without revealing any sensitive data, but its real-world adoption has been limited by several major barriers, including the communication bottleneck, security, and trustworthiness. The research will address these fundamental challenges by introducing a new approach rooted in information and coding theory. The research is organized in three main thrusts: 1) develop the foundations of communication-efficient privacy-preserving collaborative learning; 2) realize a privacy-preserving machine-learning paradigm with provable security and fairness guarantees; and 3) enable privacy-preserving machine learning in arbitrary network topologies, including centralized, decentralized, and dynamic topologies, and networks with heterogeneous computing and communication resources. The research is rooted in coding and information theory, and incorporates stochastic optimization, distributed computing, and cryptography. The insights gained from the research will enable privacy-aware machine learning applications that are: 1) accessible by users with bandwidth and computational limitations, such as consumer devices in mobile edge networks; 2) secure, by preventing adversaries from injecting unwanted behavior into the decision process; and 3) fair in its decisions towards all communities in society, without revealing any sensitive data and personal information.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In aid of improving societal understanding and perceptions of the federal judiciary, this project will develop, make public, and use the Federal Judicial Database. When complete, these data will include detailed background information on all federal district and circuit judges serving from 1789 to the present selected to their positions through presidential nomination and Senate confirmation. The data will be presented to the public through an interactive website designed to facilitate broad user accessibility.<br/><br/>The Federal Judicial Database will provide detailed biographical, attribute, and background data on the thousands of federal district and circuit judges selected into their positions under Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Compiled from federal judges? nomination documentation presented to the Senate, along with other congressional, judicial, and biographical sources and updates of prior data collection efforts, the Federal Judicial Database will include extensive data on each federal judge, including information on nomination, confirmation, departure, demographics, biography, prior judicial and legal employment, and pre-appointment writings and speeches. The Investigator will design, develop, and produce a public website for the consumption and distribution of the Federal Judicial Database. The website design will accommodate information about the research project and data (project background, codebooks, data sources, citations, and publications), interactive search and display abilities, and access to pre-prepared datasets for download. The public web interface will be designed to make the data attractive and accessible to a broad set of non-scholar users and will highlight both individual judge profiles and cross-judge profiles based on interactive searches conducted by the user. Using the newly collected Federal Judicial Database, the Investigator will undertake two research applications. The first of these is an examination of whether district court judges with different legal backgrounds manage civil cases in distinct ways (such as in holding settlement conferences) and whether they vary in their successful encouragement of case settlements. Relevant judge factors from the Federal Judicial Database will include, for example, a district judge?s prior experience as a civil litigator, arbitrator, or mediator and the number of cases she took to trial during her legal career. The second research project using the Federal Judicial Database will be a study of how much variation exists in federal courts of appeals judge professional backgrounds (for example, prior service as prosecutors, public defenders, and corporate lawyers) across time and whether these different judicial backgrounds affect decision making on the federal bench. Beyond these two research projects, the Federal Judicial Database will permit rigorous inquiry into the patterns and effects of judges? writing, trial experience, education and training, group membership, and more.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They will establish new services and applications in fields such as ocean sciences, robotics, autonomous driving, indoor localization, and crowd counting. Existing methods rely on simplifications and preprocessing stages that reduce the data rate of the measurements, but also discard relevant information and thus limit performance. In particular, if objects are close to each other or the measurements they generate are weak, existing methods are often unable to perceive them reliably. This project aims to establish new perception methods that make optimal use of all the available information to provide unprecedented performance in challenging scenarios. The key principle that will enable the use of a large number of sensors with high data rates, is to systematically exploit graph structures in the mathematical formulation of perception problems. The developed methods will be evaluated using underwater acoustic data provided by vector sensors and large arrays of hydrophones. Innovation resulting from this project will substantially improve the performance of marine perception systems but also lead to tangible advances in a variety of further applications including autonomous driving, medical imaging, and wireless communication. Interdisciplinary education and outreach activities aim to expose a diverse cohort of students to state-of-the-art machine learning and perception techniques as well as their deployment at sea. Research results will be disseminated to the scientific community and used in teaching materials as well as tutorials and short courses to be presented worldwide.<br/><br/>This project will introduce graph-based estimation to establish perception methods that make use of all the available information and thus yield unprecedented perception performance. The principle of ""stretching"" or ""opening"" graph nodes will be employed to replace high-dimensional operations by lower-dimensional ones. Based on this principle, iterative perception methods with convergence guarantees as well as strongly reduced computational complexity and superior scalability will be developed. Contrary to conventional object perception approaches, the high scalability of the envisaged methods makes it possible to generate and maintain a very large number of object hypotheses and, in turn, improve perception performance. Of particular interest are methods where a new object hypothesis is formed for each real- or complex-valued data cell (sample, pixel, or bin), and each data cell is probabilistically associated with an object hypothesis in a holistic graph-based framework. In addition, the research team will introduce graph-based estimation methods that embed simulators of the physical environment to exploit multipath propagation and virtual apertures with the goal of improving the perception of low-observable objects and providing robustness against uncertain environmental parameters. The project will also devise an extension of graph-based machine perception methods that adaptively refines the underlying statistical model by information learned from data. Here, the graph that describes the original statistical model of the perception problem is supported by a graph neural network trained with labeled real data or with synthesized data provided by simulators of the physical environment. Finally, an open software and hardware platform for the demonstration of perception capabilities will bring together research and education as well as support comprehensive outreach and dissemination activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mobility is a hallmark of human health, yet mobility limitations continue to reduce personal independence and overall quality of life in nearly a third of Americans. Musculoskeletal conditions alone cost the United States? economy 5% of its overall gross domestic product. Traditionally, mobility has been studied in gait laboratories, with expensive equipment, trained personnel, and time-consuming data processing pipelines, limiting studies in size, setting, and monitoring time. Recent advances in computer vision and wearable sensing could bring motion tracking with smartphones and wearable sensors to laboratories, clinics, and patient homes at negligible costs, growing studies from tens to thousands of subjects. Current approaches for motion tracking from videos and wearables, however, remain insufficiently accurate for research and clinical translation. One of the challenges is that they are primarily data-driven, relying on limited training data that do not include patients with mobility limitations. This project will merge the complementary strengths of artificial intelligence (AI) and physics-based modeling into a new motion-tracking paradigm that is widely accessible, dynamically robust, and equitably accurate across human demographics and abilities. <br/><br/>The technical objectives of this project are to (1) create and evaluate a new computational framework for musculoskeletal modeling with wearable sensors and smartphone videos, and (2) use this framework to answer fundamental questions about the role of cyclic loading on cartilage health. This work will empower biomechanical engineers and rehabilitation specialists by fundamentally changing the amount and type of data they use to answer scientific questions around mobility limitations. The technical contributions will integrate multibody dynamics with state-of-the-art machine learning models to enable accurate motion tracking from wearable sensors and smartphone cameras. Additionally, subject-specific anatomy from medical images will be incorporated into these modeling frameworks to enable the estimation of internal biomechanics. The scientific contributions will advance the field of orthopaedic rehabilitation by generating previously unavailable knowledge on how subject-specific joint mechanics modulate cartilage response to cyclic loading in natural environments, which will be critical in the design of personalized rehabilitation technologies for osteoarthritis prevention.

In this wide range of applications, there are feedback loops between learning algorithms and people that impact the quality of the learning process and the wellbeing of people.

The core computation of linear algebra is matrix multiplication. In 1968 V. Strassen discovered that the widely used and assumed best algorithm for matrix multiplication is not optimal. Since then there has been intense research in both determining just how efficiently matrices may be multiplied and determining the limits of how much Strassen's  algorithm  can be improved. This project will address both efficiency and limits. Both parts will be approached using theoretical mathematics not traditionally utilized in the study of these questions, namely representation theory and algebraic geometry. The novel use of modern mathematical techniques will enrich both theoretical computer science and pure mathematics, as they will open  new questions in mathematics and provide new techniques to computer science.<br/><br/>The exponent of matrix multiplication, denoted omega, is the fundamental constant that governs the complexity of matrix multiplication and all basic operations in linear algebra. It is currently known that omega is somewhere between 2 and 2.38.  After Strassen's 1968 discovery, which led to the definition of the exponent and proof that it is at most 2.81, over the next twenty years it was steadily lowered to 2.38. In the past 33 years,  it has been improved by less than .004. All improvements since 1987 have been made indirectly through the use of auxiliary tensors and in the past 10 years explanations for why progress became incremental  have emerged: the utility of auxiliary tensors currently being used is limited. The upper bound part of this project will discover (using geometric methods) and utilize new auxiliary tensors that are not subject to such utility limits. The lower bound part of the project will bound border rank of tensors. There are no nontrivial lower bounds on the exponent, and in order to prove one, one would have to prove a super-linear lower bound on the border rank of some tensor, a goal that is out of reach with current technology. The current technology can barely prove border rank bounds of 2N for (N,N,N)-tensors. This project will significantly improve lower bound technology by introducing further new tools to the area from modern algebraic geometry such as deformation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The intellectual merits of the project include developing novel optimization, graph theory, low-rank matrix theory, and machine learning-based methods for optimal planning and operation of moving target defense devices, rapid detection, accurate identification, and robust mitigation of cyber data integrity attacks. The broader impacts of the project include promoting public awareness and understanding of smart grid cybersecurity, contributing to power engineering education, and preparing a diverse learning community, including middle and high school students, with requisite knowledge and skillsets to tackle future power grid security challenges. The successful completion of this project will provide power system operators with new tools to enhance situational awareness and better defend the power grid against cyber data attacks.<br/><br/>MTD is an emerging concept originally introduced for computer and communication networks. Existing MTD approaches are limited to the cyber layer of a cyber-physical system.

The goal of this CAREER project is to develop and validate physical-layer MTD approaches to detect, identify, and mitigate data integrity attacks by strong adversaries with state-of-the-art machine learning capabilities. The proposed MTD approaches feature three major technical innovations: 1) A minimum spanning tree-enabled planning scheme that maximizes MTD detection effectiveness while considering system economic and reliability metrics; 2) A novel alternating current optimal power flow operational framework, constrained by scalable voltage stability approaches, to ensure the MTD hiddenness and detection performance; and 3) A low-rank matrix decomposition method assisted by MTD approaches that radically improves the attack identification speed and measurement recovery accuracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This question cannot be answered by studying spoken languages, whose origins extend back into prehistory. However, sign languages continue to be created in the present day wherever a critical mass of deaf individuals forms. Thus, newly emerging sign languages provide researchers the opportunity to observe the process of language creation directly. This research project focuses on one such sign language, created by three deaf siblings and four of their hearing family members. This homesign language began as an idiosyncratic gesture system developed by the first deaf individual born into the family and was later elaborated into a shared sign system by later-born deaf and hearing family members. This research project sets out to document the grammatical structure of the language, focusing on the ways in the which the sign system of the first-born deaf individual differs from those of the later-born signers. This approach has the potential to shed light on how grammatical structure emerges and develops at the earliest stages of language creation.<br/><br/>This research project focuses on two grammatical structures that have been documented in nearly all sign languages studied to date: (i) classifier constructions and (ii) directional verbs. Classifier constructions represent the motion and location of objects in space and involve a meaningful handshape unit that identifies the category of the object. The inventory of classifier handshapes is unique to each signed language. This project uses existing sign language assessment tools to determine whether the signers have developed conventions for the use of classifier handshapes. Like classifier constructions, directional verbs also make use of space. However, rather than marking locative relations, directional verbs use space to represent the grammatical relations of subject and object?who does what to whom. In other emerging sign languages, directional verbs have been shown to develop gradually as the language is passed down from generation to generation. This research project asks whether the transmission of the language among members of the family has supported the emergence of directional verbs. Classifier constructions and directional verbs have been argued to represent the interface of grammatical structure with non-linguistic gesture. To determine the contribution of gesture to the emergent structure of the language, this research project also examines the gestures produced by hearing, non-signing individuals from the larger community. Altogether, this project aims to tease apart the contributions of a variety of factors to the process of language emergence, including: an individual's capacity to create language, transmission of a sign system from individual to individual, and the role of the gestural practices of the ambient speech community. This research contributes to our understanding of the human language capacity and raises awareness about sign languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adsorption involves the concentration or rejection of molecules interacting with a material surface. It is a ubiquitous phenomenon present in our everyday lives and in many industrial and biological settings. Important technological applications that depend on adsorption processes include drug delivery, power production and energy storage, water harvesting, and others that affect the overall societal well-being of humanity. This research project makes use of powerful computational modeling tools to uncover a comprehensive picture of the interactions between the gas species and materials onto which they adsorb. This research will lead to fundamental insights into the adsorption process and the identification of promising new adsorbents that are crucial for technological advancements in areas of national importance including health care, climate change, and water scarcity. Integrated outreach and education components within this project include increasing literacy of machine learning at the undergraduate and graduate levels through course design; hosting middle school teachers through the Notre Dame Senior STEM Teaching Fellows Residency program to create course materials for 6-8th graders centered on probability and statistics; and translation of the middle school course material into Spanish for dissemination to Hispanic communities to improve their representation in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This research program will integrate advanced molecular modeling and machine learning methods to create a universal gas adsorption model. By specifying the absorbent material, an adsorbate gas species, and the adsorption conditions (temperature and pressure), the model will be able to accurately predict the amount of gas that is adsorbed within the material pores at equilibrium. An adsorption model with such predictive capabilities would constitute an important engineering design tool, eliminating the current bottleneck posed by the high computational cost of screening all potential materials with molecular simulations and fundamentally advancing drug delivery, power production and energy storage (e.g., hydrogen), and atmospheric water harvesting and carbon capture technologies. The development of models to predict the nature of gas physisorption in porous materials will be developed within an active learning (AL) framework to efficiently navigate the large chemical spaces of adsorbates and adsorbents. The properties of absorbent materials and gas molecules will be represented as ?features? alchemically to maximize the range of materials and molecules that can be studied in a computationally feasible manner. The AL algorithm will inform, in an automated fashion, which simulations to perform to achieve accurate predictions with a limited number of simulations, thus allowing for an exhaustive yet efficient exploration of the feature space. The research plan is based on three objectives: (1) implement and validate an active learning framework capable of navigating adsorption landscapes, (2) navigate the feature landscapes of simple gas adsorbates, and (3) simultaneously navigate the feature landscapes of molecules and porous materials for gas adsorption. Because the proposed AL framework will be readily adaptable to other adsorption/material design scenarios, phase equilibrium studies beyond gas adsorption will benefit. These research efforts will be complemented by outreach efforts to middle schools and the public through bilingual curriculum development and middle school teacher training in probability and statistics, and dissemination of the course materials in Spanish to the local Hispanic community and in Puerto Rico.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to contribute in this direction by tackling two pressing challenges that limit the broader applicability of machine learning: (i) solving more complex tasks with multiple actions and decisions over time and (ii) learning from corrupted data. The goal is to study the performance and potential shortcomings of existing approaches through a unified framework and develop novel algorithms that are provably robust and efficient.

Moreover, many networks, including this underlying critical infrastructure such as communication, power, and transportation networks, are highly interdependent. While there exists considerable research on the modeling and analysis of isolated networks, the study of interdependent and multilayer networks, particularly in the presence of strategic and self-interested decision makers, confronts many open challenges. This proposal will leverage tools from optimization, game theory, machine learning, and graph theory towards building an analytical framework for the study of multilayer networks. The findings will have impact on the design and operation of self-organizing multi-agent systems in complex network environments, as well as in securing interdependent critical infrastructure. Integrated with the proposed research, the education plan will broaden participation in the proposed research areas and provide audiences at all levels with applied and hands-on experiences through collaboration with outreach programs at the Ohio State University. <br/><br/>At the core of this proposal is the study of multilayer networks using game-theoretic modeling and analysis. This project will propose and analyze a new class of multi-network games for the study of decentralized decision-making and learning over interconnected networks. This framework will account for the multi-modality of information and communication channels available to entities in multi-agent systems and identify the potential sources of inefficiency in decentralized decision making in multilayer network environments (as compared to both centrally operated and single layer networks). It will also propose and evaluate the impact of incentives or interventions to shape the outcomes of decentralized decision making and distributed learning on these networks, through mechanism design and targeted interventions. These findings will be used to show how the holistic study of multilayer networks, as opposed to focusing on each network individually, enhances our ability to design and evaluate economic and regulatory interventions, and prevent unwanted equilibria or learning outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When driven through porous materials, viscoelastic fluids exhibit an abrupt transition to chaotic flow, which is a key feature of enhanced mixing that regulates a vast array of important geological, biological, and industrial processes. Despite our deep understanding of viscoelastic flows in simple model geometries, predicting their flow properties through the intricate, irregular crevices of porous materials remains an outstanding challenge. The goal of this work is to quantify viscoelastic fluid flows in a range of model and realistic porous media and determine how microscopic geometry affects the macroscopic flow and transport properties of viscoelastic fluids. The outcomes of this project will have direct implications for extraction and bioremediation efficiency in rock and soil, minimizing power consumption and cost in polymer processing, and understanding biofilm mechanics that affect soil ecology and infections in humans. Under this project, workshops will be organized to promote early career development of scientists in the field, several undergraduate and graduate students will receive research training, and aspects of this work will be integrated into microfluidics and complex fluids courses.<br/><br/><br/>The stability of viscoelastic fluid flows through porous media strongly depends upon the disorder and connectivity of successive pores. The memory of elastic stresses couples advection to pore microstructure making for exquisitely complex stability criteria, and emphasizing the need to consider the Lagrangian character of polymeric flows. A dearth of quantitative studies across relevant two- and three-dimensional flow geometries has yielded often conflicting outcomes and has inhibited our ability to forecast the dispersive transport properties of these systems. To resolve these key deficiencies in our current understanding of viscoelastic flows through porous media, the following principle aims will be achieved through the integration of microfluidic experiments and numerical simulations: (1) Determine the role of geometrical structure, disorder, and porosity on viscoelastic instability in two-dimensional porous media flows. (2) Establish the effect of geometry and viscoelasticity on dispersion in porous media through analysis of Lagrangian coherent structures. (3) Elucidate the role of three-dimensionality in the viscoelastic stability and resultant transport properties of porous media flows.

In non-agricultural settings, such as hilly and mountainous terrain that dominates the western United States, accurate data showing how soil organic carbon is distributed and changes following wildfire is lacking. This project will collect data on the extent, depth, and age of soil organic carbon at recently-burned mountainous study sites in southwest Oregon, and it will examine the factors that affect soil organic carbon changes in such landscapes. This research will help to inform soil management schemes, including efforts to sequester carbon in soils to combat climate change. The project team will also actively contribute to experiential learning initiatives at the University of Oregon, which seek to empower students from historically underrepresented groups toward pursuing interests in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and it will support training for a female graduate student.<br/><br/>This project will quantify the functional relationships between topography, soil properties, and soil organic carbon, which can be applied to an array of eroding, soil-mantled landscapes across the world. Through the coupling of geomorphic theory for soil production and transport, high-resolution topography generated from airborne lidar, and field-derived ecological and biogeochemical data, this project will track changes in soil organic carbon pools on hillslopes that span a range of erosion rates and morphologic characteristics. In addition, using data from study sites in southwest Oregon, this project will determine how disturbance and forest succession affect soil organic carbon amounts and permanence, assessed through the quantification of carbon stocks combined with radiometric dating, and thus determine the legacy of past and future wildfires. The project's integrative framework can be calibrated and applied in different ecoregions to map soil carbon in a fashion that allows for rapid and accurate upscaling. This project will advance the potential of critical zone science to improve carbon cycling predictions under global environmental change. Improved understanding of soil organic carbon will contribute to practical applications in land management and global climate model development.

There is a rising need to characterize soot formation in extremely hot flames due to prominence of kerosene-fueled rockets, oxy-fuel combustion systems and other emerging combustion processes. The scientific objective is to shed light on soot formation in flames hotter than traditionally studied. A complementary experimental and computational modeling approach will be used to isolate fundamental phenomena unique to this soot formation regime. Imminent space cargo and tourism enterprises require soot models for rocket thruster design and particulate emissions predictions. Nanocrystalline carbon forms during rocket flight powered by kerosene and other hydrocarbon propellants. A more thorough consideration of performance and unknown environmental impacts (i.e. public health, climate, etc.) is facilitated by studying soot formation at elevated temperature. High temperature oxyfuel combustion, preheated air systems and enriched air processing are also examples of emerging combustion technologies operating hotter than conventional combustion. In terms of societal impact, the urgent need for more inclusive participation in graduate school and academic careers will be enhanced through collaboration with the McNair program and Bridges Community College program. Virtual teaching modules for thermofluids theory and applications will also be developed to increase participation of local high-school students.<br/><br/>Quantification of competing soot formation processes remains a challenge. Fuel-rich flame chemistry models leading to gas-phase soot precursors vary widely for conventional combustion temperatures and no studies for elevated temperature flames exist. The same can be said for the underlying aerosol dynamics and evolution in soot nanostructure. The central hypothesis is that quantification of reversible soot precursor reactions, reduction in collision efficiency, extreme particle graphitization and, perhaps, ionization processes are required to accurately capture soot behavior at elevated temperatures. At the conclusion of the proposed activities the PI will have: (i) systematically measured individual PAH profiles and soot particle size distributions in well-characterized laminar and turbulent laboratory flames; (ii) characterized evolution in carbon nanostructure and morphology for particles formed in elevated temperature flames; (iii) assessed the role of ionization processes on soot formation in this regime; (iv) incorporated new experimental observations into new models for higher temperature soot formation; (v) demonstrated unique higher-temperature processes governing the transition from soot to newly discovered nanocrystalline carbon structure. The proposed project is significant because self-consistent development of soot formation theory will be facilitated by the comprehensive experimental and modeling approach for the benefit of conventional and higher-temperature regimes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using a combination of advanced nanomaterial synthesis and nanoscale thermal characterization, this project seeks to reveal important length scales of magnetic heat conduction.

Young children intuitively shape playdough, unaware that they are controlling shear-forces when deciding to tear or pinch the material, where the direction of applied force defines their effects. However, the outcomes of applied mechanical forces become much less intuitive if we zoom into biomolecules. In fact, chemistry at shear forces is quite intriguing, with relatively soft bonds becoming very strong depending on how force is applied to them. Such intriguing behavior is crucial for the inner workings of all cells, where proteins are often under the influence of mechanical forces. Frequently, the directionality and amplitude of these forces can regulate biological activities. In this project, the researchers are not only investigating the intriguing behavior of proteins that are mechanoactive, that is, that react differently depending on the forces applied on them, but also developing computational tools that make it possible to study them with atomic detail. Particularly, mechanoactive proteins that are found in the surface of both good and bad bacteria will be investigated to elucidate how they become extremally resilient to shear forces and allow infections to take place within our bodies. Additionally, new immersive technologies will be developed to observe these proteins under shear-force load, powering the ?Immersive Biophysics on the Road? program, where tools and knowledge developed in this project will tour Alabama to showcase STEM. An inflatable projection dome will then be used to teach the molecular mechanisms of life. <br/><br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to characterize, with atomic and sub-atomic resolution, the protein:protein interactions responsible for the remarkable mechanostability of extracellular protein complexes. The central hypothesis of this project is that evolution has created geometrical artifices that are used by different proteins to become stronger when under mechanical stress, and also modular and flexible when needed. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work that has shown a simple geometric mechanism responsible for mechanostability, but that is challenging to be achieved at the molecular level. Here, the rationale is that understanding the molecular details at play will allow for the manipulation of mechanostability; for guiding the development of molecules that can inhibit adhesion processes; and for proposing the development of biotechnology tools that could profit from the mechanostability of these proteins. These goals will be achieved by: 1. developing bioinformatic tools to resurrect cellulosomal proteins ancestors to understand how mechanostability evolved; 2. Investigating the mechanism by which staph bacteria form highly-stable bonds to the human extra-cellular matrix. Particularly, this project will employ a combination of classical molecular dynamics, hybrid quantum/classical calculations, and dimensionality reduction methods, in order to characterize sub-atomic properties of proteins under mechanical stress. Additionally, new molecular dynamics methods for analysis and visualization will be made easier by implementing them into graphical user interfaces. Most of the new implementations will be made into QwikMD, which will incorporate new methods for structure prediction based on artificial intelligence, as well as new immersive visualization renderings, which will allow for the use of portable planetarium-like domes and virtual reality headsets for science outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in many natural phenomena and technological processes, phase transitions occur very rapidly. An important example is cavitation, which is the formation of bubbles due to low or even negative pressures in liquids. Cavitation starts with the nucleation and rapid growth of bubbles.  The process is difficult to characterize in three-dimensional samples because it can occur anywhere and is completed in nanoseconds. Classical nucleation theory (CNT) helps understand the dynamics of nucleation, but there are important cases where it fails, such as cavitation in pure water near room temperature, which occurs at very different pressures than those predicted by CNT. Refining theoretical models requires accurate experimental data.  Furthermore, data under extreme conditions is important for addressing cavitation in applications such as modern diesel engines, which use high pressure fuel injection to achieve high efficiency and low emissions. This project will apply and refine laser ablation techniques to induce cavitation at large negative pressures on nanosecond time scales, and ultrafast flashes of light and X-rays to capture the evolution of cavitation bubbles over nanoseconds and at nanometer dimensions. Advanced image analysis and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations will be used to increase the accuracy of pressure measurements at the inception of cavitation.  The work will be performed in university labs and at X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facilities and will involve a collaboration on CFD simulations with Prof. Dr. Nikolaus Adams at the Technical University of Munich. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students and will expose them to university research and also to large science facilities and international collaborations.<br/><br/>The project will investigate cavitation in water and diesel fuel below the boiling point (cold cavitation) at time and length scales that represent the experimental frontier of the field (nanosecond and nanometer, or ?ultrafast?), using pulsed X-ray laser ablation and pulsed optical ablation. The techniques to induce cavitation at the nanosecond-nanometer scales have been recently demonstrated, but they must be refined, and high accuracy measurements of cavitation pressures and nucleation rates are not yet possible. Therefore, new techniques will be developed to characterize the dynamics of ultrafast cavitation: (1) extracting directly from high-accuracy optical images of drops and jets detailed hydrodynamic parameters, such as pressure wave kinematics and amplitude, using advanced image analysis in combination with image simulations; (2) combining high-accuracy image data with high-accuracy computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to measure very high cavitation rates as a function of pressure; and (3) imaging rapidly evolving nanobubbles using femtosecond X-ray laser scattering. Additionally, liquid jet ablation experiments will be designed and used to quantify a poorly understood type of cavitation that occurs in pure water.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Buoyant material, such as floating debris, marine organisms, oil and microplastics may be aggregated and trapped within estuaries or dispersed and discharged to the coastal ocean by these transport processes. Strong convergent surface flows across the estuary organize buoyant material into laterally narrow near-surface patches that may extend up to a few kilometers along the estuary. Local currents that move these patches may substantially differ from tidally and laterally averaged currents, which are often used to estimate estuarine transport characteristics. A major objective of this project is to contrast the transport of material in a frame work that follows the flow, known as the Lagrangian framework, with one based on a fixed point reference frame, or the Eulerian framework.  Often the Lagrangian trajectories of material differ from those inferred from the Eulerian mean flows. The classic example stems from surface waves where the average velocity at a point (Eulerian) will be zero but a particle oscillating with the wave included flow will have an average velocity in the direction of wave propagation, due to the Stokes drift or Stokes velocity.  This project will investigate the importance of Stokes transport in estuaries. The project research hypotheses are: (1) Stokes transport associated with amplitude and phase structure of tidal flows contribute significantly to the transport of buoyant material in both the along-channel and cross- channel directions. (2) Buoyant material organizes in surface patches due to the lateral estuarine circulations. (3) Patches of buoyant material are fundamentally transported by spatiotemporally localized currents that vary substantially across the estuary. (4) The observed spatiotemporal distributions of marine debris in Delaware Bay are a characteristic signature of Lagrangian estuarine transport. The project will use both modeling and observations to address transport of buoyant material in estuaries. This research will help solve practical real world problems related to marine pollution, gas exchange and fisheries. The PIs have close working relationships with resource managers and policy makers with whom they will communicate relevant new understanding. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students, and both PIs and students will participate in public outreach events. <br/> <br/>This project will examine transport of buoyant material in estuaries, specifically the Delaware Estuary, including its aggregation within estuaries, and the effects of resulting patchiness of buoyant material on its transport through the estuary. The hypotheses will be addressed through an integrated research program that employs original concept models as well as observations and simulations. Research objectives include: (1) Assess and advance idealized linear and weakly-nonlinear models of the three-dimensional estuarine circulations to determine key factors that control secondary circulations, such as bathymetry, tides, Coriolis force, and baroclinicity. (2) Develop and evaluate a Lagrangian framework for the estuarine circulation based on the integration of the idealized models with existing field observations and an asymptotic Stokes drift analysis to contrast fundamental differences between the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. (3) Conduct and integrate hydrodynamic simulations and field observations of the Delaware Estuary to understand tidal neap-spring and high-low river discharge variability. (4) Apply the Lagrangian framework to simulation and observation results, as well as recent marine debris observations, to reveal principal Lagrangian transport characteristics and improved estuarine transport estimates. By exploring and developing a Lagrangian framework this project would fundamentally advance our understanding of the physics of estuarine transport processes. This work will transform the current paradigm of estuarine material transport to include new lateral transport processes, thereby advancing the current conceptual understanding of buoyant tracer dynamics in an estuary, and will contribute to solving practical real world problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Downburst wind events are one of the main causes for high wind intensity associated with thunderstorms, which account for significant civil infrastructure damage and fatalities on a yearly basis in the United States and worldwide. There is a major gap in knowledge, considering that the nature of downburst impact on buildings is different and more complex than for straight-line wind and hurricanes. Field measurements are needed to inform large-scale physical simulations and numerical modeling to assess the vulnerability of buildings subjected to downbursts and help close this knowledge gap. In addition, design recommendations to mitigate the impact of downburst events on buildings are currently not available. This award will leverage available national and international downburst field measurements through integrated research and educational collaborations with the University of Genoa (UniGe) in Italy and the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign to determine a target range of parameters to inform physical-based simulations of downburst actions on buildings using the National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Wall of Wind (WOW) facility at Florida International University. The multi-disciplinary, meteorology, wind and structural engineering, and multi-institution research and educational collaboration comprising this project will offer unique research opportunities for students to engage in state-of-the art STEM studies at an international institution. The research outcomes will enable climate-responsive collaboration and fundamentally transformative concepts to mitigate the impact of downburst-driven hazards on civil infrastructure. This award will contribute to the NSF role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). <br/><br/>This project will address three integrated research and education aims: (1) bridge the gap between meteorology and wind engineering paradigms to inform experimental simulation methods at the NHERI WOW facility to produce realistic downburst flow and to assess the uncertainty in the resulting flow field, (2) analyze and understand the downburst aerodynamic loading on buildings and possible aeroelastic effects using large-scale testing at the NHERI WOW facility, and (3) integrate downburst flow characteristics and aerodynamic and aeroelastic loading research into interconnected educational activities to prepare the next generation of researchers and teachers in the field of windstorm hazards. The virtual exchange through the Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) module with the UniGe will provide an international educational experience for underrepresented minorities in the STEM field.

Behavioral studies have demonstrated that blindfolded seals are able to use their uniquely-shaped whiskers to track hydrodynamic trails that were generated several minutes ago and discriminate the size and shape of upstream objects through their wakes. However, relatively little is known regarding the fundamental mechanisms driving the extraordinary sensing capabilities. The principal aim of this project is to advance our understanding of seal whisker sensing that result from its unique geometry by elucidating the roles of each geometric feature. The acquired knowledge will be transformative by inspiring innovative passive hydrodynamic sensing mechanisms associated with seal whisker geometry. The research will be integrated with a creative, bio-inspired engineering education plan to impact undergraduate and graduate engineering students, as well as students in grades 3-12, and the general public.<br/><br/>The research will employ numerical fluid-structure interaction simulations to comprehensively characterize the individual and interactive effects of the geometric features of seal whisker on three aspects of its sensing, including (1) self-induced noises in calm waters caused by vortex-induced vibrations, (2) wake detection through wake-induced vibrations, and (3) whisker array signals. An in-house immersed-boundary-method based fluid-structure interaction solver will be used for parametric simulations of vortex-induced vibrations and wake-induced vibrations of a single whisker and multiple whiskers in wide ranges of geometric and flow parameters. The simulation results will be validated by comparing to the previously-obtained experimental measurements using the particle image velocimetry. The amplitude and frequency responses of the vibrations of different geometric models will be characterized in the parametric space. Empirical functions for vibration response characterizations will be derived. The underlying vortex dynamics and energy transfer mechanisms in terms of the interactions between the fluid forces and body displacement will be studied for understanding the vibration responses. The knowledge will not only inspire innovative hydrodynamic sensing mechanisms based on seal whisker geometry, but also contribute to the fundamental understanding of flow-induced vibration properties of bluff and slender bodies, which can have applications across broad engineering fields. The research will also investigate the signal patterns in the whisker arrays and their relationships with wake characteristics, which will have implications regarding the impact of array architecture in capturing wake information.

Due to their varying levels of tolerance to pollution and disturbance, caddisflies are also one of the primary invertebrate groups used for biological monitoring of water quality. The family Hydroptilidae, known as the ?microcaddisflies? due to their small body size of 1.5-5 mm, are an extremely diverse family of caddisflies with over 2,600 known species occurring around the world and potentially many 100s of undescribed species. Microcaddisflies display a wide range of ecological, morphological, and behavioral diversity and occur in interesting distributional patterns around the world, none of which has been explored in the context of the evolutionary relationships within the family. Current understanding of the microcaddisfly evolutionary history suffers from a lack of statistically-supported analyses, inconsistent use of morphological features, and very little inclusion of molecular data. This research will focus on reconstructing the evolutionary history of this diverse, yet under-studied, group of insects. The broader impacts of this research include the training of one PhD student and multiple undergraduates in modern taxonomy and systematics; a new course in the Museum Studies program that will introduce students to the importance of insect diversity, provide hands-on experience with specimen collection and curation, and increase awareness of related legal and ethical issues surrounding collections; and a noncredit course exploring insect biodiversity to be offered to a community of lifelong learners.<br/><br/>A combined approach of molecular and morphological data, applied for the first time with modern statistical methods and analytical techniques, will be used to assess the evolutionary history of the microcaddisflies (Trichoptera: Hydroptilidae), a diverse yet under-studied taxon. Researchers will (1) infer the first total-evidence phylogeny of the family Hydroptilidae, which will include the first morphological assessment of homology across the family and the first molecular dataset to cover the entire family using targeted enrichment techniques; (2) use the constructed phylogeny to shed light on subfamilies and genera in need of taxonomic updates, revisionary monographs, and new species descriptions; and (3) determine biogeographic and divergence time estimates that will add to a more detailed profile of hydroptilid evolutionary history. These approaches will provide new insight into hydroptilid phylogenetics and allow for future research on character evolution within Hydroptilidae, diversification and speciation rates relative to the rest of Trichoptera, and larger questions of evolution applied across the order.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When driven through porous materials, viscoelastic fluids exhibit an abrupt transition to chaotic flow, which is a key feature of enhanced mixing that regulates a vast array of important geological, biological, and industrial processes. Despite our deep understanding of viscoelastic flows in simple model geometries, predicting their flow properties through the intricate, irregular crevices of porous materials remains an outstanding challenge. The goal of this work is to quantify viscoelastic fluid flows in a range of model and realistic porous media and determine how microscopic geometry affects the macroscopic flow and transport properties of viscoelastic fluids. The outcomes of this project will have direct implications for extraction and bioremediation efficiency in rock and soil, minimizing power consumption and cost in polymer processing, and understanding biofilm mechanics that affect soil ecology and infections in humans. Under this project, workshops will be organized to promote early career development of scientists in the field, several undergraduate and graduate students will receive research training, and aspects of this work will be integrated into microfluidics and complex fluids courses.<br/><br/><br/>The stability of viscoelastic fluid flows through porous media strongly depends upon the disorder and connectivity of successive pores. The memory of elastic stresses couples advection to pore microstructure making for exquisitely complex stability criteria, and emphasizing the need to consider the Lagrangian character of polymeric flows. A dearth of quantitative studies across relevant two- and three-dimensional flow geometries has yielded often conflicting outcomes and has inhibited our ability to forecast the dispersive transport properties of these systems. To resolve these key deficiencies in our current understanding of viscoelastic flows through porous media, the following principle aims will be achieved through the integration of microfluidic experiments and numerical simulations: (1) Determine the role of geometrical structure, disorder, and porosity on viscoelastic instability in two-dimensional porous media flows. (2) Establish the effect of geometry and viscoelasticity on dispersion in porous media through analysis of Lagrangian coherent structures. (3) Elucidate the role of three-dimensionality in the viscoelastic stability and resultant transport properties of porous media flows.

Although key components and auxiliary partners of mi-RISC have been identified and studied, many new regulatory layers or factors are still being recovered; and the precise mechanisms remain to be exploited. Using a novel genetic screening approach, the PI has identified a new gene, ?2-COP that encodes a subunit of COPI, as a new player in the miRNA pathway. The central hypothesis is that COPI is responsible for delivering components of mi-RISC and/or P-bodies to their functional sites to impact RNA silencing. The PI will apply a series of genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches to test this hypothesis.

However, less than 5% of spent LIBs are currently recycled. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an environmentally friendly and economically viable LIB recycling technology to manage the hazardous, albeit valuable, large volumes of spent LIBs. This project will systematically explore a direct recycling process that could potentially maximize the return value from end-of-life LIBs, aiming to recover and reuse the most valuable cathode material in spent LIBs for new LIB manufacturing. The outcomes of the project will facilitate the development of direct cathode recycling that contributes to minimizing the environmental impacts of LIB wastes, securing the future supply of battery raw materials, lowering the cost of LIB production, and improving the sustainability of the LIB industry. The research results will be broadly disseminated through academic journals, conferences, science festivals, and educational videos, inspiring new ideas for LIB recycling technologies and improving people?s understanding of the economic and environmental impacts of LIB recycling. Furthermore, students of various education levels, especially underrepresented minorities and women in the STEM fields, will be trained by providing hands-on laboratory experiences. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to establish a fundamental understanding of the effectiveness of direct recycling on spent cathodes at different degrees of degradation. Given the fact that end-of-life LIBs are generated under different cycling conditions, the spent cathodes are expected to exhibit various levels of degradation that involve lithium loss, irreversible phase transformation, inter/intragranular cracking, dissolution of transition metals, and surface layer formation. To simulate the spent cathodes at various degradation conditions and how they are regenerated by a direct recycling process, different types of chemically delithiated cathodes are synthesized, characterized, and regenerated. This project seeks to attain its primary goal by pursuing two specific aims: (1) to examine the chemical, structural, and electrochemical stabilities of chemically delithiated cathodes during solvent-based separation processing and (2) to determine the effectiveness of direct cathode regeneration for rejuvenating chemically delithiated cathodes at different degradation extents.

Today, dynamic stability concerns fundamentally limit the contribution of renewable generation in large-scale power systems. The project will bring transformative change to electric power systems by increasing sustainability, enhancing resilience to severe weather events, and contributing to the decarbonization of the U.S. economy. This will be achieved by innovations in modeling and control of power electronics and renewable energy resources that will enable their full participation in ensuring system stability and resilience. The intellectual merits of the project include developing new optimization-based control paradigms for grid-connected power electronics and analysis methods that will provide a principled understanding of the dynamics of large-scale power systems dominated by renewable generation and power electronics. The broader impacts of the project include increased sustainability and reliability of electric power systems and improved mitigation of and recovery from severe weather events. The project will also address integration of power electronics, control, and power systems education and contribute to developing a diverse and globally competitive power engineering and green-collar workforce. <br/><br/>How to control grid-connected power electronics and renewable generation with limited flexibility to ensure dynamic stability of zero-carbon electric power systems is not well understood. The main technical focus of this project is to develop a framework for control design and stability analysis that (i) explicitly accounts for static and dynamic constraints of power electronics and renewable generation, and (ii) prevents adverse dynamic interactions between controls and physics on overlapping time scales. Solving this complex problem will require new models, control approaches, and tailored tools for stability analysis. A particular focus will be on control techniques that (i) enable seamless integration of vast numbers of distributed power-electronic devices by inducing collaborative dynamics, and (ii) autonomously leverage their combined flexibility to reduce the need for centralized coordination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, hydrophobic particles have been used to mitigate groundwater/wastewater contamination and improve enhanced oil recovery due to their long-term transport stability. Therefore, a better understanding of the transport and fate of such particles is an essential step towards sustainable resources for human health, well-being, and societal benefits. Despite these critical social and technological impacts, the physics of hydrophobic particles have not yet been fully explained theoretically nor reproduced in simulations and experiments due to their complex dynamics. This project is to provide a deep understanding of the key transport mechanisms enhancing the transportability of hydrophobic particles. The project will also promote extensive outreach activities, such as mobile labs, to specifically target rural areas and bridge the urban-rural divide in education.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to elucidate the dynamics and rheology of hydrophobic particles in a confined suspension via computational modeling and simulations along with microfluidic experimental validation. High-fidelity simulations based on the Stokesian dynamics approach will be applied to study the effects of various hydrophobicity, such as coating properties, on particle dynamics in a suspension. The central hypothesis is that the presence of hydrophobicity on the particle surface will enhance its transportability due to an enhanced particle migration toward the center of the geometry, especially at high concentrations under confinement. In pursuit of this goal, the specific objectives are: 1) establish a mathematical model for hydrophobic particles in which slip velocity can vary depending on local concentrations and flow strengths; 2) establish a computational framework to efficiently simulate a suspension of hydrophobic particles under confinement; 3) elucidate the dynamics and rheology of the sheared suspension; and 4) validate the computational results using microfluidic experiments to improve the model and underlying assumptions. The discovery that particle migration can be enhanced at high concentrations naturally suggests the existence of non-trivial rheological behaviors. In this regard, one broad theme related to examining concentrated suspensions is shear-thickening. Thus, this project is expected to provide a new understanding of shear-thickening that could be tuned by surface hydrophobicity. This new knowledge has far-reaching implications in a broad spectrum of applications because shear-thickening is widely adopted in defense and environmental systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New technologies enhancing environmental sustainability, defense capability, and consumer products have sharply increased the demand for the REE. However, the supply of REE in the U.S. relies mostly on their import from foreign sources. Furthermore, many of the domestic deposits suffer from high concentrations of thorium (Th) and uranium (U) that contaminate the environment during mining. To deal with this issue, it is necessary to discover the conditions needed for economic concentrations of the REE to form in nature in the absence of Th or U; this requires understanding how Th and U mix with the REE in minerals and how such mixing can be avoided. This project will explore how Th and U mix with the REE in minerals through a combination of experiments and geological modeling. These results will make it possible to predict the natural environments in which Th- and U-poor REE minerals form and thereby provide geologists with the information they need to develop strategies to explore for and locate deposits of REE that can be economically and safely mined. This project also aims to educate high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in geochemistry, and prepare them for careers as scientists. The integrated education plan is committed to holding summer geochemistry schools for high school students, promoting geochemical education to student through visits to national laboratories and virtual lectures, and engaging students in the experimental and modeling methods that are used in the research project.<br/><br/>The objective of this research proposal is to generate new knowledge enabling identification of the conditions under which Th and U-depleted REE phosphate ores can form. One of the major impediments to the recovery of REE from ores in the U.S. is the radioactivity generated during their processing and refining due to the presence of high concentrations of Th and U in the main REE ore minerals, monazite and xenotime. Thus, there is a strong need to find Th, U-depleted REE ores, which, in turn, depends on developing a better understanding of their formation conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, pH, etc.), particularly those for which the incorporation of Th and U into phosphate structures is minimal. Whereas the properties of the aqueous species of the REE, U, and Th are now reasonably well-known for the hydrothermal conditions of REE ore formation, there is almost no information on phosphate-based REE/U/Th solid solutions. A major challenge is to correctly account for thermodynamic non-ideality due to the mixing of Th and U with the REE, which is often incorrectly assumed to be ideal and thus can lead to inaccurate or false predictions. This project will establish accurate thermodynamic models describing the incorporation of Th and U in REE phosphates that are critically needed by geochemical modelers to predict the mobilization, fractionation, and deposition of REE/U/Th in hydrothermal systems. The knowledge obtained will enable the development of new exploration techniques permitting the identification and localization of Th- and U-depleted REE ores. The project also offers unique opportunities for students to receive the interdisciplinary education and training needed to become geochemists with broad mindsets and skillsets. This includes summer geochemistry schools for high school students and teachers to develop their interest in the geochemistry of the REE and other critical metals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, wildfire and warming may speed up decomposition rates in the soil, but this trend can be slowed if the plant community produces leaves that are thicker and tougher to decompose. Ecosystems are shaped by disturbances like fire, and when these disturbances change, some species may be unable to survive. This project examines how fire severity and experimental warming interact to shape plant traits, plant communities, and multiple ecosystem functions such as decomposition and plant productivity. The project studies ponderosa pine forest understory communities in Arizona. This work is of critical importance as the climate warms and increasingly severe fires occur over large area of the western United States. Results from the study provide valuable information about biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem stability in the future. In addition, the project trains a new generation of scientists in ecosystem science.<br/><br/>The project implements an experimental manipulation of temperature that mimics future climate scenarios across a fire severity gradient that encompasses a range of fire severities.  The project addresses three key hypotheses: 1) Fire severity, climate alteration, and their interactions will strengthen abiotic filtering relative to untreated controls; 2) Fire severity, climate alterations, and their interactions will reduce plant trait diversity relative to untreated controls; and 3) The relative importance of indirect, plant mediated effects of fire severity and climate alterations will increase over time, ultimately leading to a reduction in ecosystem function in burned and warmed plots. Changes in the plant community and ecosystem function are quantified, and then used to calculate two metrics of ecosystem function. Finally, structural equation modelling is used to answer our overarching research question: How does the understory plant community mediate the effects of fire severity and climate change on ecosystem multifunction over time?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unrepaired DNA damage interferes with cellular functions such as replication and transcription, often resulting in mutations and genome instability. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a major DNA repair pathway that removes structurally diverse lesions caused by UV, fuel combustion, industrial pollutants, cigarette smoke, etc. in DNA. Defects in NER can cause hyper-UV sensitivity and increase mutations that lead to diseases including cancers in humans. This project aims to obtain detailed molecular and structural understanding of critical steps in the initiation of NER. Technical innovations in this project will be applicable to many other systems involving complex and dynamic protein-DNA interactions. The research will provide cross-disciplinary training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate researchers and enhance the biomedical research environment at Baylor University through close collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania medical school. Outreach activities will include participation in an Advanced Instrumentation Workshop at Baylor, held for faculty and students from local colleges/universities with limited access to high-level instrumentation; development of a research-based biology curriculum ?Guardians of the Genome? in collaboration with a high school in Texas, and public demonstrations through the NSF-funded ?Portal to the Public? program at Baylor?s Mayborn Museum.<br/><br/>NER is an essential genome maintenance mechanism whose molecular machinery is conserved in all eukaryotes ranging from yeast to humans. Though much is known about the biochemical steps of NER, little is known at the structural level due to challenges in preparing key multiprotein complexes (e.g., TFIIH and Rad4 (yeast homolog of mammalian XPC)) on suitable NER lesions for structural studies. Building on the team?s prior successes and by combining cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), cross-linking/mass spectrometry (XL-MS), and fluorescence lifetime (FLT)-based conformational analyses as well as yeast genetics, this project aims at comprehensive understanding of NER initiation through dynamic 3-D views of the complex structures and their transitions. Specifically, the project will address: (1) How TFIIH-Rad4 first starts unwinding the DNA on bona fide NER lesions, (2) How holoTFIIH is activated for NER by disengaging the transcription-specific TFIIK kinase module, and (3) How the TFIIH-Rad4 complex transitions to lesion verification stage. This research using the yeast system will also open new doors to understanding various NER-linked phenotypes in humans and shed light on how NER may be modulated in vivo.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and Molecular Biophysics programs of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Biological Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The entire summer activities are designed to facilitate community college students to seek jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields or pursue education in four-year research university and develop meaningful relationships with faculty and students. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Innovative materials and their broader use are vital to improve the structural reliability and life cycle performance of ships and maritime structures, to lower their environmental footprint, to make maritime industries more viable at a global scale and thus to generate and sustain employment. Many young scientists in STEM disciplines are naturally fascinated by these outstanding challenges as they search for a greater drive for their education and meaningful ways to serve society. The overarching goal of this REU site is to prepare scholars to address the challenges in advanced materials and fill critical gaps in knowledge on materials needed to transform marine technologies. The REU participants at this site conduct independent research on projects that will leverage and advance a wide range of studies on novel materials currently underway at UMassD, including: nonaqueous redox flow batteries, multi-functional sandwich composites, functional composite materials for structural energy storage, underwater super-hydrophobic surfaces, tactile sensors, bioinspired photonic materials, meta-materials, granular materials, and nanostructured surfaces for antifouling. With the inter-disciplinary nature of these research projects, faculty and students interact and advance the materials science across different fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This NSF CAREER project aims to substantially reduce this need by improving the transfer capability of the existing transmission network. This will be achieved by designing new markets that provide incentive for efficient operation of flexible transmission. It is expected that such incentives will lead to enhanced utilization of the existing grid and pave the way for innovation, making the nation?s power grid more modern, flexible, resilient, and economical.  The intellectual merits of the project include development of new theories and methods that enable deregulated and market-based operation of flexible transmission, as opposed to today?s regulated structure. Guided by engineering and economics principles, the project will ensure that the power flows stay within the limits, social welfare is improved, and the market is revenue adequate. The broader impacts of the project include substantial savings in avoided new transmission project costs, enhancement of the efficiency of the nation?s electric power infrastructure and offering an economical pathway to adoption of increased renewable generation. Additionally, the project includes educational and outreach activities that will provide cutting-edge training opportunities in optimization, economics, and public policy, contributing to the advancement of the nation?s workforce. <br/><br/>Flexible transmission, including topology control, nodal voltage phase control, and line impedance control, can significantly increase the transfer capability over the existing network. Despite the availability of the technology, deployment of flexible transmission has been rather limited, mainly due to lack of incentives. This CAREER project will develop theories, methods, and algorithms to offer market-based incentives for efficient operation of flexible transmission, based on the state of the system. The project will investigate two different market designs, based on: (i) allocation of financial transmission rights, and (ii) marginal value payments. The potential for exercise of market power within each design will also be studied, which will lead to regulatory guidelines for preventing market manipulation. The efficiency of the designs will be rigorously tested based on three criteria: (i) social welfare improvement, (ii) revenue adequacy, and (iii) computational tractability. The final market design, satisfying the efficiency criteria, will enable widespread utilization of flexible transmission technologies. While the project will formulate a linear market, ensuring compatibility with existing electricity market designs, the impacts of nonlinearity in power flow equations will be thoroughly investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, many chemical and pharmaceutical processing techniques involve droplets breaking as components mix and react. Droplet breakage is also important in environmental applications such as the dynamics of oil spills and their cleanup, and in the leakage of underground storage tanks into water sources.  Scientists and engineers have worked to develop computational techniques to predict complex fluid processes such as those listed above. A key component of these computational techniques are models that accurately describe droplet breakage and its dependence on flow parameters such as turbulence intensity and droplet properties such as viscosity, surface tension, diameter, and density.  This project will conduct a series of experiments to measure droplet breakage under highly controlled conditions.  Data from the experiments will be used to improve droplet breakage models.<br/><br/>This project will investigate effects of turbulence intensity and fluid properties on droplet breakage by performing detailed experiments and using these data to improve and validate droplet breakage models. In the experiments, individual droplets will be injected into a flow chamber that has been designed to generate a uniform turbulent field. The turbulent field will be characterized using particle image velocimetry.  High-speed movies will be captured of the droplet as it is deformed and then broken by the turbulence. The experiments will be repeated for different droplet diameters and fluids, and large ensembles of droplet breakage movies will be analyzed statistically to yield data on the droplet breakup process, including droplet size and shape. Moreover, because the timing of successive images in the movies will be known, droplet breakage event timings and frequencies can be determined by analyzing each image sequence. Graduate and undergraduate students will work on this project.

The research will investigate a brain region involved in the analysis of visual shape information, identifying its organization and its role in perception. The research will employ a powerful combination of approaches: measuring and perturbing the activity of specific subsets of brain cells during behavior. The project also includes educational activities for disseminating core concepts of the research to the general public. The educational activities will focus on pre-college (K?12) students. New teaching materials, exhibit demos and lab-based workshops will be developed in collaboration with the non-profit organization ?BioBus? and with public outreach programs at Columbia University?s Zuckerman Institute. Each activity will highlight a core principle of the research, thereby creating a fruitful integration of research and education. <br/><br/>The CAREER project endeavors to deepen our understanding of the neural basis of visual shape perception in primates.

The first class of experiments will use laminar recordings to characterize the organization of shape-selective neurons across V4 cortical layers. Findings from these experiments have the potential to clarify the circuit-level mechanisms underlying visual shape analysis, and may reveal key organizing principles of higher-order cortical circuits in primates. The second class of experiments will use optogenetic silencing to assess the causal role of V4 activity in the ability to perceive fine differences in shape. Findings from these experiments have the potential to establish a direct role for this cortical area in visual shape perception.

In particular, such concerns exist for applications that collect private user information, as in health monitoring, e-commerce, and financial services, and applications associated with critical infrastructure as in transportation, smart grids, or process supervisory management systems. Indeed, for these applications, a single compromised/malicious agent or node of the network can provoke catastrophic events such as ransom payments to recover private data, large-scale electricity blackouts, interruptions of service, data breaches, financial losses, or fatalities. This project aims to explore how distributing the authority to launch critical tasks in the hands of multiple, rather than a single, nodes or users of the network can be an efficient means to avoid having a single point of failure and hence losing private data in its entirety in the case of a security breach. Furthermore, the proposed research studies how authority distribution is able to empower networks with the capability of coping with compromised devices or persons before they are identified as malicious and, most importantly, before they are able to do any harm.<br/><br/>The project investigates novel solutions beyond traditional threshold cryptography to address challenging roadblocks in authority distribution for data access and biometric authentication. Specifically, the project aims to overcome (i) privacy challenges with the use of biometrics, (ii) the need for costly resources as perfectly secure communication channels, (iii) a poor scaling behavior with the number of users, and (iv) the need for a central entity which is not compatible with distributed systems, to unravel fundamental trade-offs between privacy and storage requirements. The project comprises three interrelated thrusts. The first thrust studies the fundamental security and privacy guarantees that authority distribution can offer in the presence of, potentially unnoticed, compromised users or nodes. The second thrust investigates the construction of low-complexity coding schemes for authority distribution that operate at finite blocklengths, based on novel methods derived from error control coding and cryptography. The third thrust aims to enable a universal learning framework for authority distribution via deep learning that is independent of the data statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All living cells must be able to reorganize their contents rapidly to function properly.  To promote intracellular movements, motor proteins transport cellular material throughout the eukaryotic cell.  Some motors move along tracks called microtubules that function as cellular highways.  Nearly everything that must move around the cell is transported by motor proteins, from smaller proteins to organelles like mitochondria.  If motor proteins? functions are impaired, cells can die or malfunction.  Remarkably, only one type of motor, called dynein, transports cargo towards the interior of the cell for long distances. As the only such motor, dynein must be able to bind and transport many different types of cellular cargo, even though each kind of cargo may need to move at different speeds, be vastly different in size, or move only at specific times.  A second set of proteins, called adaptors, bind to dynein and enable it to transport different types of cargos. The goal of this proposal is to understand how different adaptor proteins enable dynein motors to move cargos of different sizes at different speeds at different times. The expected results will reveal how adaptor proteins alter the characteristics of dynein to display different motile properties.  This research project will also train both undergraduate and graduate students in microscopy and biophysical techniques, and to communicating experimental findings to a broad public audience using non-traditional approaches such as dance and theater.  A collaboration in conjunction with the University of Michigan?s Museum of Natural History will also develop hands-on, research-driven programs for middle and high-school-aged students to learn about fluorescence microscopy and motor proteins.<br/><br/>The research of this project will address how a class of cellular proteins, called adaptors, enable dynein to traffic diverse cargoes.  Preliminary work has revealed that individual adaptor proteins confer distinct motile properties to the mammalian dynein-1 motor.  To build on this finding, the investigators will:  1) Determine why different adaptors have distinct effects on dynein motility; 2) Determine how each adaptor tunes the activity of teams of dynein motors; 3) Determine how each adaptor specifically modulates activation of the dynein motor.  To accomplish these goals, the investigators will use single-molecule fluorescence imaging, protein biochemistry, complex in vitro reconstitutions to generate teams of motors on a native-like cargo, and real-time fluorescence microscopic visualization of dynein activation on microtubules and in solution.  Together, the results of this proposal will provide an in-depth understanding of how adaptor proteins increase the functional plasticity of the dynein motor, and increase progress towards a holistic understanding of how trafficking is coordinated across the entire cell.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It seeks to build a teacher education program that will prepare prospective teachers to teach secondary mathematics using innovative teaching approaches that combine mathematical modeling, emerging technologies, and culturally responsive practices. The project involves hands-on coursework and rich field experiences in secondary classrooms at partner schools. These experiences have the potential to build preservice teachers? skills in teaching mathematics and in meaningfully incorporating students? cultural backgrounds and home languages in school learning. A comprehensive induction support system will include mathematics coaches who will provide instructional and social-emotional support to the secondary mathematics teachers to promote their retention in high-need schools upon completion of the project. Project outcomes include the certification of secondary mathematics teachers who will be supported into careers in high-need schools, and the establishment of a vigorous teacher education program that will continue to fill documented workforce shortages even after the conclusion of funding.  <br/><br/>This project at Penn State Harrisburg (PSH) includes partnerships with Harrisburg, Central Dauphin, Middletown Area, Steelton-Highspire, and Susquehanna Township School Districts. Project goals include enhancing the current teacher certification program and increasing the number of certified secondary mathematics teachers who will be well prepared to make a positive difference in secondary students? learning of mathematics through long-term careers in high-need classrooms.

Encasing the drop with NPs prevents the drops from coalescing with each other, which makes this special kind of emulsion of great interest. A mixture of NPs that preferentially interact with each other will be synthesized so that they undergo a phase separation at the interface, producing drops that have patchy areas of different NPs on their interfaces. Tailoring the structure of the interface in this way will enable control over the spatial arrangement that a large collection of drops assumes when they are forced to pack closely together. This technique can be used to produce objects with distinct interconnection points and channels between adjacent drops.  Such constructs would provide access to transduction pathways for the transport of charges, particulates, or chemicals from one compartment to another and would form the basis for materials with controlled optical, magnetic and transport properties.  The research team will develop outreach activities for junior high and high school students in critically important areas of STEM training with hands-on participation in laboratory research. This reinforcement of foundational principles in STEM at early educational stages will help address opportunity inequities of students from underrepresented groups and will contribute to an educational pipeline for the benefit of all participants.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to design functionalized nanoparticles that phase separate on the interface of liquid drops in ways that promote controlled 3D arrangements of drops and, ultimately, the formation of macroscopic structures with unique properties.  NPs dispersed in one liquid that are coated with ligands dissolved in a second immiscible liquid are nanoparticle surfactants with high binding energy to the interface.  The project will explore using heterogeneous interfacial assemblies of functionalized NP mixtures that undergo 2D phase separation to form droplets with interfaces having distinct NP domains from which hierarchical assemblies of drops will be generated.  Furthermore, NP reorganization at the liquid-liquid interface can generate inter-droplet channels as an interconnected, compartmentalized system having transduction pathways, dictated by the interactions between the ligands and the 2D phase separated morphologies, for transport, separations, and flow-through media. The project will focus on the fundamental underpinnings of functionalized nanoparticle surfactant assemblies (NSAs).  Experiments will probe the synthesis of ligand-functionalized NPs for generating NSAs and the in situ characterization of the structure and dynamics of NSAs on liquid droplets. They will be accompanied by simulations that predict the phase behavior of mixed NSAs and investigation of macroscopic 3D arrays of mixed NSAs.

Dedicated regulators of sipA expression and protein interaction partners have been identified, but little else is known about this essential stress response mechanism. Due to the conservation of SipA, it may be a key stress response protein in numerous bacteria. Therefore, the goals of this proposal are to fully characterize the regulation of this stress response system, establish the mechanism(s) by which SipA contributes to stress survival, and determine how this system is integrated with other biological processes in V. cholerae.

However, challenges remain in bringing these mostly academic findings to the scale necessary for industrial adoption, limiting the benefits to society that would result from safer and milder chemical processing conditions. An important factor in restricting the scalability of photochemical processes is that while high light absorptivity of the feedstocks is desirable for reaction efficiency, it also limits light penetration depth into the reaction medium. Commonly used photocatalysts can also be prohibitively expensive, and residual catalyst impurities in the final products often leads to discoloration or degradation. To address these limitations, this CAREER project will study the use of photocatalyst-coated optical fibers to guide light into the reactor vessels. If successful, the proposed work will lay the scientific foundations to facilitate the implementation of modern photochemistry on an industrial scale and enhance the impact of academic photo-reaction engineering innovations. Immobilizing photocatalysts on optical fibers is anticipated to improve light-penetration and efficiency of the catalytic process. Because the catalysts are immobilized and will not be added continuously with the reactor feed, the proposed approach will improve the process economics and will provide a path to manufacturing both pristine small molecules and polymers free of catalyst impurities. Eliminating such impurities is of importance for synthesis of high purity chemicals in biomedical and electronic applications where trace metals can introduce toxicity or be detrimental to device performance. The research plans have the potential to accelerate the implementation of modern and mild photochemistries on large scales and benefit society by helping to bridge the academia-industry divide. Education and outreach activities will also benefit from the close academia-industry ties to be developed, connecting undergraduate and graduate students and potential employers through field trips and panel discussions with industry leadership. Further, this program will develop and distribute inexpensive polymer science laboratory kits that will benefit underserved middle and high school students by improving access to a quality STEM education experience.<br/><br/>This CAREER project will provide the fundamental engineering knowledge needed to translate academic advances in modern photochemistry to large-scale industrial applications. The objectives of this research program are to identify critical chemical structure-property relationships for organic photoredox catalysts that will enable surface-grafting to immobilizing substrates without affecting catalytic activity. By investigating a range of approaches to control the optical fiber evanescent field, optical fiber surface-tethered catalysts will subsequently be tested as heterogeneous photocatalysts in both batch and continuous-flow reactor systems. Catalyst surface density will be controlled through a combination of surface monolayer grafting and the use of bottlebrush polymer tethers. Once an optimal fiber unit spacing and distribution is identified, process throughput and scalability will no longer limited by light absorption, but exclusively by the size of the reactor. By bringing light into the reactor, Beer-Lambert absorption limitations will be circumvented to provide a highly scalable continuous throughput methodology. Because the photocatalyst is immobilized within the reactor (and not continuously added), it can be recycled for multiple reactions; furthermore, the final chemical product will be free of catalyst impurities, a condition necessary in many pharmaceutical and electronics chemical products. From an educational and outreach perspective, this program will broadly impact students of all ages and backgrounds by forming a coalition between university entities, rural schools, and industrial partners. The principal investigator will increase interfaces between undergraduate and graduate students and potential employers through field trips and panel discussions with industry leadership. Further, this program will pilot and distribute inexpensive at-cost polymer science laboratory kits to secondary students to benefit underserved middle and high school students by improving their access to quality STEM education. Finally, targeted community outreach events will promote university enrollment of socioeconomically challenged students while communicating scientific principles and the importance of sustainability and plastic waste recycling to non-technical audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research focuses on an ecosystem, Lake Myvatn, that is simple in terms of the species that exist there, and is naturally unstable. Of the moderate number of herbivores in the lake, one has an outsized effect, a species of midge -- a non-biting, mosquito-sized insect -- that in its juvenile stage feeds at the bottom of the lake. In some years, the total weight of all adult midges swarming out of the lake is equivalent to the weight of 100 humpback whales, while in other years the total weight is equivalent to a few golden retrievers. These fluctuations in midge abundances are unpredictable, with natural crashes occurring every 4 to 10 years. The crashes are not caused by weather or anything outside the lake, and appear to be part of a natural instability of the lake itself. Many components of the lake ecosystem changes with midge fluctuations, from the breeding success of birds that depend on the midges as food to the activity of microbes that perform essential chemistry for the lake ecosystem. These processes occur in all ecosystems, but ecosystems that show this type of instability are extremely rare. By understanding what makes the Myvatn ecosystem naturally unstable, we can learn what makes other ecosystems as stable as they are, thereby giving us insight into predicting and managing other less-extreme ecosystems. The project will train graduate students and undergraduate interns.<br/><br/>	The research involves both long-term collection of biological and biogeochemical data from the Myvatn ecosystem and targeted experiments to test specific hypotheses. The data collection builds and expands on an existing long term database, with monitoring of some variables starting in the 1970s (adult midges) and 1980s (zooplankton, stickleback fish). The project has added weekly monitoring of many additional variables, including midge larval density, benthic primary production, and pelagic and benthic nutrients. The targeted experiments cover a wide range of research questions including (i) the role that midges play as ecosystem engineers, changing benthic conditions to increase primary production and possibly change nutrient cycling, (ii) the fluctuations in benthic ecosystem processes caused by spatiotemporal fluctuations in midge abundances and pelagic cyanobacteria blooms, and (iii) changes in benthic and algal species composition as both consequences and causes of midge population fluctuations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, such concerns exist for applications that collect private user information, as in health monitoring, e-commerce, and financial services, and applications associated with critical infrastructure as in transportation, smart grids, or process supervisory management systems. Indeed, for these applications, a single compromised/malicious agent or node of the network can provoke catastrophic events such as ransom payments to recover private data, large-scale electricity blackouts, interruptions of service, data breaches, financial losses, or fatalities. This project aims to explore how distributing the authority to launch critical tasks in the hands of multiple, rather than a single, nodes or users of the network can be an efficient means to avoid having a single point of failure and hence losing private data in its entirety in the case of a security breach. Furthermore, the proposed research studies how authority distribution is able to empower networks with the capability of coping with compromised devices or persons before they are identified as malicious and, most importantly, before they are able to do any harm.<br/><br/>The project investigates novel solutions beyond traditional threshold cryptography to address challenging roadblocks in authority distribution for data access and biometric authentication. Specifically, the project aims to overcome (i) privacy challenges with the use of biometrics, (ii) the need for costly resources as perfectly secure communication channels, (iii) a poor scaling behavior with the number of users, and (iv) the need for a central entity which is not compatible with distributed systems, to unravel fundamental trade-offs between privacy and storage requirements. The project comprises three interrelated thrusts. The first thrust studies the fundamental security and privacy guarantees that authority distribution can offer in the presence of, potentially unnoticed, compromised users or nodes. The second thrust investigates the construction of low-complexity coding schemes for authority distribution that operate at finite blocklengths, based on novel methods derived from error control coding and cryptography. The third thrust aims to enable a universal learning framework for authority distribution via deep learning that is independent of the data statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is working with ?upstream? Munsee Lunaape Elders and with ?downstream? disenfranchised communities, notably African American and pan-Latin American neighborhoods in Newark (and Greater Newark) to promote the values of equity and environmental justice. The Passaic River flows through Northern New Jersey and Southeastern New York State encompassing ten counties, and numerous urban and peri urban municipalities. This region was among the earliest US industrial centers, based on a combination of waterpower, water supply, estuarine ports, all adjacent to rapidly expanding New Yor City. Over time these activities resulted in pollution of the urban water supply and consequent shift of water supply to areas further upstream to areas within the basin.   As a result of this pollution, the Ramapough Turtle Clan settlement at Upper Ringwood has been twice-designated Superfund site.  2020 EPA studies have confirmed the ongoing danger.  Dangerous pollution within the basin, disinvestment, and decline of industry have left the PRB communities with high proportions of disadvantaged peoples living and working in toxic and vulnerable sites. In the Newark area, pollution sources include water pollutants of the entire Basin upstream impacting reservoirs. Downstream industrial pollutants include dioxin discharges from a facility making herbicides, used in making Agent Orange, and lead pipes.   The vision in this project is to enhance sustainability of the PRB and its environs through an inclusive approach that engages the disadvantaged communities and other stakeholders in PRB leading to remediation activities to restore the water quality and improve quality of life for the entire community.<br/> <br/>While the PRB upstream and downstream communities had little prior interconnection, they are interlinked by the area?s growing urban centers that depend on the Passaic River Basin for water supply. Aligning upstream and downstream communities will: a) develop a community of practice centered on equity; b) enable asset mapping of water system members; c) promote relationships of co-learning; and d) develop a participatory, sustainable, equity-led approach. It is this combination of shared interest in good water quality and addressing past exclusions that provide an opportunity for collaborative learning and shared development of approaches, notably interlinked via The Price Institute with the Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (SEBS), with their Cooperative Extension (NJAES). This planning grant will begin to cultivate a culture of stewardship among and between local communities and interests for the health and sustainability of the water system and ongoing connection to regional leaders. During implementation, historically marginalized communities will increase knowledge and application of water science, engagement, and public resource stewardship. More local research involvement for more data inputs and insights will also improve the accuracy, nuance, and understanding of the PRB.

Furthermore, the research results will provide guidelines to support policies as well as regulations to promote diversity and fairness in many relevant domains of application.<br/> <br/>The proposed research leverages recent advances in discrete and robust optimization, aiming for solution methodologies that faithfully address the exact learning models with fairness measures, provide strong out-of-sample fairness guarantees, are robust against bias and noisy outliers in the dataset, and can be solved efficiently for large-scale problem instances. More specifically, the proposed research aims to develop effective new frameworks for fair learning via sub-data selection that can leverage past efforts and enhance the fairness in the learning outcomes. Robust solution schemes will be carefully designed to significantly mitigate the severe overfitting effects of empirical-based methods and improve out-of-sample performance. Efforts will also be devoted to addressing algorithmic fairness in multi-stage decision-making and resource-allocation problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current protocols for continuously monitoring streamflows are based on approaches that fail to accurately capture the short-time effects of flood wave propagation and the seasonal impacts of changes to stream bank vegetation. While decades of substantial advancements in instrumentation technologies have dramatically transformed our in-situ measurement capabilities, this progress has not been mirrored by advancements in streamflow monitoring protocols. The outcomes of the proposed research will fill this gap by offering critical support for water science and management and by adding reliability to predictive models used to issue flood warnings required to protect communities and critical infrastructures. Increasing the accuracy of streamflow measurements in real time and improving the reliability of forecast models will have direct positive impacts on the wellbeing and safety of the public at a time when flooding continues to be a major threat to communities. The research outcomes will include rapid tools derived with artificial intelligence techniques that supplement existing forecasting capabilities. <br/> <br/>The proposed research combines inferences from experimental, data-driven (i.e., machine learning) and physically-based numerical investigations to enable adoption of a reach-scale monitoring method (rather than cross-sectional) and real time tracking of changes to all flow variables induced by unsteady flows and riparian vegetation growth. A heterogeneous routing approach complemented by extensive data analysis will allow the extraction of interdependencies among flow variables produced by subtle features of the hysteretic behavior associated with the above-mentioned cyclical processes. Generalization of the inferences for a wide range of flow and site conditions will cost-effectively improve the protocols for predictive streamflow relationships using only in-situ acquired data, without making recourse to modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NSURP is a virtual research program, so accepted students will participate remotely (i.e., not at an institution in a wet lab setting) and be matched to one of many laboratories around the country. Although there is no travel required for this program, only full-time participation, modest housing and meal support will be offered. It is anticipated that all selected students, those from underrepresented groups, will be trained in this program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Given that this program focuses on microbiology and immunology, student training in these areas is of great national interest to workforce development. Further, this program will remain virtual for accessibility to those unable to travel in person, thus providing great benefit to marginalized individuals seeking careers in STEM fields. Assessment of the program will be done thru the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths.<br/><br/>NSURP focuses on all fields within microbiology (host-microbe, environmental microbiology, public health, etc.) and immunology (computational, innate, humoral, cancer). Due to the virtual and national participation, NSURP encompasses various departments around the country.

Different 2D materials can be assembled into a designer structure to realize new properties and novel phenomena such as superconductivity and magnetism. This project utilizes a special design of 2D structure to study how electronic interaction can influence the stability of these novel phenomena, such as superconductivity and magnetism, in the quantum regime. Studying these phenomena on the nanometer scale is central to the advancement of quantum science, which promises to reshape the nature of technological innovation and has profound influence on national security and global economic balance. By training graduate and undergraduate students in device fabrication on a nanometer scale and exposing them to cutting edge research in studying quantum phenomena, this research and outreach program inspires and educates future scientists and engineers who can take on the leadership role and pioneer innovations in the field of quantum computational technology. The outreach effort includes collaboration with the Sci-Toon team to produce cartoon videos to expose the general public to the research activities. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: <br/>Graphene moiré systems provides a fascinating material platform to study quantum phenomena, such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism, and investigate their interplay in a 2D confinement. This project utilizes specially designed 2D material heterostructure, which is usually referred to as the double-layer structure, to perform Coulomb screening and thermodynamic measurements on various moiré systems. A main objective is to understand the role of Coulomb correlation in stabilizing the superconducting and ferromagnetic phases. The role of Coulomb interaction offers important constraints to understand the pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry of the superconducting phase, which has become an outstanding open question. This project also explores a new flavor of moiré physics using the proximity effect, which are shown to transform the ground state order of 2D moiré systems. By controlling the strength of Coulomb interaction through screening, the proposed effort directly studies the influence of the proximity effect and aims to establish a new method to engineer physical properties of 2D material structures.

Surprisingly, this characterization yields answers to longstanding problems in mathematical physics and operator algebras. Motivated by this, this project aims to explore the fascinating connections between complexity theory, quantum information, and pure mathematics. The overarching theme is to investigate how classical users can test and characterize complex quantum objects, with applications ranging from cryptography to operator algebras. These investigations will spur interdisciplinary research across computer science, physics, and mathematics. In addition to leading the research, the PI will disseminate this subject matter to a wide variety of communities (both academic and industrial). The PI will also participate in outreach and education activities, both in-person and online, to promote interest in quantum information science in high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will pursue three main directions. First, the PI will develop novel protocols that allow a classical user to verify complex quantum entanglement in untrusted quantum devices, with applications to entanglement theory and testing of noisy quantum computers. Second, the PI will further develop the techniques used in the proof of MIP* = RE to address unsolved questions in mathematics related to the resolutions of Tsirelson?s problem and Connes? embedding problem.

Methods for mapping the atomic structure of molecules are diverse, yet recent advancements have inspired innovative techniques making more complex structural studies possible. This fellowship will enable training in a rapidly developing cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) method called microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). MicroED maps molecules using the same diffraction phenomena as X-ray crystallography. However, MicroED employs electrons which permits data collection on crystals about a billionth of the size needed for X-ray diffraction. Using such vanishingly small crystals helps address a common obstacle of small molecule and macromolecular X-ray crystallography?achieving sizable single crystalline materials. This feature will motivate further refinement of MicroED methods, and the technique will ultimately become a common option for structure elucidation studies. The training will be reinforced by the curation of education materials that will benefit future generations of structural scientists and promote the value of this emerging technique.<br/> <br/>The primary objective of this proposal is for the PI to acquire the ability to lead and conduct MicroED experiments to elucidate molecular structures. Through remote learning and collaborative visits to the National Center for CryoEM Access and Training (NCCAT), the PI and two trainees will obtain comprehensive instruction on the entire process of MicroED analysis from fundamental theoretical aspects through to data presentation. The project will be research driven, focusing on both halogen bonding oligomers and the resistance to inhibitors of Cholinesterase 8A (RIC-8A) protein. The small molecule and macromolecular studies reflect the diversity of MicroED studies and will ensure that a diverse range of researchers may take advantage of the PI?s new MicroED skillset. The results and educational materials will be disseminated though outreach, publications, and workshops, exposing the technique to audiences of varied expertise. The PI will ultimately provide MicroED services, enhancing the research efforts of structural scientists at the University of Montana and surrounding EPSCoR institutions for years to come.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However the data being analyzed and the computers being used are both becoming so diverse and irregular that it is much harder to deliver efficient software. To drive innovation in both data analytics and hardware development, computer systems are needed that take advantage of the structure and sparsity of the data and the capabilities of new hardware. However, taking advantage of these properties and capabilities with current approaches makes the software a lot more complicated. The project's novelties are the development of a software system that automatically specializes itself to combine diverse and irregular data sources and to target diverse hardware. The project's impacts are a 10x-100x performance improvement across a large class of irregular data analytics computations, including sparse tensor algebra, sparse array operations, and relational algebra. Even greater performance improvements will be possible by taking advantage of emerging specialized hardware. <br/><br/>The project explores new programming language constructs and a new unified compiler system for sparse tensor algebra, sparse array operations (e.g., sparse NumPy), and relational algebra. The unified compiler combines three separate languages that describe respectively the application logic (e.g., a relational query followed by sparse array operations), the data representations (e.g., relational tries and sparse arrays stored in compressed form), and the organization of the computation (e.g., to target a GPU equipped with specialized tensor processing hardware). To achieve these goals, the project will develop a unified compiler theory for sparse array operations and relational algebra, develop new data representations for relations, and develop techniques to compile these applications to specialized accelerators. Success of this project will lead to new flexible data analytics systems that port across both data structures and hardware and that are orders of magnitude faster than current general approaches without loss of generality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such variation can have large implications for marine biogeochemistry and atmospheric CO_2 levels. As such, future variations in ocean community C:N:P could be a key feedback to global change. The elemental composition of particulate organic matter (POM) represents the aggregate value of diverse microorganisms as well as non-living particles. However, we currently do not understand how individual cells and particles contribute to observed variation in the C:N:P of POM. This project is determining the biomass C:N:P of individual microbial cells grown under a range of conditions and sampled from diverse ocean biomes. Because different individuals are likely to have different fates (e.g., loss to sinking, lysis, predation), understanding how the trait distribution of microbial biomass C:N:P relates to cell size and trophic mode and how environmental conditions affect each trait?s distribution offers new perspectives and insight into marine C, N, and P cycles.  This project supports two PhD students and multiple undergraduate students.  The PhD students are integrated into existing networks on microbiome science at each institution with opportunities to collaborate across diverse disciplines. Undergraduate students at both institutions are being recruited through existing training programs that target underrepresented groups. In addition, PI Hall is part of a collaborative of Ecologists and Poets at CSU, that look at ways to translate ecological relationships to non-traditional media to make it more accessible and impactful to the general public. This group is exploring the nature of individuality within the marine microbiome by creating trait distributions of written text and removing different modes of individuals (e.g., words) to better understand and communicate how individuals from the smallest organisms on the planet (marine microorganisms) can have large effects on the surrounding ecosystem (i.e., the planet). Results from this project are being incorporated into future projects of the working group at Colorado State University including public presentations, art installations, and published materials. <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to quantify the relationship between environmental conditions and marine microbial C:N:P by assessing the individuality in microbial elemental stoichiometry. To achieve this the project uses energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to assess the stoichiometric trait distribution of populations and communities under different resource and temperature treatments and oceanographic field work across a broad latitudinal gradient. The researchers hypothesize that the relationship between the stoichiometry of particulate organic matter (POM) and environmental conditions are masked by distinct responses of individual constituents of the marine microbiome. They hypothesize that these distinct responses result in a multi-modal distribution of particulate carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) of the marine microbiome. The investigators are characterizing the distribution of three stoichiometric traits (biomass C:N, C:P, and N:P) for 50 marine isolates (both autotrophs and heterotrophs) under different resource and temperature environments. They are characterizing the same trait distribution for marine communities sampled from different regions of the ocean for the same resource and temperature environments as the population experiments. They are participating on an ocean going cruise to characterize stoichiometric trait distribution of the marine microbiome across natural gradients of resources and temperature. Understanding how constituent members of microbial communities alter their biomass in response to environmental change is providing a missing link between the variation in the ocean?s environment and particulate C:N:P ratios for diverse marine environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using this database, the team has shown that while individual engineering programs may have poor graduation rates, that a multi-institutional view reveals that engineering programs as a whole graduate a larger fraction of students than other groups of disciplines. The team has also shown that women and men have similar graduation rates in engineering, likely a result of efforts to make engineering education a welcoming environment for women and the high academic credentials of the women who do study engineering. As with the overall graduation rate, individual institutions and programs can and do have worse outcomes. A comprehensive study of student pathways in various engineering disciplines provided practitioners with rich information specific to their disciplinary context. The team has also designed a variety of metrics that have provided researchers and practitioners with an improved understanding of student pathways. The quality of the data source and the research team is attested by these substantial findings, multiple best paper awards, and other recognitions. Following efforts to solicit data from additional institutions and create opportunities for other researchers to use the database, this project will make the data more accessible to a wider range of researchers while making it easier to recruit new institutional partners. Making the data available to a wider range of researchers in different disciplines will use result in a larger range of research results more quickly using different approaches. <br/><br/>This project will transition this useful dataset to ASEE, the American Society for Engineering Education, and allow ASEE to build the technical infrastructure to maintain the data collection after the transition. ASEE has a mechanism for collecting institutional data (though with less detail) and a mechanism for charging for access to the data they collect. ASEE does not compete with alternative data providers because ASEE is not an academic institution, which will make it easier to solicit new data to expand this resource. The project will support ASEE in building a new data schema to collect and store this richer dataset as well as build a range of tools to make it easier for practitioners and researchers to view aspects of the data through dashboards. During the term of the project, ASEE will also transfer all legal agreements with the institutional partners. The current team of researchers using the database will support this effort as a liaison to provide an interface with institutional partners. To support a growing community of researchers in using the database, the research team will also deliver workshops to help educate people about the database and how to use it effectively. The research team will also continue to develop software tools that can be used by other researchers and practitioners to work with the database. Archiving and maintaining the data collection at ASEE ensures that the current dataset will be preserved, that it will grow to include a larger and more diverse set of institutions, and that the dataset will be more accessible, which will ensure that these insights are able to continue and, through ASEE?s national platform, influence multiple national stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A small number of very large fires have become extremely high-intensity infernos and have been causing the majority of the damage. However, the understanding of the physical processes governing wildland fire behavior has remained limited. Although some research progress has been made in understanding how fires spread on grasslands, several aspects of fire behavior in forested environments are still not well understood. Under certain circumstances, surface fires occurring on a forest floor can ascend vertically and damage the forest canopy. Moreover, if the conditions are favorable, the fire can spread horizontally tree-to-tree across the canopy, becoming a much higher intensity crown fire. Understanding the physical and dynamic meteorology of wildland fires is consequently of utmost importance and necessary to develop mitigation strategies such as prescribed burns and effective fuel management practices such as forest thinning. To assess the effectiveness of such management efforts, it is, therefore, crucial to understand wildland fire behavior inside the forest canopy environment. This project will characterize the mechanisms of turbulent wind flow in the forest canopy during wildland fire events, which will result in (i) advances in fire behavior modeling, (ii) developing decision support tools for fuel treatments and prescribed fires, and (iii) improved models of air quality impacts from wildland fires. Moreover, the project will train a cohort of early-career scientists and students in the fundamentals of wildfire science.<br/><br/>In a vegetated environment, the fire occurs below the forest canopy, which means that canopy-induced turbulent eddies interact with the fire and the fire-atmosphere interaction is modulated by the fundamental nature of canopy turbulence. The forest canopy acts as an extended sink of momentum for the air above, thereby imposing a range of length and velocity scales. Moreover, the presence of shear-induced instabilities at the canopy-atmosphere interface results in intermittent coherent structures that penetrate the sub-canopy airspace and aid in canopy-atmosphere interaction. The physics of turbulent flow in vegetated canopies itself is an active area of research to date. Standard atmospheric boundary layer formulations are inadequate in explaining canopy-atmosphere exchange of mass, momentum, and energy. This is rendered further complicated by the presence of the fire, which generates additional shear and buoyancy-induced motions. Using lab and field experimental datasets, this project will explore the following questions: (i) how do the coherent structures imposed by the canopy influence the convective and radiative regimes that regulate fire spread? (ii) how do the unique nature of turbulent transport and turbulent diffusivity in the canopy impact the redistribution of turbulent energy during wildfires? and (iii) how does the intermittent nature of canopy turbulence impact bursting motions associated with fire spread? This project will alter the current fuel-centric perspective, where the vegetation appears as mere fuel to be consumed by the flames, to a new paradigm, where the canopy itself actively modulates the wind and the fire through interactions spanning multiple scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The software and associated design problems will be pilot tested by students at thirteen institutions, including community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, liberal arts colleges, and public universities.  Information from these pilots will be used iteratively to refine the software and teaching approach.  This project represents a novel application of artificial intelligence to engineering that could augment the creativity and productivity of the engineering workforce of the future.  <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to facilitate the teaching and learning of generative design at the undergraduate level.  To accomplish this goal, the University of Arkansas, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Oregon State University, and the Concord Consortium will collaborate to define, implement, and disseminate generative design tools and projects for use in undergraduate courses.  Research questions from three perspectives will drive the project: 1) Theoretical perspective: What are the essential elements of generative design thinking that students must acquire so they can work effectively at the human-technology frontier in engineering? 2) Practical perspective: To what extent and in what ways can the curriculum and materials support the learning of generative design as indicated by students' gains in generative design thinking? and 3) Affective perspective: To what extent and in what ways can artificial intelligence affect the professional formation of engineers as indicated by the changes of students' interest and self-efficacy in engineering?  To answer these questions, interdisciplinary research that integrates the perspectives and knowledge in engineering design, computer science, learning science, and workforce development will be conducted.  The project will involve more than 1,000 students at 13 institutions around the country.   The research will include data from demographic surveys, questionnaires, self-efficacy measures, design reports, screencast videos, classroom observations, and participant interviews.  The materials developed by the project will be open source, including an open-source tool for teaching and learning generative design and a set of project-based learning modules that guide use of the tool to solve authentic design problems in architectural engineering and energy engineering.  The products of this project are expected to equip students with essential skills and mindsets needed to master using artificial intelligence approaches in contemporary engineering practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to the high strength-to-density ratio of Mg, replacing those conventional structural metals in the automotive and aerospace industries with Mg alloys not only improves the nation?s energy efficiency, but also reduces the emission of greenhouse gases. However, Mg and its alloys tend to break easily upon deformation, which has seriously limited the market penetration of Mg. Unfortunately, the mechanism of deformation, particularly at the atomic level, has remained elusive, which has hampered the development of effective strategies to control the deformation behaviors and properties of Mg alloys. This project aims to investigate the mechanisms of Mg deformation and then develop a reliable multiscale model that integrates those mechanisms; this model can then be used to predict the deformation behaviors of Mg and its alloys. The proposed research will have a profound societal impact by accelerating the development of lightweight and ductile Mg alloys to replace conventional steels and aluminum alloys in the automotive and aerospace industries. This project will also lead to innovative K-12 education on metals and deformation behaviors at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), including lab tours, science demos, and engineering games for K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/>Deformation of Mg is mostly governed by dislocation slips and twinning at the atomic scale. However, how twinning initiates, evolves, and interacts with other twinning modes or dislocations has so far remained elusive. Thus, the overarching goal of this project is to develop high-fidelity multiscale deformation models to describe and predict the deformation behaviors of Mg and its alloys that will guide the development of more ductile Mg alloys for the automotive and aerospace industries. This demands a deeper understanding and improved modeling of deformation mechanisms at both the atomic scale and the mesoscopic scale and, furthermore, achieve a coherent connection between the two scales via multiscale models. To achieve this goal, two integrated research objectives will be pursued: 1) establish the atomic-level nucleation conditions of twinning and dislocation using state-of-the-art, first-principles calculations and deep neural network-based molecular dynamics simulations; and 2) implement those atomic-level deformation mechanisms in continuum-level crystal plasticity modeling to validate against experimental data. The successful completion of this project will advance the state of knowledge of deformation twinning in Mg and enable high-fidelity deformation modeling of Mg, which can accelerate research and development of Mg alloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, educators need tools for developing empathy in engineers. Yet, measuring empathy is challenging because it manifests uniquely in different contexts. To begin addressing the need for an engineering-specific measure of empathy, we developed and pilot-tested an assessment instrument. Our prior work suggested a need to improve how empathy is measured across all aspects of the design phases and to account for variation in empathy for distinct user groups. Thus, in this study, our primary objective is to refine this instrument and to ensure its validity, reliability, and fairness for assessing empathic formation in undergraduate engineering design across multiple contexts, design phases, and participants. We will integrate and account for these perspectives in the expansion of the instrument, thus ensuring that the instrument captures a diverse group of instructor perspectives and needs. Thus, this study will support a critical need for a valid tool for assessing empathy in engineering design.<br/><br/>Empathy can provide the ?spark of human concern for others,? thus bolstering efforts at integrating empathy into engineering curriculum and help students? empathic growth with and for users. Thus, a measure of empathy can help students care, understand, and help users in need. In this study, we will iterate on an instrument for assessing empathy with a diverse group of engineering design instructors to identify potential refinements of the instrument needed to improve its alignment with their contexts, collect student data to ensure potential instrument refinements that accurately represent student experiences, and design a revised instrument that accounts for these novel insights. We will test the revised instrument for validity via the triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data with a large sample of students. Finally, we will use the instrument to identify differences in empathic formation associated with various instructional design contexts and practices, thus generating new knowledge on best practices for promoting empathic formation in engineering design. Our team brings prior research in empathic design, distinct engineering backgrounds, and expertise in multiple research methodologies which will ensure research rigor and quality. Our collaborators are design educators and thus will help ensure the instrument is useful for engineering design courses across disciplines and across university sites. The advisory board includes experts in empathy, design, and psychometrics who will provide external evaluation and guidance to ensure that the instrument represents the state of the art of research on empathy in engineering design. By providing the community with this measure, we can facilitate the integration of empathy and assessment of empathy in engineering classroom contexts, which can positively impact the experience and retention of pro-socially motivated students in engineering programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional sintering typically requires a large input of energy, significant equipment costs, and relatively long manufacturing times.  Application of electric fields during sintering can greatly reduce these costs and processing times. Unfortunately, electric field effects remain poorly understood owing in large part to (1) the great geometrical complexity of sintering and (2) a poor understanding of atomic motion and bonding at crystal surfaces where powder bonds during sintering. The lack of scientific understanding impairs engineers' ability to design optimal manufacturing conditions and produce new materials. This project develops a new methodology that efficiently isolates the physical properties of the material from particle geometry effects. As a result, unprecedented information about how electric fields affect bonding and atomic motion on surfaces can be obtained. This information can define which parameters are most important during electric field assisted sintering, and as a result, strategies to optimize manufacturing conditions. The work is technologically relevant to development of new ultrahigh temperature aerospace materials, advanced optical ceramics, and ceramics in microelectronics.  The project supports the training of a graduate student in materials science and engineering. Graduates then typically work in industrial research laboratories in large manufacturing firms. The project also provides research opportunities for underrepresented high school students and pre-service teachers, and outreach activities targeted towards K-12 students. These activities are intended to attract students to science and engineering careers.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Electric fields can dramatically accelerate sintering kinetics, as is often observed during spark plasma sintering or flash sintering. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain highly controversial and poorly understood. The lack of fundamental knowledge derives from the complexity of the sintering process and the coupling of the electric field to all relevant diffusional and thermodynamic coefficients. The experiments isolate these effects by (1) measuring electrocapillarity coefficients of grain boundaries and surfaces in zirconia using a nanoscale zero creep experiment in applied fields, (2) quantifying electric field dependent grain boundary and surface diffusion coefficients via nanoscale single grain boundary Coble creep and surface smoothing experiments, respectively, and (3) controlling for anisotropy by using representative low and high energy bicrystal geometries. The work emerges from the development of novel ultra-high temperature in situ transmission electron microscopy based nanomechanical testing methods. The transformational impacts on the discipline are a new mechanistic understanding of electric field effects on sintering, new insights into field dependent interface thermodynamics in oxides, and the development of novel experimental methodologies useful for addressing many problems in ceramic science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MHK systems could contribute significantly to a diversified energy economy, improving the nation?s energy security and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. However, these systems generate power from puissant resources, such as strong water currents and/or large waves, which impose physical stresses on the equipment that are several times greater than wind turbines of similar power ratings. These constraints lead to stringent design requirements that increase capital costs. Further, operation and maintenance costs are high because access to equipment is limited due to their offshore geographical location and harsh corrosive environments. This research project will provide the theoretical and computational foundation to enhance MHK systems? maintainability, survivability, and efficiency. The long-term goal of this project is to transform the conventional MHK turbine design process from a sequential approach, where subsystems are designed individually and strong coupling among them is neglected, generally leading to a suboptimal design, to a novel co-design framework that simultaneously accounts for control, reliability and operational expenditure of the overall MHK system with coupled subsystems. This simultaneous co-design at the earliest stage allows for mutually beneficial subsystems and could significantly improve the overall system performance. This project will thus improve energy systems and accelerate progress in the blue economy. Results will be disseminated in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Lab and industry partners, as well as through open-source tools, accelerating technology transfer. Outcomes will be integrated into new research-intensive curricula and a new energy resiliency certificate, and opportunities will be provided to students from groups underrepresented in STEM to participate in marine renewable energy research.<br/><br/>This research project aims to develop efficient and robust prognostics (prediction of the remaining useful life) and diagnostics (fault detection and identification) tools of MHK turbines, for the goal of establishing a unified design framework that accounts for control, reliability, and operational expenditure of MHK systems. The project will explore a spectrum of tools from domain mechanistic models to deep learning. The research activities will integrate domain-specific physics knowledge and multi-source data in a synergistic manner. Specifically, the project will address the following three research challenges. (1) The data scarcity challenge: there are not enough data to train an effective prognostics/diagnostics model for MHK because the industry is new. This project will develop a novel physics-reinforced knowledge transfer learning approach for designing efficient models that uses wind big data as the source domain, constrained by the physics in MHK as the target domain. (2) The data quality and concept drift challenge: system dynamics may change over time and sensor data are subject to failures because MHK devices are to be deployed in harsh, remote areas for long-term operation. This project will develop a novel graph and reinforcement learning approach for designing robust models using both sensor network structure information and stream pattern of multi-sensor time series. (3) The heterogeneous, multi-directional couplings and co-optimization challenge: turbine geometry, control, reliability, and maintenance strategies should be designed simultaneously to optimize MHK turbine performance. This project will build responsive surface models, that represent the relationships between design parameters and performance index, based on both experimental data and dynamical simulations. White-box co-optimization tools based on deep neural decision trees will be developed to optimize the turbine design parameters. Taken together, results from this research will establish a solid foundation for robust predictive monitoring and co-design of complex large-scale dynamic systems, such as onshore and floating offshore wind farms, connected vehicles, and intelligent structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The growth of solar photovoltaic energy has highlighted the increasing problem of competing land use, scarcity, and cost. Floating photovoltaics have emerged as a solution to this problem; deploying solar modules on existing bodies of water lessens the need for land-based installations. However, the high cost has inhibited growth of this renewable energy source.  This project advances a new system that is lighter and cheaper. Furthermore, the modules are fabricated with non-toxic and environmentally friendly materials, mitigating the risk posed by other novel photovoltaic technologies of contaminating the bodies of water. <br/><br/>The proposed project advances lower cost lightweight alternatives for solar photovoltaic generation.

In contrast to dyes and pigments, structural colors do not absorb light but instead reflect it from a microscopically structured surface. The wavelengths of reflected light depending on the orientation of the object and the viewing angle, causing the shimmery, color-shifting effect of iridescence. This structural color can be also produced by assembling spherical particles (200-500 nm) into close-packed crystals on surfaces. The local ordering of the particles within a colloidal crystal is governed by the interaction between particles, and their particle packing efficiency. While most of the currently available experimental studies aim at maximizing the size of colloidal crystals, there is a significant knowledge gap in understanding the factors governing local order and its impact on structural color. This lack of understanding exists due to a complex interplay between the experimental parameters used in the assembly process and the corresponding structure obtained. Understanding the relationship between the crystal order of colloidal particles and the experimental processing parameters is the focus of the current proposal. This proposal will investigate the impact of the local assembly formed by spherical nanoparticles upon the addition of rod-shaped particles, and their corresponding on the brilliance of structural color. The project will outline a general strategy for synthesizing surface coatings with never fading colors, which is not the case for dye or pigment-based paints.<br/><br/>The majority of currently used materials are the ground state, equilibrium phases of the assembled nanoparticles, which have well-defined properties but are bound by the limits of thermodynamics. To push the limits of material design and encode unusual properties in the mesoscopic materials, we need to look beyond the conventional equilibrium materials into the domain of non-equilibrium assemblies of non-spherical particles. Currently, there is a significant lack of understanding of principles governing the formation of assemblies of non-spherical colloids, and even less is known about their structure-property-function relationships. This knowledge gap exists due to the inherent complexity of the interparticle interactions involved in the assembly of non-spherical particles, corresponding dynamics, and control parameters. This proposal aims at understanding these aspects using rods and spheres as model nanoparticles. The proposal will address the following fundamental questions: (a) How do non-spherical particles interact? and which factors influence the interparticle interactions? (b) What is the effect of the presence of non-spherical particles on the crystallization of spherical nanoparticles? (c) How does the change in local crystalline order affect the optical properties of the assembled material? These questions will be addressed by performing systematic experiments on gold nanorods and nanospheres and following their assembly dynamics/kinetics using liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (at Pacific Northwestern National Laboratory) and x-ray/light scattering (at Louisiana State University). Additionally, theoretical models will be developed which will provide a better understanding of the surface forces driving the assembly and assist in developing processing routes to synthesize nanoscale coatings of tunable properties such as structural color.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The size of an earthquake and the propensity of an earthquake to create large dangerous tsunamis is determined by variations in the plate interface coupling which creates locked and unlocked regions of the fault. Understanding these variations in plate coupling is critical to understanding these dangerous earthquakes. Strain is released along some offshore parts of fault interfaces in occasional slow slip events (SSEs) where the fault moves much as with a normal earthquake, but the stored energy is released so slowly that these events are barely or not detectable on land.  Regions between the SSE regions may remain locked, producing the potential for large tsunamigenic earthquakes. There is some evidence that SSEs on one part of a plate interface may increase strain on adjacent parts, triggering large earthquakes. Seafloor pressure gauges can detect SSEs as the seafloor moves upward during a SSE, decreasing the depth of the gauge. A SSE was detected and mapped in the proposed study region offshore New Zealand in 2015 using pressure gauges, as this is currently the only feasible method appropriate for wide application offshore.  Those observations were greatly limited by the effects of oceanographic noise from ocean eddies. A much larger experiment is now planned for the same region. By adding oceanographic observations of near-seafloor current and vertical echo sounder data, the research should show this noise source can be much reduced and therefore reveal the spatial and temporal extent of offshore SSEs in greater detail and with better accuracy, improving our understanding of plate coupling relevant to understanding great earthquakes. The project will train a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher and involve them in a large international experiment. <br/><br/>During this large collaborative experiment with New Zealand and Japanese scientists, a large array of ocean bottom geodetic, oceanographic, and seismological instruments will be deployed for two years offshore of the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, where one or more shallow SSEs are expected to occur during the deployment.  The joint array would include 44 seafloor absolute pressure gauges (APGs) and 12 current meters and upward looking sonars to test and develop innovative methods to remove contaminating pressure variations that arise within the water column (labeled oceanographic noise). The reduced-noise seafloor data will enable more accurate description of the spatio-temporal evolution of offshore slow-slip events (SSEs). For the first time, an array of 11 APG sensors equipped with a system for removing long term drift from sensor data will be deployed, with potential long term benefit for oceanographic observations and for applying seafloor vertical geodesy at tectonic strain rates. Data from 21 ocean bottom seismometers in the combined array will be used to probe the relationship between earthquakes and tremor and seafloor SSEs. These observations will advance our understanding of offshore variations in plate coupling in subduction zones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genes in bacteria are not only inherited from parent to offspring but can also transfer between different species. This ?horizontal gene transfer? is often caused by small genetic elements called conjugative plasmids. These plasmids carry the machinery to move copies of themselves into new bacterial cells. A gene on one of these plasmids can inhabit very different host cells over time. A mutation in this gene may then have different effects in each host. This means genes could evolve differently during parent offspring transmission than when they are transferred horizontally between species. This project combines mathematical models and experiments with different bacterial species to measure the effect of horizontal transfer on the evolution of an antibiotic resistance gene and determine how that influences adaptation to changing conditions.  Because antibiotic resistance genes are often located on these plasmids, this will aid in combating the evolution of drug resistance. Additional broader impacts include the development of learning tools and a new undergraduate course that will provide authentic research experiences for students. <br/><br/>This project has three research aims. First, the researchers will propagate communities with combinations of three bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and monitor the evolution of a plasmid-borne gene coding for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Horizontal gene transfer will be manipulated during this process to determine the role of transfer between species in evolution of drug resistance. Second, genetically engineered bacteria will be used to determine why certain mutational sets are favored during horizontal transfer. Mathematically modeling of the results will produce predictions about whether horizontal transfer speeds or hinders the evolution of drug resistance. Third, the researchers will build a computational model to incorporate more realistic features of microbial communities, including more complex environments, migration, and competition between different bacterial species.

However, its mechanism remains poorly understood due to limited characterization. The purpose of the research is to identify what occurs at the early stage of nucleation of salt solutions. The proposed work will overcome the current barriers using innovative experimental apparatus enabled by the fellowship. The results of this project will advance the current knowledge on what occurs in the early stage of nucleation, which will lead to a better understanding of the nucleation mechanism of salt solutions. The fellowship project will result in new multidisciplinary collaborations among Iowa State University, the University of Iowa, Ames Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. One doctoral student will acquire skills in molecular dynamics simulation and gain extensive hands-on experience. Two undergraduate students from the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) will join the project and present their work at the SHPE National Convention. Three existing outreach programs at Iowa State University will be leveraged to share the fellowship project with K-12 students, teachers, and parents. <br/><br/>A growing number of materials, including proteins, electrolyte solutions, biominerals, and colloids, have been observed to nucleate in multistep forming pre-nucleation clusters (PNCs) prior to nucleation. It is apparent that PNCs play a critically important role in multistep nucleation (MSN), yet their nature is poorly understood. The rationale for the proposed research is that a mechanistic understanding of MSN is likely to provide new opportunities to develop a method to control the nucleation and growth of desired crystal phases. For this reason, the project aims to identify the structure, thermodynamic stability, and role of PNCs in an aqueous NaCl solution. The PI team will overcome the current experimental obstacles by integrating the solution electrostatic levitator (SEL) developed by the PI team with neutron scattering at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The long-term goal of the project is to develop a predictive framework to anticipate and control the MSN in various aqueous solutions. The proposed research will lead to a vertical-step advancement towards elucidating the mechanism of MSN in electrolyte solutions and would give deeper insights to better understand the MSN in other material systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meanwhile, depressive or anxiety symptoms, often associated with elevated cortisol (the ?stress hormone?), can lead to the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Monitoring both glucose and cortisol levels regularly in a cost-effective and effortless way is highly desired to manage diabetes and stress, and prevent prediabetes from progressing to full-blown T2D. Enzyme-based glucose sensors monopolize the current glucose monitor industry, and the traditional detection of cortisol is carried out in centralized laboratory settings based on immunoassays using antibodies and enzymes. Natural receptors such as enzymes and antibodies often suffer from high cost, poor stability, and complexity. This project aims to develop an enzyme-free and antibody-free electrochemical sensor to simultaneously detect glucose and cortisol coupled with machine learning techniques. The knowledge gained from this research will lead to low-cost biosensing devices and manufacturing processes that will not only increase access to decentralized, personalized, and preventive healthcare but may also be applied to other chemicals, biomarkers, and pathogens detection. This project will contribute significantly to workforce training by promoting the interdisciplinary research of sensing, computing, and machine learning-based data analytics. <br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term research goal is to develop a low-cost, easy-to-manufacture and high-performance biosensing technology based on electropolymerized MIPs (e-MIPs) as the platform to detect biomarkers in human biofluids for decentralized diagnostics and personal health monitoring.  Towards this goal, the aim of this ERI project is to pilot an in-situ fabrication procedure to construct an enzyme-free and e-MIPs-based electrochemical sensor to simultaneously detect glucose and cortisol with high sensitivity and selectivity.  The proposed sensor consists of metal/metal oxide (M/MO) nanostructures to mimic enzymes? catalytic activity for glucose oxidation and a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) to mimic antibodies? selective biomolecular recognition for glucose and cortisol. The project will explore a fully in-situ fabrication procedure to synthesize and integrate functional nanomaterials with MIPs directly on the electrode?s surface. This process is fast, facile, and highly reproducible, and the sensor is immediately ready for use without further processing. The proposed sensor is designed to provide distinct dual signals correlated with cortisol and glucose concentrations, which can be quantified simultaneously by a well-configured machine learning model. The novel dual-sensing mechanism will establish a new path to enable multiplex detection leveraging upon the powerful inference capability of machine learning. This project will also deliver an in-depth understanding of the critical factors that impact the sensing performance, which will provide valuable guidelines for future MIPs design for biosensors. Low cost and high performance of MIPs, facile fabrication process, microfluidic-integration readiness, and multiplex detection capability all together will lead to cost-effective biosensors and biodevices not only for Point-of-Care (POC) diagnosis and personal health monitoring but also for other applications such as smart agriculture, water quality, and food safety monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such variation can have large implications for marine biogeochemistry and atmospheric CO_2 levels. As such, future variations in ocean community C:N:P could be a key feedback to global change. The elemental composition of particulate organic matter (POM) represents the aggregate value of diverse microorganisms as well as non-living particles. However, we currently do not understand how individual cells and particles contribute to observed variation in the C:N:P of POM. This project is determining the biomass C:N:P of individual microbial cells grown under a range of conditions and sampled from diverse ocean biomes. Because different individuals are likely to have different fates (e.g., loss to sinking, lysis, predation), understanding how the trait distribution of microbial biomass C:N:P relates to cell size and trophic mode and how environmental conditions affect each trait?s distribution offers new perspectives and insight into marine C, N, and P cycles.  This project supports two PhD students and multiple undergraduate students.  The PhD students are integrated into existing networks on microbiome science at each institution with opportunities to collaborate across diverse disciplines. Undergraduate students at both institutions are being recruited through existing training programs that target underrepresented groups. In addition, PI Hall is part of a collaborative of Ecologists and Poets at CSU, that look at ways to translate ecological relationships to non-traditional media to make it more accessible and impactful to the general public. This group is exploring the nature of individuality within the marine microbiome by creating trait distributions of written text and removing different modes of individuals (e.g., words) to better understand and communicate how individuals from the smallest organisms on the planet (marine microorganisms) can have large effects on the surrounding ecosystem (i.e., the planet). Results from this project are being incorporated into future projects of the working group at Colorado State University including public presentations, art installations, and published materials. <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to quantify the relationship between environmental conditions and marine microbial C:N:P by assessing the individuality in microbial elemental stoichiometry. To achieve this the project uses energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to assess the stoichiometric trait distribution of populations and communities under different resource and temperature treatments and oceanographic field work across a broad latitudinal gradient. The researchers hypothesize that the relationship between the stoichiometry of particulate organic matter (POM) and environmental conditions are masked by distinct responses of individual constituents of the marine microbiome. They hypothesize that these distinct responses result in a multi-modal distribution of particulate carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) of the marine microbiome. The investigators are characterizing the distribution of three stoichiometric traits (biomass C:N, C:P, and N:P) for 50 marine isolates (both autotrophs and heterotrophs) under different resource and temperature environments. They are characterizing the same trait distribution for marine communities sampled from different regions of the ocean for the same resource and temperature environments as the population experiments. They are participating on an ocean going cruise to characterize stoichiometric trait distribution of the marine microbiome across natural gradients of resources and temperature. Understanding how constituent members of microbial communities alter their biomass in response to environmental change is providing a missing link between the variation in the ocean?s environment and particulate C:N:P ratios for diverse marine environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This demand will need to be met with increased efficiency of power systems. Because this efficiency is tied to losses associated with the semiconductor devices used in power electronics, the replacement of today?s silicon-based components with a novel semiconductor technology must be investigated. Wide bandgap semiconductors are candidates, however ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors represent the next frontier. In particular, aluminum-rich aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) offers an exciting opportunity to explore a new generation of highly efficient and robust electronic devices. The robustness of these devices in the face of elevated temperatures or electromagnetic interference (EMI) also stands to improve system performance and reliability. Thus far, a combination of unresolved scientific questions and technological barriers have prevented AlGaN devices from reaching their full potential. The recent commercialization of aluminum nitride (AlN) wafers, however, permits the ideal properties of AlGaN films to be studied for the first time. Thus, the research objective of this CAREER project is to understand the operational physics of high voltage AlGaN devices and develop engineering solutions that will unlock their performance for power electronics where efficiency and robustness are key. The investigator is also committed to becoming a leading educator in the area of semiconductor devices via the use of team-based, laboratory-based methods and is passionate about ensuring equal access to STEM education/training. Three education/outreach tasks have been defined with the objectives of: (1) equipping undergraduates with marketable skills via hands-on research experiences that they can leverage for STEM careers, (2) engaging a broad range of groups to increase the STEM workforce, and (3) increasing the public?s scientific literacy surrounding semiconductors/electronics.<br/><br/>The objective of this CAREER project is to understand the performance limits of ultra-wide bandgap AlGaN-based power devices and establish solutions to deploy these devices in highly efficient and robust systems. The potential for Al-rich AlGaN to support large electric fields will be understood by experimentally extracting the impact ionization coefficients from avalanche photodiodes realized on native AlN substrates. The results will be used to minimize the drift region?s contribution to the overall conduction loss. Since low resistance ohmic contacts to Al-rich AlGaN remain elusive, the surfaces and bulk of UWBG AlGaN will be engineered to obtain thermally stable contacts with reduced contact resistance. The surface barrier height will be reduced using both ex-situ and in-situ interlayers that compensate AlGaN?s polarization charge. Tunneling contacts will also be sought by heavily doping the bulk AlGaN via Si implantation followed by effective activation annealing. The limits of high temperature operation will be explored. Next, p-type doping of AlGaN, in particular for buried and lateral regions, is a barrier towards advanced power devices. Thus, novel Crystal Heterogeneous Integration (CHI) will be investigated to combine p-type compound semiconductors with n-type AlGaN. The high voltage breakdown of heterogeneous PN junctions will be evaluated, as well as their response to light to interpret the resulting band structures and explore carrier transport across the junction. These research tasks will be leveraged to design, fabricate, and characterize high voltage (1-5 kV) AlGaN diodes, with a view to demonstrating the promise of AlGaN technology in future power systems. Their stability in the face of high temperature exposure will also be examined. To address the risk of EMI, the first phototransistor that heterogeneously integrates AlGaN with other compound semiconductors will be investigated for fast optical gating and high voltage blocking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, a therapist interacting with a radiation therapy machine may inadvertently perform a sequence of critical actions in an incorrect order; a communication network may experience a disruption and fail to deliver messages in time; or a malicious actor on the web may evolve  and obtain a wider range of exploits over time. Ideally, a system that is robust would ensure that its most critical requirements are satisfied even under possible deviations in the environment. This project aims to systematize the development of robust software by elevating robustness as a first-class quality attribute that can be explicitly analyzed for and designed into a system. To this end, the project will lay a rigorous foundation for software robustness and develop a set of fundamental analysis and design techniques to support methodologies for engineering robust systems. The results of this research will be incorporated into software engineering and formal method classes at Carnegie Mellon University.<br/><br/>This project will investigate (1) a formal notion of robustness for software systems and (2) specification and verification techniques to support activities for developing robust systems. In particular, the project will develop techniques for formally reasoning about the robustness of a system as an explicit property, to answer questions such as: How robust is the system against possible deviations in the environment? What deviations could result in the system violating a critical requirement? Given a pair of alternative designs, which one of them is more robust under what deviations? In addition, given a model of a system that is incapable of tolerating certain deviations, the project will develop techniques for robustifying the system, by automatically transforming the existing design into one that is robust against those deviations. Finally, the project will demonstrate the applicability and utility of robustness across multiple domains, in particular through two innovative applications of the proposed techniques: (1) robustness testing of security protocols and (2) robustification of a safety-critical interface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite ?time? playing a central role in those systems, most of the classic studies on graphs are based on the topological properties of static graphs (graphs that do not change over time). The existing works on dynamic graphs show only limited scalability for large-scale practical datasets. This proposed research aims at designing fast, scalable methods for revealing dynamic behaviors of a socio-technical system by developing innovative algorithmic and computing techniques.

Examples of such graphs include social networks, human contact networks, web graphs, and functional brain networks. The proposal addresses substructure-based problems such as finding evolving communities and enumerating interesting temporal subgraphs or motifs with applications in neuroscience, bioinformatics, infrastructure, and social domains. Even though there exists a rich literature for static graphs, the literature for dynamic graphs is very nascent. Existing parallel algorithms for dynamic graphs demonstrate limited scalability due to their low ratio of compute to memory operations and the irregular memory access patterns. Consequently, such algorithms show weak spatial and temporal locality, leading to poor cache utilization and high communication volume. The proposed research will utilize a unique collaboration with the Performance and Algorithms Group of Berkeley Lab to avail the most advanced user facilities and leading expertise to tackle the above technical challenges. The proposal aims at developing scalable parallel methods with efficient load-balancing and communication-avoidance techniques, data reduction approaches with sampling and sparsification, and efficient formalization of temporal metrics. Algorithmic methods generated from this proposal will be applicable in understanding dynamic properties of various real-world systems?for instance, locating key neurons in cortical (brain) networks, route-planning for time-varying traffic in infrastructure networks, modeling disease/virus or information propagation in social/contact networks.

While modern technology has provided people precise sensing tools and convenient communication devices, for many demanding tasks, the performance is fundamentally limited by classical physics and is far from satisfying. Quantum effects are required to further boost performance. However, quantum effects are usually fragile to the environmental noise ambient in practical scenarios, which makes enhancing performance by quantum technology challenging. The proposed project will solve the noise issue and develop robust quantum protocols for practical sensing and communication applications, including quantum radar, quantum communication networks and quantum sensor networks. The protocols will feature devices and systems that are currently off-the-shelf or realizable in the near-term. These research activities will integrate with an education plan to prepare the next generation of diverse Quantum Information Science (QIS) engineers who will be adaptive and creative innovators in a globally connected, innovation-driven world with great consideration of the societal impacts of their work. For the education plan, the PI will: (1) organize a workshop each summer oriented to industry that fosters a collaborative environment between academia and industry on QIS; (2) develop a new QIS course to augment the standard curriculum with education materials derived from this quantum sensing and communication CAREER project; and (3) develop an undergraduate summer research program to engage students from diverse backgrounds into the CAREER research. The proposed quantum sensing and communication system designs will impact the NSF?s Big 10 Ideas and cut across multiple research disciplines essential to the Nation?s competitiveness and prosperity, including quantum information, machine learning, and photonics. The expected project outcomes will apply to sensing and communication tasks that include deep-space communication, radar detection, inertia force sensing, and radio-frequency signal sensing. Such outcomes will lead to innovations in the aerospace, chemical, environmental protection, finance, healthcare, and information technology industries that impact society and the US economy. By working with industrial partners like General Dynamics, Arm Ltd., and Fidelity Investments, the PI and his group will help to translate fundamental quantum research into industry technologies. For the education plan, the proposed: (1) workforce development workshops will help to prepare US industry employees and university students for the future quantum edge; and (2) hands-on research experience with the PI?s group will enable undergraduates to gain problem-solving skills and a more in-depth knowledge of QIS to inspire them to follow QIS career pathways. Graduate students will obtain direct experience of mentoring under the PI?s supervision. <br/><br/>The proposed CAREER project will determine the ultimate quantum limits of sensing and communication tasks and develop entanglement-assisted (EA) protocols to advance real-world sensing and communication scenarios with near-term technology. The PI will propose, analyze, and verify protocol designs that can benefit from entanglement in the presence of noise for an EA quantum pulse compression radar, an EA communication network, and an EA sensor-network. The project team will combine numerical and analytical calculations in the theory and modeling of quantum systems and adopt advanced machine-learning tools for variational circuit optimization. The theory framework for analyzing different sensing and communication systems will be a solid foundation to explore EA quantum information processing in the presence of noise, and will include sensing and communication modeling, source and measurement optimization, and techniques to bound the capacity region. The proposed project will advance knowledge from both fundamental and practical angles. On a fundamental level, the research will deepen the understanding of the operational meaning of bipartite and multipartite entanglement and provide paradigms for multiple parameter estimation and distributed parameter estimation: estimating a global property of various local parameters.  On the application and engineering levels, the designed protocols will guide the near-term development of quantum devices for acquiring, storing, and processing information to meet the goal of realizing entanglement benefits in practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Helping students to develop good problem solving skills is an important part of engineering education because it prepares them for careers in the engineering workforce. Technological advances have provided undergraduate engineering students with new ways to collaborate and access online resources. These changes have also created unintended consequences such as the use of online homework solutions that are accessed directly and shared person-to-person. Using solutions inappropriately can create barriers to student learning. The significance of this issue, which has continued unabated with the emergence of new technologies, points to the need to approach this issue from a new direction. This project will use new methods to study how and why students use solutions when studying or solving engineering problems. These research findings will inform the development of instructional interventions and policies that help support engineering students? learning.<br/><br/>The scope of the research and intervention activities includes the study of two high-enrollment introductory engineering courses, mechanics and thermodynamics, that reach a large number of students in every subfield of engineering. The project will use innovative qualitative research methods to advance the field?s understanding of how and why students use homework solutions and to study the efficacy of instructional interventions and policy changes aimed at reducing inappropriate use of solutions. It is expected that these interventions and policies will improve student learning outcomes. The project team will collect data through student interviews as well as audio and video journals to develop rich descriptions of students' experiences getting through coursework. Ethnographic methods will be used to study how students navigate the cultures of the courses and the broader engineering programs they encounter, which will help elucidate patterns in students? justifications for using solutions and how students use them to learn. These patterns will inform instructional interventions co-developed with instructors and potential policy changes at the institution. The research findings, instructional interventions, and new policies will be disseminated to engineering faculty at other institutions through a workshop and publications so that other institutions will be able to adopt similar interventions and policies.

However, many people are not receiving the care they need to fully recover from their illnesses because of a shortage of health services and a lack of state-of-the-art treatment options. Studies have documented that up to two-thirds of patients who seek standard pharmacological and/or psychological interventions to emotional disorders will not respond. Noninvasive neurostimulation methods, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), are emerging techniques to treat patients who have failed multiple attempts of standard interventions. However, issues of variable response effects and inter-subject variability have arisen in numerous investigations of treating depression and other mental illnesses, which have prevented the broad application of noninvasive neurostimulation for clinical use. This EPSCoR Research Fellows RII Track-4:NSF fellowship will enable the PI from the University of Oklahoma, to partner with psychiatrists and scientists at the Medical University of South Carolina to develop a novel neurostimulation technology that is integrated with neuroimaging in a closed-loop design. This research and the associated partnerships will pave the way for developing individualized treatment with much improved outcomes in people with mental illness. This success can be further generalized to the neurostimulation treatment of other disorders.<br/><br/>Noninvasive neurostimulation is an emerging technology that is rapidly booming in the recent decade for treating many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the responses to a standard protocol varied greatly among individuals. Addressing the issue of heterogeneous responses will be an important step forward to exploit the full potential of neurostimulation as the treatment option. The key innovation of the project is to leverage the large-scale neural networks as biomarkers, using the algorithms previously established by the PI, to individually optimize the therapeutic outcomes of neurostimulations. A high-density, whole-head montage of multimodal electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be used in the project for recording in the human participants.

Historically, a technique called X-ray crystallography was preferred to obtain atomic-level structures of proteins. However, crystallography is undesirable for studying large and dynamic protein assemblies or proteins that reside in lipid membranes. But because proteins with these traits are key to many biological processes, new techniques to visualize their atomic structures are required to understand their cellular functions. An advanced form of microscopy called cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) is ideal for studying these challenging proteins, and recent advances have made it capable of achieving atomic resolution. This fellowship will support the PI and research team in acquiring hands-on training in cryoEM by experts at the Pacific Northwest Center for CryoEM (PNCC), a state-of-the-art user facility operated by the Oregon Health & Science University and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Upon completion of the fellowship, the researchers will be cryoEM specialists, and apply this new knowledge to visualize structures of the large membrane-embedded protein assemblies they study in atomic-level detail. Further, the fellowship will bolster research and education in the molecular life sciences at the University of Nebraska (NU) by importing cryoEM expertise there. This expertise will be passed to other researchers and students across Nebraska via lab-based and in-class experiences that will impart the theory and practice of this state-of-the-art structural technique to them. As no institution in the state has cryoEM capability, infrastructure, or expertise, this fellowship has potential to be transformative to Nebraskans.<br/><br/>The PI?s group use the specialized training in cryoEM to propel their structural biology capacities in new and transformative directions. CryoEM will enable the PI?s group to resolve 3D structures of the small membrane protein-comprised supramolecular machines they study that will help define the mechanistic principles that drive self-assembly of these proteins. These membrane protein assemblies warrant in-depth comprehension because they control two key biological processes in animals?fortification of epithelial intercellular spaces called tight junctions, and synthesis of fatty acids that produce lipids vital to membrane organization. The fellowship will function by establishing a collaborative training ecosystem between the PI?s group and PNCC, with the primary goal to acquire deep knowledge of the cryoEM workflow, which includes sample preparation; negative stain EM; grid screening and evaluation; image collection; image processing and particle classification; 3D model building and refinement; and structure determination by cryoEM. This cryoEM expertise will foster new independent and collaborative research in Nebraska by creating a core of specialists at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) that will train additional NU researchers, allowing many groups to use cryoEM and national centers like PNCC to determine structures of other important macromolecular systems. Educational objectives to teach future generations the theory and practice of state-of-the-art structural techniques like cryoEM will also be realized by integrating this training into the advising activities and undergraduate biochemistry courses the PI conducts at UNL. Because UNL, NU, and other regional institutions currently lack abilities in cryoEM, this fellowship will provide an essential knowledgebase that will have wide-reaching impacts on the research and educational trajectories of many individuals and groups throughout Nebraska and the Great Plains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second thrust is to theoretically study what representations can be efficiently learned by deep-learning models, and how are they encoded in the hidden weights of the neural networks after training. Finally, the investigator will study what statistical properties of the learned representations made them good for downstream tasks, which is critical to improving the interpretability of these neural network-based representations.

The only experimentally feasible way to answer this question is to look for neutrinoless double-beta (0???) decay, a proposed form of nuclear decay. Large Ge crystals have a higher volume-to-surface ratio which is advantageous for the collection of signals and rejection of backgrounds in a search for 0??? decay. GERDA and MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR have proved that a Ge-based ton-scale experiment can be built with sufficient low-background that will achieve a sensitivity capable of the potential discovery of 0??? decay. This RII Track-4 proposal will develop large-size Ge ring-contact (GeRC) detectors to further reduce backgrounds, complexity, and cost. The proposed research will advance Ge detector technology for cosmology, astronomy, homeland security, and industrial applications. Results from this project will be published in scholarly journals and disseminated through collaboration with industry. Research activities are closely integrated with education and outreach efforts: both graduate and undergraduate students will work on the project, thus gaining cutting-edge skills and expertise in Ge crystal purification and detector development. The main focus of undergraduate education and outreach activities is to encourage women to pursue STEM majors. <br/><br/>The sensitivity goal for the Large Enriched Ge Experiment for Neutrinoless double beta (0???)

This RII Track-4 proposal will explore large-size detectors through research and development (R&D) on GeRC detectors using high-purity Ge crystals grown by the University of South Dakota (USD). With the collaboration of Professor Rusty Harris (Host) of Texas A&M University (TAMU) and Professor John Wilkerson (collaborator) of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), the PI will fabricate GeRC detectors at TAMU and test them at UNC. Currently, LEGEND-200 has successfully tested inverted coaxial point-contact (ICPC) Ge detectors that have a typical mass of ~2 kg. To further increase the mass per detector, a new detector concept based on GeRC detectors is promising, as it can potentially be used to make a Ge detector as large as ~6 kg.  Although they have been modeled, a GeRC detector has yet to be fabricated and tested for its energy resolution and pulse shape properties. The degradation of energy resolution seen with Ge detectors that is due to incomplete charge collection in large-size Ge crystals will also be an obstacle for LEGEND-1000. This project will help to resolve three key challenges: fabrication of a GeRC detector with a mass of ~2 ? 3 kg, measurement of the energy resolution and pulse shape discrimination in a large-size GeRC detector, and analysis of the quality of USD-grown crystals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By recruiting, preparing, and placing a greater number of highly qualified STEM educators in rural settings, this effort will allow rural districts to hire a larger number of well-prepared teachers. In turn, this will allow schools to better engage the breadth of learners within northeast Nebraska and other rural settings nationwide. To meet this need, Wayne State College, in concert with multiple local educational partners, will support and prepare teachers through its existing dual-credit educator pathway program. This intentional pathway program is guided by principles of equity, excellence, and affordability. The pathway program is designed to change the way teachers are recruited and prepared for their world of work. This project will recruit and support high school students interested in becoming STEM teachers through early access to college-level courses and exposure to careers in STEM education through hands-on, experiential learning opportunities.  The project will engage participating students through college acceptance, STEM internships, teacher candidacy, scholarship support, student teaching, and ultimately placement as a STEM educator in a high-need district. <br/><br/>This project at Wayne State College includes partnerships with Columbus Public Schools, Grand Island Public Schools, Norfolk Public Schools, South Sioux Community Schools, northeast Nebraska?s Educational Service Unit #1, and several smaller rural districts throughout the state. Teachers in high-need and rural districts often do not receive the preservice training or in-service support that they need to successfully embark on long careers in high-need districts. The project?s first goal seeks to provide scholarships and professional development to twenty undergraduates as part of an effort to increase the number of highly qualified mathematics and science teachers graduating from Wayne State College and being placed in teaching positions at high-need school districts. Secondly, through pedagogical innovations, experiential learning opportunities, and sustained peer mentoring, this project aims to improve the cultural competency, STEM content knowledge, and overall preparation of graduates to teach mathematics and science in high-need, rural secondary schools. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

The project investigates the mechanisms that underlie long-term memory. A guiding hypothesis of the project is that memories are not stored in the brain as changes in the connections between neurons but, rather, as modifications in the nuclei of neurons. A major goal of the project is to identify the processes that mediate the nuclear modifications that encode long-term memory. Data from the proposed project could facilitate the development of novel treatments for disorders of memory, including Alzheimer?s disease and posttraumatic stress disorder. In addition, the project enhances the scientific literacy of high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented or economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  This goal is accomplished through formal lectures on the neurobiology of memory to be offered in UC Santa Barbara?s Summer Research Academy (SRA), as well as giving high school students in the SRA and undergraduates associated with UCLA?s Brain Research Institute Brain Research Institute Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (BRI SURE) the opportunity to participate in guided research in the Principal Investigator?s laboratory during the summer.<br/><br/>Recently, the principal investigator has discovered that long-term memory (LTM) in the marine snail Aplysia appears to be stored in neurons by nuclear changes. One type of nuclear change that has been implicated in LTM storage in Aplysia is epigenetic changes; however, genomic changes may also play a critical role in encoding LTM. A type of genomic change that may mediate LTM is retrotransposition. The proposed project investigates the potential involvement of retrotransposons in LTM in Aplysia. Specifically, the investigators test whether retrotransposition is required for a type of synaptic memory, long-term facilitation (LTF) of Aplysia sensorimotor synapses in dissociated cell culture. To accomplish this objective, the investigators test whether inhibitors of reverse transcriptase and of DNA double-strand breaks disrupt LTF. The project also identifies species of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that trigger nuclear changes that encode a form of non-associative memory in Aplysia, long-term sensitization (LTS) of the siphon-withdrawal reflex. Both RNA-seq and small RNA-seq will be performed on RNA extracted from the identified sensory and motor neurons dissociated from the central nervous system of LTS-trained and untrained animals. Differential expression analyses on the RNA-seq data is carried out to identify potential memory-inducing ncRNAs; the mnemonic potency of the candidate ncRNAs then is assessed through bioassays performed using sensory and motor neurons in dissociated cell culture. Data from the proposed project can, potentially, significantly alter thinking about how the brain encodes memory. This, in turn, could lead to new approaches to artificial intelligence (AI). At present, models of machine learning in AI are heavily influenced by synaptic models of memory that are based on neuroscientific findings. Finally, results from the proposed project may facilitate the development of novel treatments for disorders of memory, including Alzheimer?s disease and posttraumatic stress disorder.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metastatic cancer, however, is generally not treated with radiotherapies due to the need for prior knowledge of the metastatic sites.

With the ever-high design complexity of modern integrated systems, traditional electronic design-automation algorithms cannot guarantee convergence of the design process, fail to predict output quality, and often settle for lower performance. Considering billions of dollars spent on developing a system in a new technology node, the loss of profit due to not having the system ready on time for release to market or losing the performance benefits of the new technology node cannot be mitigated. This project investigates a fundamentally new approach for circuit global routing -- a critical automated design step and a primary bottleneck in the design process. The primary objective is to route circuits with deep-learning models in a highly parallelizable manner, shortening the turnaround design time by orders of magnitude. More broadly, the results from this project are expected to shift existing physical-design paradigms toward a learning-driven predictable process that can exploit the advantages of the underlying technology to their full potential in a timely manner. Executed by a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution, this award presents a unique opportunity to engage with a diverse minority population and creates training opportunities in circuit design, electronic design automation, and machine learning. As such, the project is anticipated to have a strong economic and societal impact.<br/><br/>Designed via a pile of intractable optimizations to tackle the NP-hard problem of global routing, traditional routers are characterized by convergence issues and unpredictable routing quality. While there is a general agreement on potential benefits of realizing routing with machine-learning (ML) models, not a single end-to-end learning framework has been demonstrated to route unseen high-resolution practical integrated circuits.<br/>To address this challenge, global routing will be investigated as an ML problem in which nets are viewed as the missing parts of a routing solution and reconstructed, in a preferred order, with imaging ML models while considering the overall minimum wirelength objective and congestion constraints. The insights from this study will be exploited to develop a reinforcement-learning framework comprising: (i) graph neural network for encoding routing attributes, (ii) net ordering policy for determining the next net to be routed, and (iii) variational autoencoder to route individual unseen nets. The resulting design methodology and ML models, architectures, and algorithms will be integrated in an end-to-end ML router and demonstrated on existing benchmarks and commercial products provided by industrial collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predicting and controlling thermal radiation interactions with matter is crucial for the success of thermal and solar reactor technologies. However, evaluation of radiative transport in dynamic systems with flowing and reactive particles is a fundamental challenge in the thermal sciences community. Challenges in model development stem from the necessity to track interactions of radiation with ensembles of particles that are continually evolving. Flow can affect spatial distributions of particles, and chemical reactions can influence size, shape, and particle concentration, and material properties. Experimentally, isolating underlying dependencies of measured outcomes due to compounded physical effects also poses complexities. The overarching vision of this project is to establish a more holistic understanding of this flow-radiation-reaction coupling using computational modeling with complementary measurements. An integrated education and outreach plan has been developed, in partnership with the University of Michigan Museum, aimed at increasing literacy and excitement for solar energy technologies among middle- and high-school students in Michigan. This will be accomplished through training in scientific communication for graduate students, community outreach with interactive demonstrations, and curriculum development for middle schoolers. <br/><br/>The main research goal is to advance the fundamental and mechanistic understanding of radiative transport in flowing and reactive particles with applications to high-temperature thermal systems, and thermochemical and photocatalytic reactors for fuels production. The approach is to perform direct numerical simulations of radiation using probabilistic and deterministic techniques for selected materials, flow configurations and reacting systems. These rigorous, yet computationally intensive models will be connected to more tractable data-driven models and experimental measurements to deduce generalized radiative- and heat-transfer correlations. New experimental techniques are developed to measure particle temperatures, while in motion, using high-speed thermal imaging and fiber-optic pyrometry. Measurements will be used to establish new knowledge on how ensembles of particles can be functionalized to achieve improved radiative and overall energy transport.  In addition to developing powerful computational analyses and experimental diagnostic tools, a deep level of understanding will be cultivated by mapping the influence of several key dimensionless parameters on a system?s heat-transfer performance, energy conversion efficiencies and the rates of fuel production. By establishing this currently missing link, the project will help fast-track materials development and inform design and operation for a host of energy systems to boost their overall performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This effort addresses a critical problem in the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in US manufacturing, since AI methods benefit from training on large datasets and manufacturers typically keep their data secret. The investigators will research methods for preserving the privacy of that data, with the goal of enabling a future manufacturing service infrastructure to aggregate, manage and reuse data from multiple manufacturers.  Such an infrastructure can benefit manufacturing by establishing a data-sharing marketplace that enables domestic partnerships and accelerates the adoption of AI technologies, thus enhancing the international market share of the United States.

The selection of suitable data sources for data aggregation depends on the categorization of the data derived from the various sources for similarity in data distribution and variable relationship. The Cost-sensitive Federated AI (CoFedAI) framework will facilitate data exchange to unlock the value of knowledge transfer for AI in manufacturing by employing a cost-sensitive multi-armed bandit data-sharing framework that requests data from multiple stakeholders. The hierarchical framework will extend the multi-armed bandit to multiple data sources and decompose similarity into two interconnected elements: manufacturer similarity and data similarity.  In addition, the framework will assess and differentiate the contributions from multiple data owners in manufacturing based on the similarity metrics.

In 2006, researchers established the Loma Ridge global change experiment in Irvine, California, to study drought, pollution, and fire impacts on local grasslands and shrublands. These unique ecosystems provide critical habitat and recreational benefits while serving as a living laboratory for environmental research. Still, as a relatively new field research facility, Loma Ridge has not yet realized its full potential. Therefore, the goal of this project is to transform Loma Ridge into a globally recognized hub for transdisciplinary research on climate adaptation with benefits for society and the environment. A series of workshops will engage a broad community of scholars, students, and community organizations in planning discussions about Loma Ridge. Together, this community will develop collaborations aimed at applying scientific research to improve land management, climate resilience, and conservation practices. Specific goals for the workshops include: develop a strategic plan, establish an executive committee, grow the research and stakeholder community, provide professional development training to graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, and design a communications strategy and website. Achieving these goals will engage the private sector, residents, and the scientific community in tackling environmental problems in Southern California and beyond.<br/><br/>In the last 15 years at Loma Ridge, researchers have developed an interdisciplinary understanding of the ecological processes and environmental variables that govern plant and microbial communities in Southern California. Studies have quantified the response of Mediterranean grassland and shrubland ecosystems to environmental change with a replicated whole-ecosystem manipulation that includes factorial combinations of ambient conditions, nitrogen addition, added precipitation, and reduced precipitation. Thus far, the experiment has supported over 50 scientific publications on plant communities, microbial communities, and ecohydrology along with dozens of student projects and multiple outreach programs. These activities have been conducted in partnership with the Irvine Ranch Conservancy that manages the Orange County-owned land on which the experiment is located. Through a series of proposed workshops, the investigators will bring together researchers and land management experts to establish a long-term vision and strategic plan for Loma Ridge. Experts will be drawn from a range of fields, including the social sciences, to assemble a transdisciplinary planning team. The team will identify long-term goals in three main research areas: climate response of communities and ecosystems, recovery of previously restored habitats, and mitigation of ecosystem disturbance. In addition, the planning team will develop policies and best practices to manage data and ensure effective communication. The plan to expand Loma Ridge?s scope and capacity will facilitate new research infrastructure, training opportunities, and outreach programs. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will bring diverse intellectual perspectives while gaining scientific and professional skills required for their career success. Together, these activities will position Loma Ridge as a hub for research and educational programs that focus on mitigating the impacts of human-caused environmental change.

However, modeling and designing controllers for systems of this scale is technically and computationally challenging at best, and intractable in the worst case. As the magnitude, complexity, and connectivity of these and future systems accelerates, so too do the technical challenges. Feedback control is the mechanism that enables engineers to guarantee desirable system behaviors such as stability (do the effects of disturbances decay over time?), performance (is the system operating efficiently?), and robustness (can performance and stability be maintained despite operating in an uncertain environment?). For networked systems, feedback control can only be applied in a distributed manner, there is no central decision maker. Unfortunately, distributed control is theoretically and computationally more challenging than its centralized counterpart. Moreover, distributed control requires transmission of potentially sensitive data over a network. Despite recent progress in distributed control and data privacy, there is a large gap between the complexity of systems we can control, and complexity of systems we want to control. The difference further increases when we additionally ask for data privacy guarantees. This project seeks to bridge the gap between theory, scalable computation, and data privacy and thus help make autonomous systems that we depend upon safe and trustworthy. Results from this research will enable the widespread adoption of distributed control in the aerospace, robotics, automotive, and energy industries.<br/><br/>This project consists of three foundational research topics; i) learning a dynamical system model from partially observed data, ii) designing robust and optimal distributed controllers from the model, and iii) integrating data privacy mechanisms into the modeling and control workflow. The contention of this research project is that it is impossible to achieve these goals for large-scale networked systems using traditional ?exact? methods. Instead we will formulate ?approximations? of the learning and control problems that can be solved at a fraction of the cost of doing so for the full problem. Correctly designed, these approximations can provide stability and performance guarantees for the original large-scale system. To achieve this formulation, we will develop new theory and algorithms based on randomized methods for numerical linear algebra and high-dimensional probability, customized for distributed control problems. Moreover, data privacy will be naturally accounted for as sensitive data gets compressed and transformed in the approximation stages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Observations of X-rays emitted by stars at various stages of their life, and from the remnants of their violent deaths in supernova explosions, are a powerful tool to study the physical processes at work. The interpretation, however, of these observations relies heavily on our knowledge of the atomic physics at play. Given the expected capabilities of future observatories, the current lack of experimental data will become a limiting factor. The goal of this fellowship project is to gather experimental data about interactions of neon ions with hydrogen and helium gas commonly found in relevant astrophysical environments. These data will both improve our understanding of basic atomic physics of highly charged ions and our ability to make use of the data collected by future large space observatories. The fellowship program will also train the PI and a graduate student from the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in techniques relevant to scientific areas of national importance such as quantum sensing, quantum computing, and low-temperature physics. This will enable them to pass this knowledge on and to train graduate and undergraduate students at UNH in these fields.<br/><br/>Charge exchange, a process in which a highly charged ion captures an electron from a neutral atom, plays a significant role in many astrophysical plasmas. It is a recombination process that results in emission line intensities that differ from collisional excitation, and can serve as an important diagnostic of the ionization balance and composition of a plasma. Correct interpretation of astrophysical data requires detailed and accurate knowledge of charge exchange cross sections, and typically relies on theoretical modeling of synthetic spectra. During two fellowship visits to the National Institute for Standards and Technology?s (NIST) Boulder Laboratories, the PI and a graduate student will carry out a sequence of measurements to test models of energy-level resolved charge exchange cross sections of highly ionized neon Ne(8,9,10)+ with neutral gasses. These benchmarks will improve the fidelity of models and our ability to interpret astrophysical X-ray data. The measurement campaign will utilize X-ray transition edge sensor microcalorimeters for high-resolution spectroscopy and a miniature Electron Beam Ion Trap to create and trap the ions. The fellowship project is intended to be the starting point of a broader collaboration between the PI and groups at NIST. It will expand beyond the PI?s current work in high-energy astrophysics enable him to participate in future measurement campaigns with highly charged ions and in the analysis of data relevant to astrophysics. Expertise gained during this fellowship will also enable the PI to carry out other X-ray measurements using equipment already available at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), and to train students at UNH in techniques relevant to scientific areas of national importance such as quantum sensing, quantum computing, and low-temperature physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fuzzing, which tests a target program with mutated inputs, is an effective technique for vulnerability discovery. Whitebox fuzzing (also known as concolic execution) collects detailed runtime information such as path constraints to precisely determine which input bytes to change and how to change them. Unfortunately, concolic execution has not been widely used, because of its low efficiency, lack of scalability, and unsatisfactory usability. This project aims to bring vulnerability discovery capability to the next level by significantly improving the efficiency, scalability, and usability of concolic execution, and designing a fuzzing system with concolic execution being the central component. The proposed research, if successful, can push vulnerability-discovery research to another level: finding vulnerabilities much faster than before, and finding vulnerabilities that are otherwise impossible to find using the existing techniques. As a result, more vulnerabilities can be patched before attackers find and exploit them, improving the security and quality of software systems. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop: (1) a fast binary-code concolic execution engine, which significantly improves the efficiency of concolic execution for binary code by automatically switching between concrete mode and symbolic mode; (2) dual concolic execution, which combines source-code concolic execution and binary-code concolic execution to achieve best efficiency and usability simultaneously; and (3) a new hybrid fuzzing framework, in which concolic execution plays a central role, in terms of whether or not to flip a branch, which testcase to select next, and which testcases are discarded or synchronized with the other fuzzers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The commercial opportunity is large, with over $20B spent on US pick and pack wages annually.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop new methods for rapidly training artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled robotic systems built for object identification and manipulation. Warehouse object manipulation tasks are variable and automating them often requires custom solutions for each customer and facility. These custom solutions are often prohibitively expensive. To solve these problems, an industrial operating system that can be deployed across many configurations of materials handling processes is required. This project aims to develop modules critical to scaling commercial deployments, such as quality control vision systems, automated assessments of item pickability, and enhanced AI systems for robotic picking. The anticipated result of this project is an industrial AI-enabled robotic operating system that allows rapid configuration of robotic systems to implement highly-optimized processes for picking and packing individual items in e-commerce logistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wind turbine icing represents the most significant threat to turbine efficiency and structural integrity in cold climates. With total installed wind power capacity approaching 1,000 GW globally and 120 GW in USA alone, wind turbine icing is found to cause significant power loss and additional maintenance & operational costs, valued up to billions of dollars on the fast-growing wind energy market. One notable example to highlight the importance of wind turbine icing protection is the massive turbine shutdown after a severe storm blasted Texas in February 2021. This project is primarily intended to develop a novel WTIPS to ensure safer and more efficient operation of wind turbines in cold climates. The primary educational outcome of this program is to cultivate future entrepreneurial leaders that are capable of leading strong and diverse teams toward societal impact through commercialization. The program also includes various activities to ensure broad participation of female students and those from under-represented minority (URM) groups in the leadership development and entrepreneurial education.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to develop novel, plasma-based WTIPS that properly integrates Dielectric-Barrier-Discharge (DBD) plasma actuation and ?state-of-the-art? hydro-/ice-phobic coatings for effective wind turbine icing protection. While DBD plasma actuators will be used to actively repel ice accretion in the critical regions (e.g., near blade leading edges), the hydro-/ice-phobic surfaces/coatings with ultra-low ice adhesion strength will be leveraged to efficiently prevent ice accretion and water runback over blade surfaces. A comprehensive icing tunnel testing campaign will be conducted to examine the anti-/de-icing performance of DBD plasma actuations under various icing conditions representative of wind turbine icing envelope. The mechanical durability of the hydro-/ice-phobic coatings to resist mechanical wearing due to ?rain erosion? effects and performance degradation due to long-time exposure to UV light emission will also be evaluated systematically. In addition to conducting lab experiments, prototype development and field experiments are also planned to improve the technology readiness level (TRL) of the proposed plasma based WTIPS for accelerated technology commercialization. The success of this project would lead to a new class of low-power, plasma-based WTIPS to effectively repel ice accretion over turbine blade surfaces at much lower power costs (i.e., > 80% in energy saving) than the current WTIPS designs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research suggests that students exhibit greater motivation and resilience to challenges when they believe that their intellectual abilities can improve. These students ultimately have better academic outcomes than those who believe their intellectual abilities are fixed. This project will design interventions to foster positive student beliefs. The interventions will be customized to the cultural and institutional context in which they will be implemented. This project will involve developing, implementing, and assessing the short-term and long-term psychological and academic outcomes of interventions to help undergraduate introductory biology students adopt more positive beliefs about their abilities. The interventions? effectiveness will be assessed using a new, high-quality measure of students? beliefs. This project will answer pressing research questions related to implementing interventions and the psychological theories underlying this work. The significance of this project will include advancing the understanding of psychological theory and improving educational outcomes for all students. Importantly, this project has potential to improve equity in academic outcomes by being especially beneficial for students who encounter additional barriers in higher education. These students include those who are first-generation college students and those from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, among other marginalized groups. <br/><br/>This project will address three of the most pressing research questions to advance the understanding of how mindset interventions could be used to improve student success and equity in science. The project?s research questions include: (1) How do mindset interventions at two different levels, student and instructor, affect student outcomes independently and in concert? (2) What are the mechanisms through which mindset interventions at both the student- and instructor-level influence students? experiences in the classroom, academic engagement, and academic outcomes in the short and long term? And (3) How do students? racial/ethnic identity and generation in college moderate any identified effects? These questions will be addressed by carrying out large-scale, fully-crossed, randomly-assigned field experiments in introductory biology courses at four sites (N>10,000 students). Growth mindset interventions have shown great potential to address large-scale educational inequities in logistically simple, cost-effective ways. This project will capitalize on this potential by investigating how mindset messages from instructors enhance the effectiveness of interventions at the undergraduate level. This work will not only have broad impacts by addressing social inequities to broaden participation in STEM, but will also have intellectual merit by generating a more nuanced understanding of how contextual messages moderate intervention effectiveness.

The work will focus on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance (PA) program, which is the primary source of disaster relief for state and local governments to restore damaged infrastructure. The structure of PA could give rise to a moral hazard, whereby state and local governments defer maintenance, eschew mitigation, and permit development in risky places, all with a full expectation of receiving aid. On the flip side, there is anecdotal evidence that navigating this system is daunting and that communities with fewer resources may receive less aid. Ultimately, knowledge is poor on how PA influences local infrastructure decisions, infrastructure quality, and community outcomes. This work will serve as a preliminary evidentiary basis for debate on policy reform. The impact of the work will be expanded at multiple levels, including with policymakers through carefully constructed workshops designed to co-produce knowledge, and with future practitioners through engineering-civics modules so that engineering students can recognize their role in creating resilient communities. A civics education provides the societal context in which engineers will practice and gives them the impetus to address pressing societal questions related to America?s infrastructure.<br/><br/><br/>This CAREER project will develop an integrated multi-scale framework to serve as an evidentiary basis for debate on disaster policy reform. Novel aspects of the work include (1) isolating how local capacity influences the level of PA that is awarded and its repercussions on distributive equity and local recovery pathways using statistical models; (2) comprehensively evaluating decision-making processes by local officials in response to federal disaster policy using utility theory and semi-structured interviews; (3) integrating this knowledge into flexible simulation models to conduct ex-ante testing of policy reforms. Model validation and knowledge sharing will occur during workshops designed to engage policymakers, researchers, and engineering practitioners. This work will serve as an exemplar of how integrating engineering, data science, and risk domains can inform proactive and climate-ready disaster policy and also the importance of educating future engineers on how federal infrastructure policy influences risk in the urban landscape. As such, this CAREER project will incorporate an engineering-civics education across multiple engineering courses, including a new data science course ?Data Analysis for Civic Impact.?

Decades of research has attempted to use this relationship to understand how habitat degradation might affect species abundance at different sites. For example, if the geographic range of a species is suddenly restricted due to land use change or other factors, how might local abundance in the other sites change? However, these so-called abundance-occupancy relationships are far from general. The proposed research aims to gauge the generality of abundance-occupancy relationships in a diverse set of species groups across both aquatic and terrestrial systems. In doing so, the research will estimate the dependency of these relationships on sampling procedures, geographic distribution, environmental conditions, and species groups. This collaborative research will involve the training of multiple graduate students, and the science will be incorporated into teaching and workshops aimed both at college undergraduates and high school students in underserved communities. <br/><br/>The scaling of species abundance with occupancy is claimed to be a general law in population ecology and macroecology. However, the data to test these relationships often comes from non-standardized, opportunistic surveys of a small subset of species. Combined with the variety of statistical methods applied, there is mixed support for abundance-occupancy relationships for single species. Understanding the conditions which lead to this variability in evidence is an obtrusive knowledge gap challenging this fundamental macroecological hypothesis. Leveraging spatially replicated and standardized data resources of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), this research will examine how slopes of abundance-occupancy relationships vary as a function of species traits (e.g., trophic level), taxonomic relationships, habitats (e.g., aquatic, terrestrial), geographic range, spatial distribution of sampled sites, and the local community context. Further, the project will use theoretical models to determine the conditions under which abundance-occupancy relationships emerge. This exhaustive exploration of species life history, niche requirements, and the spatial structure of sampled sites will challenge the abundance-occupancy relationship against the hypothesis of simple stochastic processes. This proposal will leverage NEON data on species abundances and fraction of occupied sites to examine abundance?occupancy relationships for a large set of taxa. Combining the NEON data and theoretical metacommunity models, this research will expand the theory underlying abundance-occupancy relationships, and gauge the empirical support for these relationships. Together, this will lead to a more synthetic understanding of these relationships and how they relate to other macroecological patterns in nature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genes in bacteria are not only inherited from parent to offspring but can also transfer between different species. This ?horizontal gene transfer? is often caused by small genetic elements called conjugative plasmids. These plasmids carry the machinery to move copies of themselves into new bacterial cells. A gene on one of these plasmids can inhabit very different host cells over time. A mutation in this gene may then have different effects in each host. This means genes could evolve differently during parent offspring transmission than when they are transferred horizontally between species. This project combines mathematical models and experiments with different bacterial species to measure the effect of horizontal transfer on the evolution of an antibiotic resistance gene and determine how that influences adaptation to changing conditions.  Because antibiotic resistance genes are often located on these plasmids, this will aid in combating the evolution of drug resistance. Additional broader impacts include the development of learning tools and a new undergraduate course that will provide authentic research experiences for students. <br/><br/>This project has three research aims. First, the researchers will propagate communities with combinations of three bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and monitor the evolution of a plasmid-borne gene coding for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Horizontal gene transfer will be manipulated during this process to determine the role of transfer between species in evolution of drug resistance. Second, genetically engineered bacteria will be used to determine why certain mutational sets are favored during horizontal transfer. Mathematically modeling of the results will produce predictions about whether horizontal transfer speeds or hinders the evolution of drug resistance. Third, the researchers will build a computational model to incorporate more realistic features of microbial communities, including more complex environments, migration, and competition between different bacterial species. This model will be tested in live bacterial communities with horizontal transfer turned on or off through plasmid engineering. Overall, this project will elucidate the role that horizontal genetic inheritance plays in the evolution of bacterial communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These volcanoes arguably represent the largest geologic system in the Earth?s crust. By analyzing the lavas erupted at the MOR, geologists understand how these magmas are produced and how they chemically change as they rise to the surface.  However, less is understood about depths of formation and how that may change in different parts of the MOR system. New data on depth of formation of the crystals in MOR lavas, based on CO2 in trapped droplets of magma in crystals (melt inclusions), indicate that the crystals are produced over a wide depth range. Those crystals therefore provide a record of magma compositions encountered during transport from depth and of processes controlling ocean crust formation. This study will chemically analyze microscopic melt inclusions and crystals to understand how the depth of magma formation varies globally. This new data will provide information on the depth of crystallization in different MOR environments and the carbon budget of the mantle. A core aspect of this proposal involves outreach to students at the tribal colleges in South Dakota which will consist of three parts including current programs at South Dakota Mines, mentoring students from Oglala Lakota College (OLC), and providing advice on the development of the analytical facilities at OLC.<br/><br/><br/>Current understanding of the evolution of the ocean crust relies heavily on submarine volcanic glasses and, more recently, melt inclusion (MI) compositions. Such data is most informative about the complex array of mixing and differentiation processes active in the upper mantle and crust - in essence ?what? is happening.  What has been difficult to constrain is ?where? specific processes are active in terms of depth, making it challenging to resolve the influences of processes occurring in the melting regime versus those that occur during transport to the surface. New data on depth of entrapment for melt inclusions (based on CO2 saturation/concentration) indicate that much of the crystal cargo in ocean floor basalts, particularly those from plagioclase ultraphyric basalts (PUB) are the products of crystallization at a wide range of pressure. They therefore provide an opportunity to investigate how the array of magma compositions evolves during transport and how the distribution of energy and mass of the processes controlling ocean crust formation differs between tectonic settings (different spreading rates, magma supply, extent of melting, etc.). This study will conduct combined analysis by electron microprobe (for major element composition), Laser ICP-MS (trace element compositions), secondary ion mass spectrometry (glass CO2, H2O, S), and Raman spectroscopy (MI bubble density/composition). The samples selected represent a number of PUB lavas from a range of settings, on axis, pull apart basins, ultra-slow to intermediate spreading rates and from ridges characterized by different crustal thicknesses. This new information will improve understanding of a number of fundamental questions in MORB petrology including: 1) the comparative depth of crystallization in different MOR environments for olivine and plagioclase (how crystal sorting influence what is being sampled), 2) the depth dependence of the processes responsible for MOR differentiation, 3) the extent to which CO2/trace element ratios can be used to estimate the mantle C budget.

Soft morphing polymers that can change their shapes and therefore functionalities upon exposure to external stimuli are important for many applications, including soft robotics, artificial muscles, and tissue repair. Despite advancement in this exciting and ever-growing field, the rational design, manufacturing, and applications of innovative morphing materials and structures have been significantly limited by the lack of fundamental mechanics understanding of novel active polymers like liquid crystal elastomers.

In addition, rapid testing is crucial to combat the pandemic as exemplified by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This project aims to design a direct Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) based point of care diagnostic system without pre-amplification of viral genomes. It will allow ultralow and ultrasensitive detection of many diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases) at an early stage when the concentration of viral genomes in body fluids (i.e., urine, blood, saliva) is still very low and not sufficient to be detected by existing technologies. This NSF EPSCoR RII Track-4 fellowship provides the opportunity to collaborate with a renowned expert in point-of-care diagnostics for infectious diseases in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Connecticut to achieve this goal. The successful completion of this project will lead to noninvasive, inexpensive, mass-producible systems for early detection, treatment outcome evaluation of diseases, greatly improving patient morbidity and reducing healthcare cost, particularly important to Nevada, which consistently ranks near the bottom in terms of higher rates of the 12 leading causes of death.<br/><br/>The objectives of the project are to (1) integrate nanoantenna with super-hydrophobic surfaces for enhancing the CRISPR/Cas12a detection sensitivity without pre-amplification; (2) integrate the designed enhanced CRISPR/Cas12a fluorescence detection module with microfluidics for viral detection in the blood sample. Although CRISPR based point of care diagnostic system has emerged as a popular technology and a powerful tool for rapid screening due to its simplicity and flexibility, it still has many limitations such as low stability in complex biological samples. One promising solution is to explore the nanoantenna technique to trigger the enhanced Localized surface plasmon. However, the nanoantenna technique is still far from being routinely implemented in biomedical fields due to a major obstacle not from plasmonics but from the mass transport: Most nanoantennas typically rely on diffusion to capture target molecules, which makes the detection time impractically long. This project integrates the nanoantenna with the superhydrophobic surface to address this diffusion limit. Droplets over super-hydrophobic surfaces maintain quasi spheres during evaporation and do not wet the surface. Therefore, the droplet evaporation replaces the diffusion and concentrates molecules onto the sensitive regions of the nanoantenna, becoming the dominant mechanism of mass transfer. The droplet evaporation time is not only much shorter than the diffusion time but also can be actively controlled, which is an additional benefit. The combination of plasmonics and super-hydrophobic surfaces offers a unique solution to the aforementioned key challenge and holds the promising for ultralow and ultrasensitive biosensing platforms enabled by CRISPR. The training and research experience provided by this RII Track-4 fellowship will allow the PI to successfully transition from the background of material science and engineering to a biomedical researcher.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to reveal the mechanism by which manganese and calcium ions bind to a photosynthetic protein to make an active site where molecular oxygen is released when water is oxidized. Protein samples will be prepared in the PI?s home laboratory and then studied using advanced instrumentation in the Solar Energy Conversion Group at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The PI and one graduate student will gain hands-on experience in spectroscopic techniques. Skills learned during this fellowship will advance the development of this type of instrumentation at the home institution to increase research capabilities and provide opportunities for future students.<br/><br/>This project aims to reveal the chemical mechanism of the assembly of the Photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). This metallic cluster is built in situ from free manganese ions, calcium ions, and water without the use of protein transporters or scaffolds. Advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy tools available at ANL will be used to characterize protein samples prepared to mimic various stages of OEC assembly. The hosts at ANL will provide facility access, training, technical expertise, and assistance with data analysis. Through this work, new insights into the mechanism of OEC assembly will be produced and a new collaboration between the PI and hosts at ANL will be established. The skills and knowledge in advanced EPR methods gained by the PI will be used to improve the research infrastructure in Louisiana.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They play a central role in the transport of sediment in lakes, rivers, and oceans, and they are also important in emerging and potentially transformative technologies such as deep-sea mining and geoengineering. Despite a rich history of research on gravity currents, some fundamental scenarios have yet to be explored or remain substantially unresolved. This collaborative project will integrate analytical modeling, numerical simulation and laboratory experimentation with a unique field experimental data set to advance understanding of particle-laden gravity currents. This project has potential for transformative impacts by informing environmental regulations for such emerging industries as deep-sea mining. Deep-sea mining is expected to re-suspend large volumes of sediment in the pristine abyssal ocean environment, and the knowledge and models developed through this project will provide the toolbox needed to assess the evolution of these sediment plumes.  The project will provide training for university students at all academic levels and for high-school students who will participate in the project through established programs at MIT and UCSB.  <br/><br/>The project is divided into three interconnected topics. The first concerns the evolution of gravity and particle-driven currents released from a moving source. The goals are to understand how the ratio of source speed to buoyancy velocity influences the dynamics of the current, investigate the role of background current, and develop empirical models that predict transport processes. The second point of focus is to quantify sediment detrainment from polydisperse particle-driven currents and determine its sensitivity to the particle size and velocity distribution through concurrent laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Empirical models of polydisperse particle-driven currents will be extended to include entrainment and detrainment and incorporated into the moving source gravity current model. Finally, the role of flocculation and aggregation of particles on the propagation of polydisperse particle-driven currents will be experimentally investigated by systematically varying the sediment?s history, with the goal of developing macroscale numerical models for flocculation and integrating the findings into the moving source model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current practices in handling data incompatibility and quality issues are manual and time-consuming. In addition, these practices are customized for individual projects, a process hard to adapt to different projects. Moreover, the sewer inspection data remains fragmented within the utilities due to the lack of proper data management solutions, which makes data less accessible for asset management. The envisioned technology will help to combine sewer inspection data with standard PACP (Pipeline Assessment Certification Program) format, ensure data quality, and integrate historical data for easy and secured access so that cost-effective asset management plans can be developed based on true conditions. Each utility could save up to 80% of the time (on the order of months) for manual data quality assurance. With accurate and accessible sewer condition data, it is anticipated that at least 20% (approximately $600 million) of the annual spending on pipe rehabilitation can be saved for the entire industry. More importantly, improved sewer infrastructure condition can greatly reduce gastrointestinal (GI) illness emergency room visits induced by sanitary sewer overflow events. <br/><br/>The proposed project is to 1) develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled algorithm to resolve data incompatibility issues to maintain data fidelity and facilitate data exchange among different software platforms; 2) establish a holistic AI-enabled methodological framework to automatically detect and treat data quality issues, including data records inconsistency, incompleteness, and duplicates, caused by the interruption of inspection operations due to pipe defects or human errors; and 3) standardize municipal utilities? practices in managing sewer condition data using blockchain-enabled technologies.

Further, many sources emphasize the high efficacy rates for the three vaccines with FDA or FDA EUA status in the United States. For example, the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine boasts an efficacy rate of 95% against the original strain of the COVID-19 virus, meaning that over the duration of a 3-month period in which 1% of the population without the vaccine contracted COVID-19, we could expect about 0.05% of vaccinated people to contract COVID-19 (95% lower). However, many lay people may not understand how vaccine efficacy rates are computed, and the 95% efficacy rate could be misunderstood to mean that 95% of vaccinated people will be protected from disease, implying that 5% of vaccinated people will become diseased with COVID-19. This project examines how lay people (such as patients) use health-related numerical information, sheds light on the basic cognitive processes underlying misuse of vaccine efficacy numbers and speaks to the broader question of how to present numerical health information in a way that lay people can understand and effectively use. The research identifies the degree to which different facets of cognitive processing (e.g., knowing how to use the mathematical formula, understanding the concept of relative risk reduction, and engaging in deliberation or comparison processes) act as facilitators to providing the normative response. Findings from the proposed research have the potential to foster informed medical decision making and patient agency. Understanding how lay people understand vaccine efficacy is highly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic when conversations about vaccine efficacy receive increased attention and interest from patients.  Given the strong association between perceived vaccine efficacy and vaccination intention, it is critical to identify and correct misconceptions in patients? understanding of vaccine efficacy statistics.<br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic prompted widespread discussion of efficacy rates for COVID-19 vaccines in scientific journal articles and news media outlets, but little is known about how well lay people understand vaccine efficacy, which entails a fairly sophisticated mathematical calculation. This research tests the prediction that lay people are lured by a plausible and computationally simple but incorrect calculation: post-vaccination risk of infection = 1 - efficacy. For example, the lure response would be that after receiving a 95% effective vaccine a person has a 5% risk of getting infected. Previous medical decision-making research demonstrates that patients, especially those low in numeracy, often have difficulty understanding numerical information, which has a consequential impact on their health decisions and health outcomes. Moreover, prior cognition research provides evidence of quick, intuitive responses that may be analogous to the lure response in the vaccine efficacy context. This series of studies investigates the extent to which laypeople improperly interpret efficacy and whether this misunderstanding is associated with individual characteristics such as numeracy, cognitive reflection, and scientific literacy. First, hypothetical scenario experiments are employed to better understand how lay people utilize information about vaccine efficacy. Scenarios that vary information about fictitious vaccines illuminate the extent to which lay people improperly understand efficacy (for example, by answering that a vaccine that is 95% effective means that 5% of vaccinated people will get infected). Additional studies test a tutorial designed to improve viewers? conceptual understanding of vaccine efficacy. Two versions of the tutorial differ in their emphasis on the mathematical formula vs. the concept of relative risk reduction, enabling a test of which of these facets is the major barrier to normative responses. Final studies examine a debiasing method that prompts participants to make an implicit comparison of disease risk between untreated and treated groups, testing the hypothesis that misunderstandings about vaccine efficacy stem from a failure to consider a comparison between a placebo group and a vaccinated group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research suggests that students exhibit greater motivation and resilience to challenges when they believe that their intellectual abilities can improve. These students ultimately have better academic outcomes than those who believe their intellectual abilities are fixed. This project will design interventions to foster positive student beliefs. The interventions will be customized to the cultural and institutional context in which they will be implemented. This project will involve developing, implementing, and assessing the short-term and long-term psychological and academic outcomes of interventions to help undergraduate introductory biology students adopt more positive beliefs about their abilities. The interventions? effectiveness will be assessed using a new, high-quality measure of students? beliefs. This project will answer pressing research questions related to implementing interventions and the psychological theories underlying this work. The significance of this project will include advancing the understanding of psychological theory and improving educational outcomes for all students. Importantly, this project has potential to improve equity in academic outcomes by being especially beneficial for students who encounter additional barriers in higher education. These students include those who are first-generation college students and those from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, among other marginalized groups. <br/><br/>This project will address three of the most pressing research questions to advance the understanding of how mindset interventions could be used to improve student success and equity in science. The project?s research questions include: (1) How do mindset interventions at two different levels, student and instructor, affect student outcomes independently and in concert? (2) What are the mechanisms through which mindset interventions at both the student- and instructor-level influence students? experiences in the classroom, academic engagement, and academic outcomes in the short and long term? And (3) How do students? racial/ethnic identity and generation in college moderate any identified effects? These questions will be addressed by carrying out large-scale, fully-crossed, randomly-assigned field experiments in introductory biology courses at four sites (N>10,000 students). Growth mindset interventions have shown great potential to address large-scale educational inequities in logistically simple, cost-effective ways. This project will capitalize on this potential by investigating how mindset messages from instructors enhance the effectiveness of interventions at the undergraduate level. This work will not only have broad impacts by addressing social inequities to broaden participation in STEM, but will also have intellectual merit by generating a more nuanced understanding of how contextual messages moderate intervention effectiveness.

Developing sturdy and recyclable substitutes for single-use plastics will significantly reduce plastic waste. One way to reduce plastic waste is to develop self-healing ionic polymers that are resistant to permanent damage. Despite a massive amount of effort devoted to self-healing ionic polymer studies, the main mechanisms that yield optimal self-healing performance remain obscure. The goal of this fellowship is to provide an atomic-scale understanding of the self-healing mechanisms of ionic polymers. This aim will be achieved via a highly accurate large-scale accelerated molecular dynamics simulation technique developed at the host lab, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Such a technique will allow the PI and her graduate and undergraduate students to closely examine the interaction of ionic polymers to acquire a complete understanding of their self-healing process while also enhancing the research capabilities of the PI?s lab. Research concepts will be then delivered to a broader audience by incorporating research outcomes to the PI's undergraduate materials science class and communicating to the younger generation through public outreach programs. Results from this fellowship project will be published in journal articles and conferences, which will expand the public's awareness of the University of Vermont and enhance the university?s reputation. This fellowship will also strengthen the connection between the University of Vermont and Oak Ridge National Laboratory and will incite potential new collaborations between the two institutions in the future.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to obtain a clear and holistic atomic-scale understanding of the self-healing mechanisms of ionic polymers, aimed to enhance their self-healing performance. To achieve this overarching goal, the PI will establish a clear relationship between polymer and ion compositions and their self-healing performance based on atomistic modeling of polymer structure and dynamics. Atomic interactions and reactive dynamics will be investigated via an accurate and efficient methodology, i.e., the linear-scaling fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method based on long-range corrected (LC) density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) theory, which is highly suitable for studying ionic polymers. The physics-based understanding of the self-healing mechanisms for different ionic polymer compositions will accelerate high-performance materials selection, synthesis, and manufacturing for sustainable applications. As a byproduct, the dynamic information obtained via the FMO-LC-DFTB molecular dynamics simulations can be used to analyze their ionic transport properties, which are also of particular interest in flexible electronics. This proposed work will expand the PI?s scope of knowledge and skillset across various disciplines and will stimulate the research competitiveness in materials science studies at the University of Vermont.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanisms of dissolution are still an active area of research.  In most cases, particle dissolution involves three basic mechanisms: fluid and particle dynamics, mass transfer from a particle to the surrounding fluid, and particle erosion.  These three mechanisms are coupled, and they interact with each other through complex nonlinear relationships that are not completely understood.  In particular, the effect of hydrodynamics on dissolution arising from fluid-particle interactions has long been overlooked.  There is strong evidence that local shear flow enhances mass transfer from the particle surface to the surrounding fluid.  This ERI award comprises high-fidelity numerical simulations, high-precision experimental measurements, and novel machine learning techniques that together will help identify the critical role of flow in the dissolution of non-spherical particle systems.   <br/><br/>This ERI award will focus on 1) the coupling dynamics of fluid and particle motion, mass transfer of dissolved species, and surface erosion of prolate and oblate particles and irregularly shaped particles in simple shear flow; and 2) bridging the gap between microscale dynamics and macroscale descriptions of dissolution in suspensions of particles.  High-fidelity modeling of detailed microscale dynamics, including reduced-basis modeling of arbitrarily shaped particles, will be coupled to population balance modeling of the temporal evolution of particle size and shape at the macroscale.  The results of the research should provide guidance to actively control particle dissolution by adjusting flow shear rate and the initial distribution of particle size and geometry. The results could be applied in a wide array of applications including biological and chemical synthesis, renewable biomass energy, targeted drug delivery, degradation of biomaterials, and dissolvable microrobots.

Inspired by the emergence of spin glass and itinerant magnetism in Pr2Fe4Sb5, the magnetic and electrical properties of Ln2Fe4-xMxSb5 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Sm; M = Mn, Co, Zn) are also investigated. Compounds of this structure type are of particular interest because of the Fe-triangular subunits coupled with Sb-square nets, two features found in several highly correlated systems. Students involved in the proposed project will also have the opportunity to work with collaborators at other institutions and national laboratories. The principle investigator's entire research group is involved in mentoring students at different levels, including undergraduates throughout the academic year and high school students in the summer."

The coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific are centres of marine biodiversity, yet the natural resilience and biodiversity of these ecosystems are under great threat. Research at deeper depths (mesophotic coral ecosystems - MCEs; 30 to >150 m) reveal an unknown reservoir of biodiversity and natural resilience in the face of steep environmental gradients. Gorgonian octocorals typically dominate these dynamic environments yet are notoriously difficult to identify in the field and from morphological traits alone. Furthermore, molecular phylogenies have been largely unresolved, until the recent pioneering research of the project host at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), using target-capture genomics. This research will apply these novel genomic approaches to the PI?s rare and highly unique gorgonian collection from the mesophotic and shallow reefs of the Indo-Pacific that she has assembled over several years. Applying these novel genomic approaches to the PI?s collections will move beyond current analytical limitations and add transformative data and phylogenetic accuracy to the Cnidarian tree of life. This fellowship will assist the PI in building capacity at the University of Hawai?i at M?noa by passing on these critical and innovative skills, particularly to underrepresented minority students who are native to the locations of the samples themselves, and are passionate to conserve marine biodiversity of national and international concern.  <br/><br/>Gorgonian octocorals are an ecologically important, highly diverse yet poorly resolved group, where traditional markers have lacked phylogenetic resolution at the species and higher taxonomic level. Delimiting species and species boundaries across steep environmental clines are critically important in biodiversity assessments for conservation management particularly as the value of mesophotic ecosystems is increasingly recognised. Thus, we test the hypotheses that 1) the gorgonian fauna is distinct and more diverse at mesophotic depths, and 2) that morphotypes within the ubiquitous genus Annella Gray, 1858, are delimited by depth. This will be achieved using the target-capture genomic approach developed by the host, which simultaneously estimates the phylogenetic relationships between taxa over shallow and deep time, population structure within a species, and the delimitation of species boundaries. Using these methods will facilitate the development of a multi-trait (phenotypic and genomic) framework that will 1) assess the phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships within and between gorgonian taxa from shallow to mesophotic depths, and 2) present an exemplar case study of population structure and species delimitation in the widely distributed genus, Annella Gray, 1858. This work will develop a multi-trait (morphologic and genomic) framework to advance our understanding of a critically important coral group from some of the world?s most biodiverse yet critically endangered hotspots. This research will provide the opportunity for the PI and a female graduate assistant from a Pacific coastal nation, to learn these highly effective genomic techniques that are specific to corals, and disseminate the results formally (e.g., peer-review publication, MCE Gordon Research Conference) and informally (e.g., social media platforms).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Until recently, humans were physically separated from robots to prevent injuries and fatalities. Modern robotics focuses on humans and collaborative robotic systems working together on the same tasks. A safety hazard in such interactive environments is the occurrence of human errors. It is critical that safety conscious responses be programmed into collaborative robotic systems to guarantee safe behavior even when tasks or environments change. This project will develop a new algorithmic framework for safety assurance of autonomous robotic systems that aims for optimal performance when safety can be managed, anticipates and compensates for inevitable failures when it cannot, and learns from past mistakes. This framework will increase trustworthiness of autonomous systems while minimizing human efforts in deployment and maintenance, critical steps toward granting full autonomy to intelligent robots in uncertain and interactive environments, including such application domains as industrial robotics and autonomous driving. Through close integration of research and education, this project will contribute to new interdisciplinary training in robotics and autonomy, accessible dissemination of research in robot safety to the public, and opportunities for interactive learning through a remotely operated robotic platform. Partnerships with the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute, the Girls of Steel Robotics program, and the Choate Rosemary Hall college-preparatory school will be leveraged to provide opportunities for graduate student internships with small manufacturers and broaden participation in research of individuals from currently underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to a theory of cross-task safe guardians that augment existing hardware platforms without manual tuning, monitor and optimally modify their nominal task-oriented control actions to satisfy constraints representing safety requirements, and accomplish these objectives under time-varying uncertainty. It achieves this aim by investigating data-efficient model learning algorithms that accurately track the dynamics of an interactive environment, as well as by designing adaptive controllers that safely adjust the control strategy according to newly learned dynamic models. A responsibility-based evolutionary adversarial learning approach is developed to enable the adaptive safe control algorithm to achieve optimal performance given limits on available resources. Evaluation of the safe guardian and intelligent optimizer approaches is achieved in simulation and experimentally using autonomous vehicles interacting with human-operated vehicles in different traffic conditions, as well as in space-sharing applications involving robot arm manipulators and other human or robotic agents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Great improvements have been made in reducing the amount of expensive noble metals needed for high-performance.  Nevertheless, significant opportunity exists for further improving fuel cell/electrolyzer performance through optimization of the interface between the catalyst and the ion-conducting medium known as the ionomer.   The study utilizes state-of-the-art instrumentation, combined with a suite of electrochemical characterization methods, to gain unprecedented insight regarding the interfacial interactions between the catalyst layers and the ionomer.   The resulting fundamental insights regarding catalyst-ionomer interactions across a range of catalytic systems ? under conditions emulating device operation ? will translate directly to improved designs of durable, low-cost PEM fuel cells and other water electrolyzer systems.  The study involves a set of interconnected research and educational goals, both aimed at expanding knowledge of electrochemical devices, ensuring a highly trained future workforce, and highlighting the importance of renewable energy to the broader public.<br/><br/>The project will develop fundamental understanding of catalyst-ionomer interfaces and interactions, determine the effects of catalyst and support chemistry and morphology on these interfaces and interactions, and track evolution of interfacial structure and composition under sustained electrochemical reaction. The project will also establish best practices and protocols for PEM catalyst layer surface studies that can be applied to other systems. A variety of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments under in situ conditions, in conjunction with complementary characterization, will investigate the evolution of both catalyst-ionomer interactions and interfaces during exposure to relevant conditions for three material sets of increasing complexity: 1) ionomer thin films, 2) catalyst-ionomer composites, and 3) integrated electrodes.  The resulting insights will guide future work in designing novel catalyst systems and electrodes with optimized surfaces and interfaces as well as improved performance and durability. Knowledge obtained from this project will be disseminated to a wide audience through publications, participation in workshops and conferences, and close interactions with scientists from academia, national labs, and industry. The investigator will contribute to the education of STEM teachers through the AVS Science Educators workshop (SEW) and through the Summer Workshop on Energy Education for Teachers (SWEET) program at the investigator?s institution.

Cell culture, in which scientists attempt to grow cells in conditions like those in the body, is one of the most useful techniques in biomedical research. However, oxygen, a critical factor for cell behavior and physiology, is not controlled during standard cell cultures. In fact, cells in laboratory cell culture experience up to 50-fold higher oxygen concentrations than they do in the body. By changing the status quo of cell culture from non-oxygen-controlled to oxygen-controlled, the proposed technology can advance the scientific understanding of oxygen?s role in disease development, biological processes, and human tissues. In addition, the technology can improve human health by (i) fueling the discovery of new drugs and drug targets, (ii) improving the accuracy of the drug screening process, reducing the attrition rate, cost and time spent on failed drugs, and (iii) accelerating the commercialization of cell-based therapies for cancer treatment and regenerative medicine. <br/><br/>The proposed project will develop the Oxygen-Controlling Cell Culture (OCC) system, an enzyme-based approach adaptable to the vessels already in use for cell culture.  Unlike current oxygen-controlling products that function by reducing oxygen in the gas phase surrounding cell culture vessels, the OCC system takes an innovative approach by harnessing enzymes to locally control oxygen concentration directly in the cellular environment. This approach improves data accuracy, consistency, and reproducibility. The OCC system will be developed by testing a number of strategies to chemically attach enzymes to cell culture vessels. The oxygen concentration will be tuned to specific values by controlling the enzymatic depletion rates and oxygen transfer rates within the vessels. System performance will be validated by examining the impact on stem cells and cancer cell behavior and physiology. Through this proposal, it is anticipated that an OCC system prototype will be ready for the next stage of commercialization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the amount of data created over the next three years is predicted to be more than that created over the past 30 years. Without significant technological advances, existing communications infrastructure will not be able to cope with this exponential increase. This project addresses this challenge by exploring how such data can be compressed over networks to significantly reduce the traffic that needs to be transmitted. The main idea is to explore new data-compression schemes that leverage untapped gains by exploiting similarities and structure in the data as well as how the devices are connected in the network. Examples include transmitting many related measurements in different locations of the power grid to a single destination, or transmitting a video replay to the individual devices of a large crowd in a sports stadium. As such, the proposed research promises to provide a significant transformative impact on many critical applications employing reliable networked data compression, for example in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, and finance. The project also includes an integrated education plan to increase participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This objective is supported by several complementary initiatives, including targeted K-12 activities as well as related teacher training and mentoring.<br/><br/>The proposed research significantly advances the state of the art in network data compression by employing ideas from network coding, graph theory, iterative information processing, machine learning, and circuit design. The project involves several fundamental themes related to network-aware, low-complexity, and throughput-efficient data compression schemes which are not present in previous studies: a theoretical analysis and design of general schemes for lossy source coding, involving a characterization of finite-length scaling properties under message passing encoding and analysis of harmful graphical substructures; an investigation of the fundamental rate-distortion performance of nested graph-based codes in canonical network structures, exploring the achievable network gains in compression for practical spatially coupled constructions; and algorithmic advances and novel high-speed field programmable gate array hardware architectures.

They play a central role in the transport of sediment in lakes, rivers, and oceans, and they are also important in emerging and potentially transformative technologies such as deep-sea mining and geoengineering. Despite a rich history of research on gravity currents, some fundamental scenarios have yet to be explored or remain substantially unresolved. This collaborative project will integrate analytical modeling, numerical simulation and laboratory experimentation with a unique field experimental data set to advance understanding of particle-laden gravity currents. This project has potential for transformative impacts by informing environmental regulations for such emerging industries as deep-sea mining. Deep-sea mining is expected to re-suspend large volumes of sediment in the pristine abyssal ocean environment, and the knowledge and models developed through this project will provide the toolbox needed to assess the evolution of these sediment plumes.  The project will provide training for university students at all academic levels and for high-school students who will participate in the project through established programs at MIT and UCSB.  <br/><br/>The project is divided into three interconnected topics. The first concerns the evolution of gravity and particle-driven currents released from a moving source. The goals are to understand how the ratio of source speed to buoyancy velocity influences the dynamics of the current, investigate the role of background current, and develop empirical models that predict transport processes. The second point of focus is to quantify sediment detrainment from polydisperse particle-driven currents and determine its sensitivity to the particle size and velocity distribution through concurrent laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Empirical models of polydisperse particle-driven currents will be extended to include entrainment and detrainment and incorporated into the moving source gravity current model. Finally, the role of flocculation and aggregation of particles on the propagation of polydisperse particle-driven currents will be experimentally investigated by systematically varying the sediment?s history, with the goal of developing macroscale numerical models for flocculation and integrating the findings into the moving source model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When powered by sustainable electricity from sources such as wind power or solar energy, electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) technology potentially offers a negative carbon emission route to chemical manufacturing.   Current eCO2RR technology is limited, however, by dependence on expensive noble metal catalyst materials, energy losses in the electrocatalytic reactions, inefficient conversion of CO2 to targeted products, and low rates of CO2 capture and transfer to the working catalyst surface.  The project addresses those technology gaps through research aimed at developing an effective catalytic system based on a low-cost transition metal phosphide (TMPs) class of materials modified with a chemical compound (imidazolium (Im)) that enhances the transfer of CO2 to the catalyst surface.  Together the two components promote the capture and conversion of waste CO2 to ethanol for use in downstream fuel and chemical applications.  Beyond the technical aspects, the project supports educational and research programs educating future leaders in technology related to clean energy and sustainability.    <br/><br/>The project is built on the hypothesis that imidazolium-functionalized TMP catalysts can tailor the electronic properties of surface metal atoms to promote carbon-carbon coupling for high rate ethanol production. The project employs a systematic approach, combining experimental and computational studies to design and validate different components of the Im-TMP catalytic system, and to identify key factors that play crucial roles in activity, selectivity, and stability of the proposed catalytic system. The project exploits existing collaborative relationships with the aim of establishing a novel catalytic system for electrosynthesis of ethanol from CO2 through directed experimental efforts in electrochemical testing and analysis. Various nanostructured TMP nanoparticles, with stoichiometry of MP (M: transition metal)and their Im-functionalized structure, will be characterized and evaluated.  The materials combinations are selected based on preliminary results from the investigators? research showing that imidazolium-functionalized molybdenum phosphide (Im-MoP) nanoparticles work as a unified system to produce ethanol. Crucial to the goal of this project, is the combination of cutting edge in-situ, ex-situ, atomic- and molecular-scale experiments with DFT calculations that will be performed to identify electronic and structural properties of TMP surface atoms and their interactions with imidazolium. This information will be utilized to develop electronic?structural?performance relationships of the Im-TMP catalysts.  The insights gained from the research will establish new methods for the development of advanced materials for other common electrocatalytic processes, such as nitrogen fixation, and the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, where functionalizing the surface of catalysts with organic molecules may show similar benefits. From the educational and outreach perspectives, the project will interface with the joint initiatives Program for Undergraduate Research Education (PURE) on the investigators? campus.  Additionally, the investigators will collaborate with Elizabeth City State University, a HBCU and public baccalaureate institution, to bring knowledge related to materials design, synthesis, and characterization for various electrochemical applications and provide research opportunities for students coming from under-represented groups, encouraging them to pursue advanced degrees in energy sciences.

Manufacturing contributes enormously to the U.S. and world economy, including through creation of high paying jobs.  This project intends to improve manufacturing education by helping undergraduate students develop a system view of manufacturing.  Successful delivery of a new product to market involves a series of steps that include design, construction, implementation, and management. Although companies understand this big picture, engineering and business graduates often fail to realize the connection between these key steps. This lack of understanding stems in part from the failure of undergraduate engineering and business education programs to connect these steps in their curricula. To address this gap, this project will develop learning modules for different stages of product development that will emphasize the inter-dependencies between the stages of the product life cycle.   Each learning module will include design, process, system, and business components and feature modeling, simulation-based learning, virtual reality, and hands-on experiences.   These modules will be integrated into engineering (industrial, mechanical, and electrical) and business (management information science) courses.  It is expected that this approach will enable students to better understand product manufacturing as an interdependent system, as well as improve problem-solving and decision-making skills. <br/><br/>The project has three specific aims: 1) Design a set of cohesive learning modules that introduce key manufacturing stages, from product design to information systems;  2) Cultivate students? system thinking skills as they simulate the complete product cycle, and critique and reflect on product design to remove downstream constraints; and 3) Use simulation and modeling activities to help students recognize and engage in interdisciplinary collaboration that leads to development of professional skills.  Product design will focus on graphical, analytical. and computer modeling of a new product (a bicycle), taking into consideration aesthetics, ergonomics, dynamics, and mechanical properties. Based on their product design, students will select manufacturing materials and processes to successfully produce the components that make up the product. They will then model a manufacturing system comprised of the required technology and labor. Finally, they will use information systems, including a modern Enterprise Resource Planning system, to demonstrate how to manage and execute an integrated process to procure materials, manufacture components, and deliver the product to the end consumer. Following pilot testing and iterative refinement, the modules will be integrated into an interdisciplinary curriculum in project life cycle management. A quasi-experimental design will be used to investigate the impact of the new curriculum on the decision-making processes of students from diverse educational backgrounds. This project has the potential to educate future engineers who can apply advanced modeling methods and working with supporting information systems and technology, thus contributing to the quality of the nation?s STEM workforce.

Alongside regular services, current new offerings from cloud-service providers allow exploiting under-utilized virtual machines at a fraction of the original cost. Such computing resources, however, are highly heterogeneous and elastic. Heterogeneity means that virtual machines can have different computational speeds and storage constraints. Elasticity means that these virtual machines can be preempted under short notice (on the order of minutes) if a high-priority job appears; on the other hand, new virtual machines may be available over time to compensate for any shortage of computing resources. Such behavior can result in computational failure or significantly increase computing time. In response to the challenges of both heterogeneity and elasticity in cloud systems, this project will formulate new heterogeneous elastic computing frameworks, aiming for optimal and implementable solutions. The results of this project can lead to sizable economic benefits. The project's educational activities are designed to integrate research into teaching, and include mentoring both graduate and undergraduate students, alongside outreach programs to undergraduate and K-12 students with the goal of fostering interest in transformational computing technologies.

However, the extant works still suffer from the trade-off between mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, as well as the fundamental understanding of how those properties influence the performance of the assembled cells. This NSF EPSCoR RII Track-4:NSF fellowship project will provide an opportunity to collaborate with researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) to perform fundamental studies on hybrid electrolytes by integrating experimental and simulative efforts. The long-term collaboration is expected to improve the infrastructure in a sustainable way on the research capacity in the energy storage, high-performance computing, and education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) field. This project will also encourage underrepresented minorities to pursue science and engineering-related projects based on several programs on campus. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this EPSCoR RII Track-4:NSF fellowship project is to develop a new understanding of the coupling mechanism between the properties of the novel hybrid electrolytes and the electrochemical performance of the Li metal battery by elucidating the process-structure-performance correlation of the hybrid electrolytes quantitatively. By partnering with researchers at Caltech, density functional theory-based first-principles calculations and experimental studies will be integrated to fundamentally investigate the interaction of the components in the hybrid electrolytes as well as the interaction with the lithium salts to understand their effects on the performance of the hybrid electrolytes. Driven by the simulative studies, advanced manufacturing techniques will be developed to fabricate unique hybrid electrolytes with the nonisotropic and tailored nanostructure. It holds the great potential to break the trade-off between high mechanical properties and high ionic conductivity in hybrid solid electrolytes. That, in turn, will provide effective strategies for the energy storage community to design and fabricate hybrid electrolytes with desired properties for safe and high-performance Li metal batteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genes in bacteria are not only inherited from parent to offspring but can also transfer between different species. This ?horizontal gene transfer? is often caused by small genetic elements called conjugative plasmids. These plasmids carry the machinery to move copies of themselves into new bacterial cells. A gene on one of these plasmids can inhabit very different host cells over time. A mutation in this gene may then have different effects in each host. This means genes could evolve differently during parent offspring transmission than when they are transferred horizontally between species. This project combines mathematical models and experiments with different bacterial species to measure the effect of horizontal transfer on the evolution of an antibiotic resistance gene and determine how that influences adaptation to changing conditions.  Because antibiotic resistance genes are often located on these plasmids, this will aid in combating the evolution of drug resistance. Additional broader impacts include the development of learning tools and a new undergraduate course that will provide authentic research experiences for students. <br/><br/>This project has three research aims. First, the researchers will propagate communities with combinations of three bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and monitor the evolution of a plasmid-borne gene coding for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Horizontal gene transfer will be manipulated during this process to determine the role of transfer between species in evolution of drug resistance. Second, genetically engineered bacteria will be used to determine why certain mutational sets are favored during horizontal transfer. Mathematically modeling of the results will produce predictions about whether horizontal transfer speeds or hinders the evolution of drug resistance. Third, the researchers will build a computational model to incorporate more realistic features of microbial communities, including more complex environments, migration, and competition between different bacterial species. This model will be tested in live bacterial communities with horizontal transfer turned on or off through plasmid engineering. Overall, this project will elucidate the role that horizontal genetic inheritance plays in the evolution of bacterial communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to build trust in AI-enabled complex systems for safety-critical applications. This trust could be built by means of some offline or online validation processes. The drawback of online verification methods is that they require some form of real-world deployments which could be unsafe and risky. Typically, it is of great interest to reveal possible failure scenarios in a simulated environment before deploying an AI-based decision-making system into the real world. Since the space of failure events and corner cases is extensive in complex systems, the validation process might be very time-consuming as a huge number of experiments are required for safety validation. This project aims to develop approaches that capture information from multiple sources to significantly speed up the validation process and reduce the overall computational cost. Through the collaboration with the Stanford Center for AI Safety, the PI and graduate trainee will gain invaluable training opportunities that will help to build a strong STEM research and education partnership between West Virginia University (WVU) and Stanford.<br/><br/>The overarching objective of this project is to develop algorithms for safety validation of autonomous systems that reason about the safety behaviors of autonomous systems from multiple sources of information. The central philosophy behind this work is that a cyber-physical system (CPS) or a robot can query data from multiple sources, including different levels of granularity in simulation, offline or online real-world data, and/or human expert inputs. Currently, there is no rigorous mechanism to reason about the safety behaviors of a learning-enabled decision-making system that optimally considers data from different sources of information. This research will combine the decision making under uncertainty and formal methods expertise at the Stanford Center for AI Safety and the PI's expertise in machine learning and data-driven optimization techniques to arrive at safety validation frameworks that leverage data from multiple sources. The PI and his students will develop tools from data-driven optimization and reinforcement learning algorithms to identify failure events from multiple sources of information. The proposed algorithms will be applied to a suite of simulated environments for autonomous driving. This research will significantly extend the tools and open-source software for the safety validation of autonomous systems. Through collaboration with the Stanford Center for AI Safety, the PI will maintain ties between academia and industry, open new avenues for joint proposal writing, joint journal publications, and student exchange programs between Stanford and WVU. The proposal will be integrated into an educational plan that involves undergraduate and graduate students in research and enriches the curriculum of robotics and engineering at West Virginia University (WVU).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the one hand, policies that sanction and isolate these new regimes can lead to deprivation for civilians. On the other hand, the provision of economic and humanitarian aid to vulnerable civilians can stabilize such regimes. This project will gather and analyze new survey data on public opinion regarding these dilemmas of peace, security, and human rights in a post-conflict environment. The project will examine potential differences in public attitudes on peacebuilding and human rights by gender and ethnicity. The findings of this project will be of practical use to US national security policymakers in guiding a strategic approach to relations with new regimes in post-conflict countries. Additionally, the new surveys will help fill a data vacuum on the preferences of conflict-affected civilians, especially women, regarding international support and how to best address dilemmas of stabilization and peacebuilding in conflict-affected countries.<br/>  <br/>The project will field three public opinion surveys in a post-conflict country, using novel random domain intercept technology to collect random, secure, anonymous samples of public opinion of internet users. The multi-wave surveys will enable the testing of hypotheses in real-time on a) whether public views on human rights and peace and security differ between men and women and across different ethnic groups and geographical regions, and b) how attitudes shift as the domestic and international security situation evolves. The findings of this research will contribute to the scientific literatures on gender and security, public opinion on national security in developing countries, and domestic sources of support for human rights (including women?s rights) and peacebuilding in post-conflict countries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems, however, often require new building blocks that did not exist earlier. High-precision sampling from Gaussian distributions is one such time-consuming and critical building block that has to be implemented efficiently with customized hardware solutions. The statistical accuracy of the resulting solutions must be guaranteed to abide by cryptographic security requirements. Moreover, the developed solutions must be flexible enough to support multiple current and potential future applications. Existing hardware designs cannot meet these conditions. This project will address this problem by a cross-cutting approach on hardware design, algorithms, statistics, and cryptography. Successful completion of the proposed activity will be a significant step towards automated solutions for provably-secure sampler designs. The project will help workforce development in the area of hardware security in collaboration with several other universities. The results of the project will be made open-source and will potentially be made available to other agencies, e.g., NIST.<br/><br/>In this project, new sampler hardware designs will be developed to support lattice-based cryptographic systems such as those in post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic-encryption applications. Although sampling from uniform distributions has been thoroughly studied in the context of cryptography and other applications, there are significantly fewer works on sampling from non-uniform distributions such as the Gaussian distribution, which is unique to lattice-based cryptosystems. To that end, the project will first explore novel algorithmic approaches that simplify the random-search process used in Gaussian-sampling techniques. The project will then explore the approximation techniques that optimize the search while minimizing the impact on statistical deviations. Furthermore, the project will seek full design-automation solutions that can create optimized sampling hardware for a given set of parameters.

Since data driven discovery is a high priority across all areas of science and engineering education and research, future STEM professionals, including today?s students, will need to be able to gather and analyze data to solve problems. In order to help students to thrive in a data-intensive society, teachers themselves require opportunities to develop their own skills and understandings related to data science and scientific research. To meet this need, this project will engage prospective secondary STEM teachers in mentored summer research experiences related to biological applications of data science. Accompanying the research experiences will be a professional development program. This professional development program will be aimed at increasing pedagogical and content knowledge. It is also aimed at developing communication skills and incorporating enrichment experiences to illustrate and emphasize ways research can be applied to build prospective teachers' capacity to incorporate research and other inquiry-based learning in the classroom. By providing prospective teachers with firsthand research experiences involving data analytics, the project has potential to improve the quality of STEM teaching related to data science as well as to contribute to teachers? satisfaction and retention.<br/><br/>This project at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston includes collaborations with teacher preparation programs at University of Houston, University of Houston Clear Lake, and the Texas Education Agency Region 4 Service Center. The project will immerse six future secondary STEM teachers per year in authentic research experiences related to life sciences data mining and analysis, with a total of 18 participants over three years. The project has four fundamental goals. A primary project goal is for these prospective teachers to receive authentic research experiences involving a variety of data analytical approaches to investigate questions from neuroscience as well as molecular and cellular biology. A second goal is to incorporate accompanying professional development opportunities designed to expand the research experiences and to equip these perspective STEM teachers with the skills and understanding to bring research and professional development experiences to their future classrooms. A third goal is to evaluate the impact of project components on prospective teachers? growth and preparation. To meet the project's fourth goal, project outcomes will be disseminated to other investigators and institutions interested in improving and enhancing STEM pre-service teacher preparation. Project evaluation will include studying the impact of the research experiences and engagement in the professional development program on the participants, and will include information from completion of the project's curriculum, analysis of reflective journal entries, assessment of science identity and science teaching efficacy, and results emanating from continued engagement with partnering researchers and the host institution. Project results will be disseminated through communications with project collaborators, publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at local and national meetings, and web-based strategies.

There is a large body of research on how to automatically find vulnerabilities in programs, but test data for evaluation of this research--large, ground-truth corpora of vulnerabilities--are expensive to create and hence in short supply. The goal of this project is to create techniques for automatically generating benchmark corpora of software vulnerabilities that can be used to rigorously assess vulnerability discovery tools, allowing researchers and end users alike to better understand what techniques are most effective, leading to more effective tools and ultimately safer software. The project also aims to use automatically generated vulnerabilities to cheaply create training exercises for cybersecurity education, broadening access to cybersecurity expertise and helping to build the next generation of security researchers.<br/><br/>Although prior work such as LAVA (Large-Scale Automated Vulnerability Addition) has demonstrated that vulnerability corpora can be created automatically, the vulnerabilities it creates are unrealistic (containing many artifacts that made them easier to discover than real vulnerabilities) and not very diverse (consisting only of pointer corruption errors). This project aims to address these issues by developing new techniques that: 1) use large language models trained on code to synthesize vulnerabilities that are realistic and diverse; 2) place vulnerabilities in hard-to-discover paths through directed symbolic execution; 3) allow new vulnerability classes to be added quickly with a customized domain-specific language; and 4) automatically generate exploits for each vulnerability. Together, these techniques will allow highly realistic vulnerability corpora to be generated cheaply and on-demand. Aside from the benefits gained by having a limitless supply of vulnerabilities to use as benchmark corpora, the project will also investigate the use of vulnerability injection to create ""capture the flag""-style exercises for education; such challenges are an extremely popular and effective means of teaching a variety of cybersecurity skills, but they require large amounts of time, money, and expertise to create and manage. If the creation of these challenges can be partially or wholly automated, it could bring new educational opportunities within reach of a broader and more diverse population by dramatically lowering costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nitrogen oxide emissions are dominated by anthropogenic activities, typically associated with fossil-fuel combustion, which has dramatically declined across the US over the last several decades due to effective regulations.  Yet, atmospheric deposition of nitrate remains a significant environmental stressor.  Atmospheric chemistry transport models, which are commonly utilized to help guide policy, have difficulties reproducing observed atmospheric nitrate concentrations and deposition, resulting in unclear guidelines to improve existing Clean Air Act Secondary Standards. This disagreement may be related to complicated production mechanisms of atmospheric nitrate, requiring a deeper understanding of nitrate atmospheric chemistry to better predict the atmospheric burden of nitrogen deposition.  In this project, the PI will partner with scientists from the US EPA Research Triangle Park to evaluate and improve upon a commonly utilized atmospheric chemistry and transport model?s representation of atmospheric nitrate formation utilizing a novel oxygen isotope tracer technique (?17O).

Project outcomes will include establishing the first atmospheric chemistry and transport model at Brown University that will be utilized in future research projects by the PI and other collaborators at Brown, enhancing Rhode Island's research capabilities. <br/><br/>The oxygen stable isotopic composition (?17O) has been proven to provide quantitative observational constraints on the production mechanisms of atmospheric nitrate.  This is because key atmospheric oxidants have distinctive ?17O signatures (or ""fingerprints"") incorporated in the product nitrate derived from the oxidation of precursor nitrogen oxide emissions.  This work will evaluate the chemical representation of spatiotemporal atmospheric nitrate production in New England from 2005-2017 using the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ).  Model simulations will be conducted using a high-resolution US domain, and atmospheric nitrate formation pathways will be tagged and used to calculate the oxygen stable isotopic composition that quantitatively expresses nitrate production mechanisms.  The model output will be used to compare with detailed spatiotemporal ?17O observations of atmospheric nitrate in New England, leveraging detailed ?17O data from prior NSF support to test and improve upon atmospheric chemistry model representation of nitrate chemistry in New England.  The goals of this project include evaluating the chemical representation of the spatiotemporal formation of atmospheric nitrate and differences between nitric acid and particulate nitrate across the northeastern US during a period of significant reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions.  Ultimately, this project will lead to a better understanding of the role of emission reductions on the atmospheric cycle of nitrogen and its connection to atmospheric composition, air quality, and acid deposition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The global lithium-ion battery industry is growing at a tremendous rate due to the accelerated adoption of electric vehicles, robotics, and consumer electronics. Currently, a significant portion of innovation in the field of lithium-ion batteries and electrochemical energy storage solutions in general is focused around novel material chemistries and product designs. With the massive growth being witnessed in the industry, efforts to innovate production techniques must be undertaken to improve the entire supply chain.  By applying the targeted novel manufacturing method, the ability to fabricate higher energy density lithium-ion batteries at lower cost will improve the competitiveness of manufacturers, increase the competitiveness of advanced battery manufacturing in the global context, and open up new energy storage applications. This technology development seeks to promote a solution that advances the capability and sustainability of battery energy storage solutions, benefitting the lives of U.S. citizens and society globally. <br/><br/>A solvent-free manufacturing technology to produce electrodes for lithium-ion batteries is being developed. This technology provides the capability to fabricate thicker electrodes with finely tuned architecture and performance characteristics. The conventional methods for electrode manufacturing utilize slurry casting which requires energy intensive drying, hazardous solvents, and may leave a considerable environmental footprint. A continuous feed dry spraying system will be designed, manufactured, installed, and operated to optimize the process and product. The technology provides a method to fabricate thick electrodes which will increase the capacity and energy density of the lithium-ion batteries. In this project, ultra-high area capacity electrodes (cathode: ~5mAh/cm2, anode: ~5.5mAh/cm2) will be fabricated with the solvent-free manufacturing process. The high area capacity electrodes will enable high energy density (>300Wh/kg) by reducing the quantity of inactive materials (current collectors, separator, and casing).

(HRI). Science teachers serve a critically important public health function and become an important part of the nation?s response efforts. Since 2020, tens of thousands of science teachers in the United States have helped students grapple with the reality of SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19. This includes not only supporting the emergent scientific learning opportunities, but also functioning as public health educators and advocates in the midst of the global pandemic. HRI explored the early role of science teachers during the pandemic with a prior RAPID project, which demonstrated that science teachers were engaged in a wide variety of educational activities with students related to the pandemic and public health education. However, now nearly two years into the global pandemic, there are a number of new topics that have arisen to explore with respect to science education, including vaccines and long-term immunity that were not able to be assessed early in the pandemic. This study will further the field's understanding of the role that science teachers play in adapting their instruction during a public health crisis, how they address emergent ideas throughout the unfolding of the pandemic, and the impacts that the pandemic has had on science teachers themselves. <br/><br/>The research will build on the prior RAPID award (2027397) and return to the sample of science teachers studied in that context. HRI will collect survey data to explore the following questions: (1) How does the pandemic continue to influence teachers? science instruction (for example, instructional time, instructional strategies), and how has that influence shifted? (2) How has teaching about COVID evolved? What new topics (for example, vaccines) have they taken up in the<br/>context of COVID? (3) What factors now exert the greatest influence on science teachers? teaching about COVID, and how do those differ from the factors at play in the spring of 2020? (4) What are the impacts of the pandemic on science teachers themselves, including manageability of workload, opportunities for professional growth/development, physical/mental wellness, and job satisfaction?  Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, the survey will be constructed to identify factors that predict whether teachers take up the topic. The survey will also collect data about how teachers address the virus and its transmission with their students. HRI will disaggregate survey data by school-, class-, student-, and teacher-level variables to identify patterns in student opportunities. Survey data will be supplemented by interviews with 50 survey respondents to gather more in-depth information related to the constructs of interest. Study findings will be immediately shared through a preliminary report that focuses on the survey data; presentations and dissemination through practitioner and research organizations; and policy briefs to the CDC and NIH to acknowledge the role of science teachers as public health advocates and encouraging those agencies to make resources available to science teachers to support this role.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the DRK-12 program in the Division of Research on Learning. The Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through the research and development of new innovations and approaches. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for the projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These volcanoes arguably represent the largest geologic system in the Earth?s crust. By analyzing the lavas erupted at the MOR, geologists understand how these magmas are produced and how they chemically change as they rise to the surface.  However, less is understood about depths of formation and how that may change in different parts of the MOR system. New data on depth of formation of the crystals in MOR lavas, based on CO2 in trapped droplets of magma in crystals (melt inclusions), indicate that the crystals are produced over a wide depth range. Those crystals therefore provide a record of magma compositions encountered during transport from depth and of processes controlling ocean crust formation. This study will chemically analyze microscopic melt inclusions and crystals to understand how the depth of magma formation varies globally. This new data will provide information on the depth of crystallization in different MOR environments and the carbon budget of the mantle. A core aspect of this proposal involves outreach to students at the tribal colleges in South Dakota which will consist of three parts including current programs at South Dakota Mines, mentoring students from Oglala Lakota College (OLC), and providing advice on the development of the analytical facilities at OLC.<br/><br/><br/>Current understanding of the evolution of the ocean crust relies heavily on submarine volcanic glasses and, more recently, melt inclusion (MI) compositions. Such data is most informative about the complex array of mixing and differentiation processes active in the upper mantle and crust - in essence ?what? is happening.  What has been difficult to constrain is ?where? specific processes are active in terms of depth, making it challenging to resolve the influences of processes occurring in the melting regime versus those that occur during transport to the surface. New data on depth of entrapment for melt inclusions (based on CO2 saturation/concentration) indicate that much of the crystal cargo in ocean floor basalts, particularly those from plagioclase ultraphyric basalts (PUB) are the products of crystallization at a wide range of pressure. They therefore provide an opportunity to investigate how the array of magma compositions evolves during transport and how the distribution of energy and mass of the processes controlling ocean crust formation differs between tectonic settings (different spreading rates, magma supply, extent of melting, etc.). This study will conduct combined analysis by electron microprobe (for major element composition), Laser ICP-MS (trace element compositions), secondary ion mass spectrometry (glass CO2, H2O, S), and Raman spectroscopy (MI bubble density/composition). The samples selected represent a number of PUB lavas from a range of settings, on axis, pull apart basins, ultra-slow to intermediate spreading rates and from ridges characterized by different crustal thicknesses. This new information will improve understanding of a number of fundamental questions in MORB petrology including: 1) the comparative depth of crystallization in different MOR environments for olivine and plagioclase (how crystal sorting influence what is being sampled), 2) the depth dependence of the processes responsible for MOR differentiation, 3) the extent to which CO2/trace element ratios can be used to estimate the mantle C budget.

WSC is a four-year, rural, public college in located northeastern Nebraska. It is part of the Nebraska state college system and serves approximately 4,200 students. WSC's vision is to make a notable difference in rural and community life through learning excellence and student success. Following an aim of the Rural STEM Education Research Act passed by the House of Representatives in May, 2021, the project will be uniquely positioned to increase the capacity of rural northeastern Nebraska to provide quality STEM education and STEM workforce development programming to students. In particular, over its 6-year duration, this project will fund 4-year scholarships to 18 distinct talented, low-income students from rural communities (3 different cohorts of 6 students each) majoring in biology, chemistry, or mathematics. In addition to financial support, students will be provided with comprehensive curricular and co-curricular support opportunities aimed at reducing and removing barriers to STEM success and degree completion. At the initial stage, students will be able to attend a ?Succeeding in the Sciences Week? prior to the start of their freshman year to prepare them for the rigors of a STEM education and begin to build a sense of community among their cohort scholar group. Additional support opportunities will include community volunteering, faculty mentoring, internships, on campus living for 2 years, participation and presentations at scientific conferences, special career counseling, supplemental instruction, and faculty mentoring to help students identify and conduct research projects. As another component of the project, faculty will be able to attend a Faculty Mobile Summer Institute, which will provide training in evidence-based teaching methods. Project investigators will disseminate outcomes and findings related to project challenges and successes, especially to other small public rural institutions striving to support low-income STEM students.<br/><br/>To increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need, the project will pursue several goals. First is to remove financial barriers and to adapt, implement, and analyze a comprehensive set of evidence-based strategies to build capacity to support, retain, and graduate the project's rural biology, chemistry, and mathematics scholars. Second is to enhance the regional STEM workforce by providing special career preparation opportunities for students to prepare them to contribute through employment or pursuit of advanced degrees. Third is to contribute to the knowledge base by implementing, testing, and studying through project evaluation strategies for systematically supporting student academic and career pathways in STEM. And fourth is to disseminate outcomes and findings related to the supports and interventions that promote student success to other institutions working to support talented, low-income STEM students. Aimed at addressing the goals, project evaluation is designed to employ qualitative and quantitative methods to provide insights into the efficacy of project strategies to provide formative and summative feedback to the project and to identify the effective ones for replication, especially in other rural settings.

It has several negative effects on drag and lift that are critical to energy consumption and emissions, aircraft maneuverability, turbine noise, and vibration, etc. The proposed research is motivated by the observation that dermal denticles (tough scales) on shark skin show promising performance in reducing hydrodynamic drag. The ability of sharks? unique skin in the fish world to dynamically respond to the flow offers a significant performance advantage over current flow control techniques. This fellowship aims at gaining a new fundamental understanding of the causal mechanisms associated with the drag reduction role of shark skin denticles and simultaneously advancing current numerical models for routine industrial design. With the support of an EPSCoR RII Track-4:NSF Fellowship, the PI will learn to simulate and analyze fluid-structure interactions and develop new models for numerical predictive tools through the training at the Center for Turbulence Research (CTR) at Stanford University. The fellowship will strengthen collaboration between the University of Mississippi and Stanford, and promote new economic development opportunities related to aeronautics, aerospace, and naval industries in the mid-south and in the State of Mississippi.<br/><br/>The elastic anchoring of shark denticles enables them to bristle when subjected to the reversing separated flow that occurs at the onset of separation, thus hindering local separation. When flow is attached, denticles return to the non-bristled position and form a riblet-like texture to reduce friction drag. This motion leads to a flow-dependent anisotropic (or directional) function of the denticles that indicates a passive, flow-activated separation control technique. Current approaches, designed for stationary surface roughness, are insufficient to understand or predict the complex flows modulated by movable microstructures. The overarching goal of this fellowship is to support the PI?s training and collaborative research at the CTR. The training and research will focus on the cutting-edge fluid-structure interaction simulation methods and the development and validation of a novel wall model for the prediction of complex effects represented by surface microstructures. Specific objectives include: (i) to generate an unprecedented dataset of flows over movable anisotropic microstructures, (ii) to gain a new fundamental understanding about non-linear interactions, (iii) to synthesize the understanding to develop truly predictive models for drag and momentum flux. This RII Track-4:NSF fellowship will expand the PI?s research capacity and transform his career path towards a promising direction in the fluid-solid multi-physics system and reduced-order model development. The unique flow control techniques achieved by the flow-dependent anisotropic microstructure will be highly transformative to many other research areas in aerospace, agricultural, biomedical, energy, and environmental engineering where the application of structures with directional function is needed for the flow control process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on calcification responses and behavioral impairments of shoreline animals under altered seawater chemistry, and forefronts a common mussel species (the California mussel), and a common snail (the black turban snail), each abundant on rocky shores along the west coast of North America. The target species operate as exemplar organisms for characterizing the responses of marine invertebrates more generally. Methods involve experimental decoupling of multiple components of the carbonate system of seawater to isolate drivers that are difficult to separate otherwise. Broader impacts include transfer of scientific information to policy-makers, including legislators, as well as training and skill-set development of future generations of scientists and citizens. One Ph.D. student is supported, as are UC Davis undergraduates conducting mentored research. The project also provides research internships for undergraduates from a local community college (Santa Rosa Junior College), many of whom are from underrepresented groups. The latter project component substantially bolsters an ongoing program at Bodega Marine Laboratory that includes efforts in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Data and interpretations from the project are feeding into an existing educational program that links to local K-12 schools and reaches ~10,000 members of the public each year.<br/><br/>Overall, the research of the project is dissecting drivers of calcification and behavioral disruption in key shoreline invertebrates, across present-day and future carbonate system conditions appropriate to coastal marine environments. Efforts are exploring the extent to which calcification depends on one versus multiple parameters of the seawater carbonate system. In particular, existing conceptual models emphasize the importance of calcium carbonate saturation state (?) and/or the ratio of bicarbonate to hydrogen ion concentrations ([HCO3-]/[H+]), and the project is examining these mechanisms as well as the possibility that more than one driver acts simultaneously. It is doing so both in bivalves and in gastropods to test for generality across molluscs. The project is additionally examining whether pH is the only carbonate system factor contributing to known patterns of behavioral impairment in marine invertebrates. Leading explanations for debilitating behaviors induced by ocean acidification involve altered ion channel function, but discussion in the literature continues, and studies that explicitly decouple the carbonate system are necessary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For some applications, their thickness needs to be less than the size of a polymer molecule. However, films with such thickness can have substantially different material properties relative to their bulk analogs. Understanding the fundamental structure-property relationship of polymer thin films is crucial for enabling their rational design. In this project, the PI and a female graduate student from the University of Southern Mississippi will work with experts at Rice University. The team will directly elucidate how nanoscale confinement alters polymer chain microstructures, mobility, and system heterogeneity through advanced optical imaging methods. This project will strengthen single-molecule imaging capabilities in the PI?s group and develop new collaborations between institutions. These resources will be leveraged to improve the research infrastructures in Mississippi, as well as to develop new course and workshop materials for educating future STEM researchers and enhancing community outreach. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this RII Track-4 fellowship project is to obtain a complete, molecular-level understanding about thin film confinement effects on polymer chain dynamics and conformations through real-space, real-time imaging. Specifically, single-particle tracking (SPT) and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (sm-FRET) methods will be employed for characterizing polymer mobility and their end-to-end distances as functions of film thickness and matrix molecular weight. Both imaging techniques are uniquely suited for simultaneously examining hundreds of individual molecules. The combined use of SPT and sm-FRET in this project will elucidate heterogenous chain behaviors of polymer thin films, which are particularly important for informing their efficient system design. Furthermore, this fellowship program will establish a platform to advance optical imaging capabilities in the PI?s home institution and the state of Mississippi.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key innovation of Rust is to rule out memory bugs and concurrency bugs through strict safety checks during compilation, while keeping the runtime performance of its compiled programs as good as C programs. Rust's popularity is increasing significantly these years and has already been adopted to build many safety-critical software systems. Unfortunately, Rust is known to have a steep learning curve and its safety checks cannot capture all bugs. This project will address these limitations by improving Rust's programmability and strengthening its post-compilation testing. The completion of the project will advance the state of the art in Rust learning and programming and further secure the ecosystem of Rust. The project team will also use the work to design new courses on software security and programming languages and to explore novel approaches to teach new programming languages. <br/> <br/>This project aims to enhance Rust's toolchain by answering two research questions. First, Rust's safety mechanism is unique, and the related grammar and semantics are different from traditional programming languages. Thus, programmers can easily write code violating Rust's safety checks and be rejected by the Rust compiler. How can one identify and resolve the programming difficulties incurred by the safety checks? Second, Rust leverages LLVM as its backend, and thus many existing dynamic techniques invented for C/C++ can be applied to Rust programs to capture bugs missed by the safety checks. How can one improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing techniques when reusing them to Rust programs?  Specifically, the project team will (1) identify programming challenges caused by the safety checks and resolve the challenges using novel visualization techniques, (2) improve the effectiveness of existing testing input generation techniques, (3) accelerate existing dynamic bug-detection and failure-diagnosis techniques,  and (4) build automated bug-fixing techniques for bugs detected by the safety checks and dynamic bug-detection techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Human-caused warming increases the ?dryness? of the atmosphere and, all other things being equal, increases evaporation rates from plant and soil surfaces, which in turn increases the loss of soil moisture and worsens naturally occurring precipitation deficits. Drought reduces the photosynthesis and productivity of plants, including in both natural and agricultural ecosystems, but the extent to which human-caused ecological change has amplified the effects of drought on plant productivity still remains unclear. This EPSCoR RII Track-4:NSF Fellowship will combine state-of-the-art satellite and ground-based plant observations with observed and modeled climate data to examine how much the past century of climate change has worsened drought effects on plants, focusing specifically on the relative contributions of natural- vs. human-caused effects during two recent severe droughts: the 2012-2015 California drought and the 2012 Midwest drought. The project will improve our understanding of the extent to which the effects of drought on Earth?s ecosystems are amplified by climate change, and it will also improve educational outcomes through training of a postdoctoral researcher and development of new climate change-related laboratory exercises for courses at the University of Iowa.<br/><br/>Droughts are among the world?s costliest natural disasters, causing severe damage to both social and ecological systems. Anthropogenic warming exacerbates natural precipitation deficits through heat-induced increases in evaporative demand, which further dries soils and stresses vegetation. Anthropogenic increases in the frequency and severity of droughts likely exert large, but still poorly constrained, impacts on ecosystem function, including photosynthesis and growth of plants (?primary production?). While drought clearly reduces vegetation health and primary production, the relative contributions of natural variability and anthropogenic forcing remain unknown. Using the severe 2012-2015 California and 2012 Midwest droughts as case studies, this project will quantify the proportion of drought-induced primary production loss that was directly attributable to anthropogenic climate change, including attribution to specific climatic drivers (temperature, vapor pressure deficit, soil moisture, and solar radiation). The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that anthropogenic contributions to drought-induced loss of primary production were even greater than anthropogenic contributions to loss of soil moisture due to the direct negative effects of higher temperatures and evaporative demand on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis. This hypothesis will be tested using state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques (e.g., solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence) and climate change attribution methods. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop an empirical ?global change ecology? attribution framework that will be portable to other ecological systems and other impacts of climate change, including follow-up work focused on the effects of climate change on nationwide changes in primary production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It can be used to implement algorithms in graph analytics, deductive databases, program analysis, satisfiability, constraint solving, and machine learning. High-performance RA has the potential to extract vast untapped parallelism from critical applications. Despite this great expressive power, investigation of RA within the HPC community has been limited and significant advances are needed to scale RA on next-generation HPC systems. This work will advance the state of art by developing novel algorithms for massively parallel relational algebra on exascale HPC systems such as the Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). In the context of heterogeneous systems (i.e., those using multiple distinct compute paradigms in concert, like Aurora), this work will address key scaling concerns including workload decomposition, load balancing, communication, and I/O. This work will establish foundations for long-term collaboration with ANL towards the development of foundational theory, practical implementations, and rigorous evaluations of parallel RA. The project will support a graduate student from an underrepresented minority and lay groundwork for a high-impact dissertation.<br/><br/>Owing to increasing inter-network data-movement costs and power constraints, exascale systems are increasingly shifting toward heterogeneous computing environments, with CPUs being coupled with coprocessors such as GPUs. Aurora Supercomputer at Argonne national lab is an example of a leadership-class heterogeneous system; every Aurora node is equipped with multiple GPU co-processors. This work will lead to the development of parallel algorithms for RA, in the context of Aurora specifically and heterogeneous systems more broadly, over three key phases: (1) development of core RA algorithms for multi-GPU nodes; (2) extending these algorithms to supercomputers with many nodes, like Aurora; (3) extending the whole compute process to include scalable parallel IO. First, phase (1) will require investigating three technical approaches for the RA itself, extending them to multi-GPU nodes: (i) radix-hash, (ii) sort-merge, and (iii) nested-loop. Second, in phase (2) the work will investigate inter-node balancing of RA primitives and techniques to minimize data movement across multi-node systems. Finally, in phase (3) a customized parallel IO system and storage model will be developed that will take into account the deepening memory hierarchy available on modern supercomputers. These innovations across three phases will be evaluated using the ALCF supercomputer Aurora, using three application domains: graph mining, static program analysis, and deductive databases for scientific simulations. With exascale insight, this research is poised to create a new generation of applications based on relational algebra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is one of the active lines of bioinformatics research currently. Pan-genome collections may be represented as high-scoring Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) data, indexed text data, or the more popular graph-based representations (pan-genome graphs). One of the fundamental objectives of these models is to support read mapping queries efficiently. To that end, this research will lead to a new class of string/graph algorithms for the analysis of pan-genomic data that are closely tied to critical applications that have the potential to make a lasting impact on the theory and practice of data-driven bioinformatics. The key findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed conferences, journals, and workshop tutorials. Several Ph.D. and Master's theses will also evolve from this research.

Additionally, some fundamental computational biology problems, like the Multiple Sequence Alignment, will be revisited in the context of pan-genomics for faster approximations and better heuristics. A deeper investigation on popular heuristics like co-linear chaining is another direction. The goal here is to provide solid mathematical reasoning on why such methods work well in practice.

It recognizes the importance of early academic career development and emphasizes the importance of the link between research and education. It is fairly recent that CAREER awards have been made in the area of broadening participation in engineering, with many of the awardees being involved in engineering education research. It is imperative that the results of research in this area be broadly shared with both practitioners and other researchers in order to reap the full benefits of the research outcomes. Conferences are a much quicker and more frequent venue, often showcasing not just completed efforts but also works in progress. The benefit to the researcher is the opportunity to network and obtain valuable feedback on their work, while the practitioner gains knowledge of evidenced based practices that they can utilize in their current work.  The CoNECD Conference will host a panel of CAREER awardees in the area of broadening participation. This presents an opportunity for four early career faculty to showcase their work to an audience of researchers and practitioners. The panel host is a CAREER award recipient and an assistant professor of engineering education at Virginia Tech.  <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The research conducted by these NSF CAREER awardees is vital for those concerned with the lack of diversity in engineering and computing fields. To reach its full potential, it is necessary for research results to be shared with practitioners who can then tailor their programmatic efforts using evidence-based outcomes that are grounded in current literature. As opposed to relying on anecdotal evidence of activities that have been successful, practitioners can utilize the CAREER research results to better inform their efforts. The panel will aid in the dissemination of NSF funded research directly to the community that needs it.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The CoNECD Conference is the only conference that focuses on broadening participation of all groups underrepresented in engineering. CoNECD provides a forum for exploring current research and practices to enhance diversity and inclusion of all underrepresented populations in the engineering and computing professions including gender identity and expression, race and ethnicity, disability, veterans, LGBTQ+, 1st generation and socio-economic status.

However, widespread adoption of hydrogen fuels is limited, in part, by the inability to safely store and transport hydrogen gas outside of carefully controlled industrial environments. This project will study an intriguing chemical phenomenon called the ""molecular corking effect,"" which may prove useful as a hydrogen gas storage mechanism. The molecular corking effect has been observed when hydrogen gas (diatomic hydrogen or H2) interacts with a class of materials called single-atom alloys. Single-atom alloys consist of a relatively inert noble metal surface interspersed with single atoms of catalytically-active metals such as platinum and palladium. When diatomic hydrogen gas contacts the single-atom alloy, the bond between the two hydrogen atoms is broken by the catalytically-active metal. The individual hydrogen atoms then spill over on the inert metal surface. A ""cork"" molecule that preferentially binds to the catalytically-active metal can be added to prevent the hydrogen atoms from reforming gaseous hydrogen. Hydrogen can be safely stored in this manner until the temperature is increased to remove the cork molecule and release the hydrogen gas from the surface. Fundamental insights into the entire molecular corking process must be developed to fully realize the potential of single-atom alloy hydrogen storage. The research objectives of this project will examine how molecular corks interact with single-atom alloys and describe the chemical characteristics of effective molecular corks. The project also includes an education plan focused on preparing students to integrate computational chemistry and experimental research in their pursuit of chemical and physical knowledge. Self-contained educational materials will be developed such that any chemistry instructor, regardless of comfort with computational methods, can integrate computational chemistry modules into their curriculum. These materials, along with outreach activities at local high schools, will encourage the participation of students from primarily undergraduate institutions and other resource-limited environments in computational chemistry-driven research.<br/><br/>The goal of this project, led by Dr. Scott Simpson at St. Bonaventure University, is to explore the limits of the ""molecular corking effect"" to control hydrogen spillover on single-atom alloys. Diatomic hydrogen introduced to a palladium/copper or platinum/copper single-atom alloy will adsorb at the surface, where the hydrogen-hydrogen bond will be cleaved by the catalytically-active metal. The dissociated atomic hydrogen spills over on the noble metal surface. Subsequent selective adsorption of a poisoning ligand to the catalytically-active metal prevents the dissociated hydrogen from desorbing and reforming diatomic hydrogen. This ligand, thus, serves as a ""molecular cork"" until heat is applied to dissociate the ligand, liberating hydrogen gas from the surface. This phenomenon can potentially be leveraged in hydrogen storage applications. However, single-atom alloys are a relatively new class of materials, and the many factors governing the molecular corking effect are unknown. Accordingly, the research plan is designed to (1) generate fundamental knowledge of how molecular corks interact with surfaces, (2) explore the viability of various molecular corks for hydrogen storage, and (3) examine the impacts of molecular cork adsorption on single-atom alloys aggregation. State-of-the-art computational methods, including density functional theory calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, will be employed to reveal the molecular-level phenomena underlying hydrogen spillover and desorption from single-atom alloys. Experimental validation via scanning tunneling microscopy and temperature-programed desorption studies will be conducted through collaborations. The outcomes of this project have the potential to advance hydrogen storage technologies and will be broadly relevant to the interfacial engineering and heterogenous catalysis research communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is necessary to reduce battery pack cost-per-kWh from about $150/kWh in 2020-21 to under $100/kWh ($65-70/kWh for mainstream adoption in the US) to make electric vehicle manufacturing cost lower than that for internal combustion engine-based vehicles. Current lithium ion batteries are reaching their limit of energy density. As a result, next generation batteries must take advantage of new materials. Among the various choices, lithium metal provides the highest theoretical capacity and with a potential capacity of ~2x energy density at the cell level and ~2x lower cost compared to current lithium ion batteries. The global electric vehicle battery market is estimated to grow to about $100 billion in 2025. In addition, the energy storage services market is also expected to start growing rapidly during the next 5 years and beyond. This project improves lithium metal batteries.<br/><br/>The proposed project focuses on demonstrating lithium metal batteries using a thin film or a coating as a modulation layer on the lithium metal surface to achieve a stable, reliable reaction. A lithium surface is inherently unstable, which leads unintended reactions and structures. These can lead to inner short-circuit, early battery failure and safety hazard. Irregular reactions also cause part of the lithium metal to become inactive, leading to capacity decay and thermal runaway. By adjusting the local electrochemical process through lithium flux, the coating promotes uniform lithium surface reaction. This project aims to develop a scalable solvent-free, thermally-enhanced and field-assisted approach to engineer the ionic transport properties of the coating on lithium surface. The flexible coating acts to interact with the lithium surface by regulating how lithium ions pass through it. Subsequently the project will systematically test the performance of lithium metal batteries equipped with such solvent-free engineered interfaces. The proposed technology enhances the reliability of lithium metal batteries, and paves the way for their commercialization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While peripheral devices offer a ""Plug'n'Play"" solution to ease their usage in different scenarios, attacks from these devices are increasing due to their ""Trust-by-default"" treatment and direct interactions with the low-level parts of the target machines (e.g., operating systems). For instance, a USB drive found in the parking lot could take complete control of an industrial control system once plugged, while a Bluetooth speaker could intercept all the network traffic of a user's laptop once connected. This work aims to systematically improve peripheral security by discovering and reducing vulnerabilities that could enable peripheral attacks ahead of time, detecting malicious tampering within peripheral devices once connected, and responding to peripheral attacks timely with assurance.<br/><br/>This project seeks to address the broad research challenge of enabling a trustworthy and formally-verified peripheral ecosystem and designing next-gen secure peripheral devices and operating systems. Rather than targeting a specific peripheral attack, this project focuses on developing a model-guided and holistic approach for peripheral security in general, including both USB and Bluetooth, leveraging ?models? extracted from peripheral specifications and stack implementations as key prior knowledge, and covering the whole life cycle of peripheral security, including pre-attack, runtime, and post-attack stages. As such, model-guided fuzzing, debloating, and formal verification reduces the attack surface exposed to peripheral devices; model-based firmware analysis, fingerprinting, and authentication enables runtime integrity of peripheral devices; model-guided provenance, patching, and formal implementation allows for immediate and assured responding actions against peripheral attacks. This project will assess all these considerations within a combination of real-world applications (e.g., Android USB security) and specification enhancements (e.g., Bluetooth security and privacy), and generalize the knowledge for securing both peripheral devices and host machines across hardware, firmware, and software stacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Top-down behavioral interventions are used to reduce the transmission of pathogens when pharmaceutical treatments (e.g., drugs and vaccines) are not available. They are often designed to minimize movement and contacts and include school and workplace closures or event cancellations. In additionally, individuals may choose to temporarily change their behavior to reduce their risk of infection. Such individual changes are difficult to predict or measure, making it challenging to measure their effectiveness in reducing disease incidence and spread. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 prompted widespread county-level restrictions alongside individual behavioral changes, such as staying at home and wearing masks. Despite experiencing the same county level restrictions, university students experienced very high rates of COVID-19 per capita, while non-students reported very few COVID-19 cases per capita. In contrast, neither population experienced seasonal influenza during the first winter of COVID-19. By comparing behaviors and disease incidence in these population, this research will help plan and design more effective and efficient outbreak management strategies for re-emerging or novel pathogens. This project supports training of early-career scientists. <br/><br/>This study investigates the 1) uptake, 2) persistence over time, and 3) impact of top-down behavioral interventions and individual behavioral changes on COVID-19 and influenza incidence. By integrating passive and active data collection, researchers will quantify changes in behaviors in central Pennsylvania. Comparing behavioral changes during top-down interventions to other times helps disentangle mandated behavioral changes from individual choices. Longitudinal passive surveillance data will provide frequent measures of population-level movements before and after SARS-CoV-2 emerged. Traffic cameras will quantify vehicular and pedestrian traffic while mobile devices will provide proxy measures of total visits to points of interest, time spent outside the home, mixing between students and non-students, and so forth. This project also will longitudinally survey students (N=684) and non-students (N=1313) to measure individual adherence to top-down interventions and the voluntary adoption of other behavioral changes.

Thus, educators need tools for developing empathy in engineers. Yet, measuring empathy is challenging because it manifests uniquely in different contexts. To begin addressing the need for an engineering-specific measure of empathy, we developed and pilot-tested an assessment instrument. Our prior work suggested a need to improve how empathy is measured across all aspects of the design phases and to account for variation in empathy for distinct user groups. Thus, in this study, our primary objective is to refine this instrument and to ensure its validity, reliability, and fairness for assessing empathic formation in undergraduate engineering design across multiple contexts, design phases, and participants. We will integrate and account for these perspectives in the expansion of the instrument, thus ensuring that the instrument captures a diverse group of instructor perspectives and needs. Thus, this study will support a critical need for a valid tool for assessing empathy in engineering design.<br/><br/>Empathy can provide the ?spark of human concern for others,? thus bolstering efforts at integrating empathy into engineering curriculum and help students? empathic growth with and for users. Thus, a measure of empathy can help students care, understand, and help users in need. In this study, we will iterate on an instrument for assessing empathy with a diverse group of engineering design instructors to identify potential refinements of the instrument needed to improve its alignment with their contexts, collect student data to ensure potential instrument refinements that accurately represent student experiences, and design a revised instrument that accounts for these novel insights. We will test the revised instrument for validity via the triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data with a large sample of students. Finally, we will use the instrument to identify differences in empathic formation associated with various instructional design contexts and practices, thus generating new knowledge on best practices for promoting empathic formation in engineering design. Our team brings prior research in empathic design, distinct engineering backgrounds, and expertise in multiple research methodologies which will ensure research rigor and quality. Our collaborators are design educators and thus will help ensure the instrument is useful for engineering design courses across disciplines and across university sites. The advisory board includes experts in empathy, design, and psychometrics who will provide external evaluation and guidance to ensure that the instrument represents the state of the art of research on empathy in engineering design. By providing the community with this measure, we can facilitate the integration of empathy and assessment of empathy in engineering classroom contexts, which can positively impact the experience and retention of pro-socially motivated students in engineering programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One type of compartment is the chloroplast, which in addition to participating in photosynthesis, also generates signaling molecules that turn on genes in the nucleus, a process known as retrograde signaling. This Research Infrastructure Improvement RII Track-4 fellowship will investigate how chloroplast retrograde signaling in living cells operates during plant immunity, and how pathogens interfere with this process. This research requires advanced microscopy instruments available at the host institution, The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, where the research will be conducted. This research will provide training opportunities for a Hispanic female faculty and a Hispanic graduate student. The knowledge gained from this project will inform the development of strategies to enhance plant defense responses to control plant diseases and reduce their economic and societal impact. <br/><br/>Chloroplasts have emerged as important organelles in plant immunity, both as a source of defense signaling molecules, and as major regulators of defense responses. In response to pathogens, chloroplasts re-localize around the nucleus, presumably to facilitate retrograde signaling, a process by which signaling molecules originating in chloroplasts activate gene expression in the nucleus. While retrograde signaling has been recognized, it is not fully understood how it operates during plant immunity. The main goal of this fellowship is to dissect the cellular and regulatory events associated with chloroplast retrograde signaling during plant immunity by 1) delineating how bacterial pathogens with distinct lifestyles impact chloroplast dynamics, 2) characterizing the chloroplast-nuclear communication associated with plant defense responses, and 3) evaluating signal-dependent gene expression in situ. The research proposed requires advanced live-imaging technologies to monitor chloroplast dynamics and chloroplast-mediated responses after infection with bacterial pathogens. This research will provide deeper understanding of the cellular processes associated with plant immunity to enable guided strategies to control plant diseases.

This ability can also promote US energy independence while limiting the emission of greenhouse gases. However, the controlled conversion of these gases into basic building block chemicals is currently performed at high temperatures, promoting the long-term degradation of the catalyst. This project aims to understand how deactivation pathways can be prevented using a nonreducible thin-film over-layer that confines surface species to active sites and limits unwanted reactions. Understanding these processes is fundamental to the development of new, catalysts with increased stability that can lower reaction temperatures and decrease overall energy consumption. Specifically, the PI will partner with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to observe the formation and movement of reacting surface molecules and the impact of these phenomena on the evolving catalyst structure and its degradation. Additionally, this NSF EPSCoR RII Track-4 fellowship project provides hands-on training in state-of-the-art characterization tools. The skills developed during this project will be used to enhance the current suite of tools at Louisiana State University to probe other industrially relevant reactions that are important to the regional economy. <br/><br/>Utilizing CO2-based feedstocks impacts numerous industrially relevant chemical processes, such as dry reforming of methane. To maximize conversion, catalysts are engineered for high surface areas and metal site dispersions. However, the reaction conditions needed to overcome thermodynamic equilibrium limitations result in the instability of catalyst structures prone to coking and undesirable side reactions. The mechanisms behind metal ripening and their subsequent effects are poorly understood, and in some studies, large changes in metal dispersion can have little effect on catalyst performance. The PI hypothesizes that metal clusters deposited on a catalyst substrate can be stabilized using a porous, nonreducible thin film to limit metal surface diffusion and growth and adsorbate spillover. Limiting substrate/metal ripening reduces coke-derived deactivation and maintains high metal dispersions responsible for the catalytic activity. This hypothesis is based on recent literature, which shows that porous shell layers can withstand ripening at some conditions. The proposed work will be performed in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL), leveraging their in-operando characterization techniques and high-resolution aberration-corrected electron microscopes. Access to these unique capabilities will facilitate hands-on training with a superior electron microscope in preparation for LSU?s acquisitions of STEM, operando infrared, and chemisorption analyzers vital in understanding surface chemistry. This experience will strengthen the PIs research profile, specifically in the area of operando surface chemistry, and enable the study of other energy-intensive industrially relevant reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond providing financial support for at least 10 Interns and at least 27 Scholars, project goals include engaging prospective science teachers in a variety of high-impact practices to prepare them to be effective pedagogical and disciplinary experts. Interns will engage in structured experiences with one of several existing university partners in the local community.  As they complete their licensure program, Scholars will participate in the Culturally Responsive Teaching series each semester, mentor lower-level undergraduates, lead discussions in biweekly discipline-based education research journal club meetings, and complete a mentored senior project related to science education. Additionally, Scholars will have the opportunity to serve as learning assistants in general science courses and will assist with ongoing recruitment efforts of the next generation of teachers from local high schools. Induction support for Scholars moving into their first teaching assignments will include regular meetings for new teachers, opportunities to participate in teacher-researcher partnerships, and an invitation to continue involvement in journal clubs, summer programs and other project activities. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The electrical properties of organic materials are often controlled using additives called dopants. The PIs have developed dopant molecules that exhibit an unprecedented combination of ease of use and effectiveness. Recently they have discovered that exposure to light can increase the utility of these dopants still further, enabling them to be used with materials suitable for display applications for which few other dopants are effective. This research explores the possibilities and limitations of this approach using chemical synthesis of new dopants, electrical measurements, and device fabrication and testing. Research outcomes may lead to improved devices, particularly displays that require less power. The research provides graduate students with interdisciplinary training, affords case studies for inclusion in the PIs' lectures, and gives opportunities for the education and training of women and minorities by hosting summer students and encouraging application to graduate school, recruiting at minority-serving institutions and conferences, and through interactions with New Mexico Highlands University.<br/><br/>Technical: Controllable doping of organic semiconductors with molecular oxidants or reductants can greatly improve charge injection and conductivity in transistors (OFETs), as well as organic photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. Dimeric n-dopants offer an unprecedented combination of ambient stability and strong reducing ability. This research builds on the PIs' recent findings that UV or visible light can extend the effective strength of these dimers beyond their thermodynamic limit, enabling n-doping of OLED materials. The goal of the research is to understand the mechanism, scope, practicalities, and limitations of the photoactivation, through varying the semiconductor electron affinity and rigidity, developing both stronger and weaker dimeric n-dopants, and developing dimeric p-dopants. The approach includes dopant synthesis and characterization; reactivity and photoactivation studies; electron spectroscopy, electrical, and dopant-diffusion measurements; and OLED fabrication and testing. Broader technological impacts include facilitating OLEDs with low turn-on voltages, and simplification of OPV and OFET manufacture. Educational impacts include interdisciplinary training of research students in synthetic chemistry, physical characterization, and device work; incorporation of materials based on the research into lectures at the PIs' institutions and at New Mexico Highlands University (where students also determine crystal structures of new compounds); and opportunities for the education and training of women and minorities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Time-synchronized measurements can satisfy this need and ensure resilience of this critical infrastructure only if the fundamental concerns regarding limited sensor coverage, lack of data and model interpretability, and heavy online computational burden are successfully addressed. This NSF CAREER project aims to alleviate these concerns by combining recent advances in robust statistics and machine learning to enable accurate and fast time-synchronized estimation in power systems. The project will bring transformative change by bridging the gap between physics-based and data-driven modeling and ensuring creation of algorithms that adapt to the needs of the data and not vice-versa. The intellectual merits of the project lie in creating new mathematical techniques in convex programming, interval-theoretic learning, and distributed optimization. The broader impacts of the project include engaging high school students in intellectually stimulating yet fun problem-solving projects that will expose them to STEM concepts as well as creating a power system workforce that is knowledgeable about data-driven methods in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to explore a new class of optimization problems that are fundamental to time-synchronized parameter, tracking, and dynamic estimation, respectively, in power systems. The proposed research will make new discoveries in two areas: (1) Linear estimation: by creating robust techniques that account for unknown noise characteristics and/or bounded perturbations in both dependent and independent variables. (2) Severely ill-structured estimation: by producing fast, valid, physics-compliant solutions using Bayesian inference and machine learning for problems in which classical methods fail to provide a consistent answer. The methodological and theoretical outcomes of this project achieved through the cross-pollination of ideas from power systems, data science, information theory, and statistics, will significantly boost the use of time-synchronized measurements for operational decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The removal and recovery of M&M from wastewater is crucial to prevent environmental contamination and to develop a more sustainable use of resources. This project proposes to exploit the ability of microbes to transform toxic and water-soluble forms of M&M into non-toxic forms which can be recovered as value-added products (e.g., metallic nanoparticles that can have multiple applications). Under the concept of ""together is better"", we plan to use mixed microbial communities of fungi and bacteria (relatively unexplored communities) to develop bioreactor systems for metal- and metalloid- biotransformation processes; by increasing the number and diversity of partners in a microbial community we can create more resilient, tolerant, and stable communities with improved biotransformation processes compared to their individual counterparts. The proposed work will (i) provide key fundamental knowledge regarding microbial interactions between fungi and bacteria in mixed microbial communities, a topic of interest to better understand the microbial system in nature; and (ii) lay down the foundation for the development of improved systems for the removal and recovery of harmful M&M from waste streams, which has transformative potential and can revolutionize both bioremediation technologies and future biomanufacturing. <br/><br/>This project envisions using multi-domain mixed microbial communities (MMCs), specifically the relatively unexplored fungal-bacterial biofilms, for improved biotransformation and bioremediation of metals and metalloids (M&M) from waste streams and biorecovery of value-added products (e.g., metallic nanoparticles) beneficial to society. This project will address some of the main challenges in using MMCs for bioprocessing: the poor understanding of MMCs and the lack of bioreactors to successfully cultivate MMCs and maintain stable bioprocessing. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop and optimize MMCs and bioreactor systems for improved bioprocessing of M&M for bioremediation and biorecovery. As a proof of concept, selenium (Se, a common metalloid found in acid mine drainage) will be used as an example to assess the potential use of the proposed fungal-bacterial biofilm systems for M&M bioremediation and biorecovery in this project. Three main tasks are proposed: (1) establishing fungal-bacterial biofilms with relevant environmental microorganisms and characterizing their structural and mechanical properties using a combination of cutting-edge techniques including magnetic tweezers, shear rheometry, and optical coherence tomography; (2) developing Membrane Biofilm Reactors (MBfR), an emergent technology based on the use of membranes that transfer gas to a biofilm growing on the membrane, to support fungal-bacterial biofilm establishment; and (3) assessing and optimizing reactor performance and stability of MBfRs with fungal-bacterial biofilms for the removal of Se and its recovery. Understanding and controlling microbial interactions in MMCs and developing improved multi-domain bioreactor systems is key to building a sustainable future minimizing pollution and to utilizing waste streams for the recovery of the generation of high-value products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The characteristics that control their cementitious nature, i.e., the rates of precipitation, structural mechanisms for strengthening, and stability in relevant environments, are not known and this hinders their widespread use. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will reveal new pathways for the chemical synthesis of cementitious MSH and the chemical control of their consequent morphological, mechanical, and chemical properties. Meaningful undergraduate research experiences targeting women and underrepresented minority students at the home and neighboring institutions including a community college will improve STEM and transfer student outcomes, enrich graduate student training, and create a pipeline of students interested in materials science and engineering, cultivating the nation?s future workforce.

Using this database, the team has shown that while individual engineering programs may have poor graduation rates, that a multi-institutional view reveals that engineering programs as a whole graduate a larger fraction of students than other groups of disciplines. The team has also shown that women and men have similar graduation rates in engineering, likely a result of efforts to make engineering education a welcoming environment for women and the high academic credentials of the women who do study engineering. As with the overall graduation rate, individual institutions and programs can and do have worse outcomes. A comprehensive study of student pathways in various engineering disciplines provided practitioners with rich information specific to their disciplinary context. The team has also designed a variety of metrics that have provided researchers and practitioners with an improved understanding of student pathways. The quality of the data source and the research team is attested by these substantial findings, multiple best paper awards, and other recognitions. Following efforts to solicit data from additional institutions and create opportunities for other researchers to use the database, this project will make the data more accessible to a wider range of researchers while making it easier to recruit new institutional partners. Making the data available to a wider range of researchers in different disciplines will use result in a larger range of research results more quickly using different approaches. <br/><br/>This project will transition this useful dataset to ASEE, the American Society for Engineering Education, and allow ASEE to build the technical infrastructure to maintain the data collection after the transition. ASEE has a mechanism for collecting institutional data (though with less detail) and a mechanism for charging for access to the data they collect. ASEE does not compete with alternative data providers because ASEE is not an academic institution, which will make it easier to solicit new data to expand this resource. The project will support ASEE in building a new data schema to collect and store this richer dataset as well as build a range of tools to make it easier for practitioners and researchers to view aspects of the data through dashboards. During the term of the project, ASEE will also transfer all legal agreements with the institutional partners. The current team of researchers using the database will support this effort as a liaison to provide an interface with institutional partners. To support a growing community of researchers in using the database, the research team will also deliver workshops to help educate people about the database and how to use it effectively. The research team will also continue to develop software tools that can be used by other researchers and practitioners to work with the database. Archiving and maintaining the data collection at ASEE ensures that the current dataset will be preserved, that it will grow to include a larger and more diverse set of institutions, and that the dataset will be more accessible, which will ensure that these insights are able to continue and, through ASEE?s national platform, influence multiple national stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The size of an earthquake and the propensity of an earthquake to create large dangerous tsunamis is determined by variations in the plate interface coupling which creates locked and unlocked regions of the fault. Understanding these variations in plate coupling is critical to understanding these dangerous earthquakes. Strain is released along some offshore parts of fault interfaces in occasional slow slip events (SSEs) where the fault moves much as with a normal earthquake, but the stored energy is released so slowly that these events are barely or not detectable on land.  Regions between the SSE regions may remain locked, producing the potential for large tsunamigenic earthquakes. There is some evidence that SSEs on one part of a plate interface may increase strain on adjacent parts, triggering large earthquakes. Seafloor pressure gauges can detect SSEs as the seafloor moves upward during a SSE, decreasing the depth of the gauge. A SSE was detected and mapped in the proposed study region offshore New Zealand in 2015 using pressure gauges, as this is currently the only feasible method appropriate for wide application offshore.  Those observations were greatly limited by the effects of oceanographic noise from ocean eddies. A much larger experiment is now planned for the same region. By adding oceanographic observations of near-seafloor current and vertical echo sounder data, the research should show this noise source can be much reduced and therefore reveal the spatial and temporal extent of offshore SSEs in greater detail and with better accuracy, improving our understanding of plate coupling relevant to understanding great earthquakes. The project will train a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher and involve them in a large international experiment. <br/><br/>During this large collaborative experiment with New Zealand and Japanese scientists, a large array of ocean bottom geodetic, oceanographic, and seismological instruments will be deployed for two years offshore of the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, where one or more shallow SSEs are expected to occur during the deployment.  The joint array would include 44 seafloor absolute pressure gauges (APGs) and 12 current meters and upward looking sonars to test and develop innovative methods to remove contaminating pressure variations that arise within the water column (labeled oceanographic noise). The reduced-noise seafloor data will enable more accurate description of the spatio-temporal evolution of offshore slow-slip events (SSEs). For the first time, an array of 11 APG sensors equipped with a system for removing long term drift from sensor data will be deployed, with potential long term benefit for oceanographic observations and for applying seafloor vertical geodesy at tectonic strain rates. Data from 21 ocean bottom seismometers in the combined array will be used to probe the relationship between earthquakes and tremor and seafloor SSEs. These observations will advance our understanding of offshore variations in plate coupling in subduction zones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significant evidence supports the idea that a loss of insulating snow cover caused by global warming exposes yellow-cedar (YC) roots to frost damage, which eventually leads to tree death. The purpose of this project is to better understand how climate change is affecting yellow-cedar (YC), an iconic tree species in widespread decline. To date, over 3,000 km2 of YC forests have experienced significant dieback, which has had far-reaching economic, ecological, and cultural effects in Southeast Alaska and British Columbia. Yellow-cedar is now considered a ?poster child? of the global trend of declining forest health in response to anthropogenic warming, and successful YC conservation efforts will hinge on identifying all the links between climate change and tree death. Drought stress in the aftermath of frost damage to YC roots during periods of anomalous, late-winter weather is an untested yet potentially critical link in the dieback process. Through a collaboration between the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) and the University of Arizona, this project will test whether declining YC trees exhibit symptoms of drought stress by applying newly developed methods to analyze cedar wood anatomy. In addition to peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations led by an early-career researcher, this project will involve a week-long workshop with K-12 students and forest managers in the Alaska Native community of Kake. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to test an important corollary of the ?frost-damaged root? hypothesis; namely, that YC root injury results in drought stress and eventual tree mortality. To avoid cavitation, drought-stressed conifer trees lay down thinner-diameter and thicker-walled tracheid cells within their annual rings, and these anatomical changes can be documented using new methods in quantitative wood anatomy (QWA). This project will use these methods to test the prediction that tracheid cells in the outer rings of declining and dead YC trees have significantly lower lumen areas and thicker walls relative to the same annual rings grown in nearby healthy YC trees. To accomplish this, the investigator from UAF will work with a collaborator at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona to apply QWA methods on long dead, actively declining, and currently healthy YC trees collected from Southeast Alaska. These results will provide new insight about climate change and forest dieback and will allow stakeholders to predict the impacts of frost damage and drought more accurately on this important tree species. In addition, this project will expand research infrastructure at UAF by acquiring new analytical methods that will benefit an array of environmental research in Alaska.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the risks associated with wildfires do not stop once the fire has been extinguished. The ravaged slopes are still at risk for potentially catastrophic mudslides. As frequency and severity of wildfires increases, so does the frequency and severity of mudslides. Unfortunately, researchers still do not fully understand how burned soils and ash behave after a wildfire. How strong is wildfire ash? Does a burned slope become stronger or weaker once ash is deposited after a fire? Once a wildfire is extinguished, where does the ash go and how does it age? This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award strives to answer these questions by examining the engineering behaviors of slopes exposed to wildfires. Specific objectives include characterizing wildfires ashes and burned soils and measuring their strength, compressibility, and hydraulic properties. This research will assist those who assess the risks associated with post-fire mudslides. It is important that we understand the geotechnical engineering behavior of ash and burned soil, so that we can provide the most accurate and most effective tools to protect communities from post-wildfire hazards. This research will also be providing educational benefits to historically underrepresented groups in engineering, as the research will support the hiring of undergraduate and graduate student researchers from underrepresented communities.  <br/><br/>This research program focuses on examining wildfire-exposed areas from a geotechnical perspective, to determine if the addition of ash and dry ravel to soil slopes and basins weakens these areas and could potentially cause slope failures. Although there is a significant quantity of research in the literature concerning the factors that trigger debris flows, limited data is available on shear strength characteristics of wildfire ash and ash/soil mixtures. This is a large gap is our understanding of debris flow behaviors, as the soft, unconsolidated ash layer plays a crucial role in the stability of the post-wildfire slope. To supplement the available research in this area, this work will determine the strength and hydraulic characteristics of wildfire ash and ash/soil mixtures from central and southern California. Specific objectives include measuring the shear strength of wildfire ash and ash/soil mixtures using a combination of shear strength devices, measuring the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic properties of wildfire ash/soil mixtures, performing standard geotechnical index property testing of wildfire ash and burned soils, and performing geochemical testing on wildfire ashes. This work should provide a deeper understanding of the engineering properties of residual materials post-wildfire.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

FAPROTAX has been used in >700 studies (as of November 2021) in a broad spectrum of environments. With this award, FAPROTAX will be revised to resolve many of its current limitations and substantially expand its applicability scope. FAPROTAX2 will be the only tool for conducting broad phenotypic predictions in microbiome surveys based on both experimental and genomic evidence, thus providing a valuable and unique resource for microbiome research. FAPROTAX2 will allow rapid insight into the metabolic functional potential of microbial communities without the need for expensive metagenomic sequencing or culturing. Hence, FAPROTAX2 will help tackle a multitude of environmental, industrial, agricultural and human health issues related to the microbiota, such as the bioremediation of soil pollutants, habitat restoration and conservation, wastewater treatment, landfill management, biofuel production, agricultural soil enhancement, and treating human diseases. As a side-product, the proposed project will also deliver an unprecedentedly comprehensive database of metabolic phenotypes across thousands of prokaryotic species, thus facilitating investigations of microbial evolution and providing valuable training/testing data for algorithms that predict prokaryotic phenotypes from genomes. This project will also provide student training in bioinformatics, programming, database design and management, and microbiology. <br/><br/>FAPROTAX predicts  the metabolic functions encoded by bacterial and archaeal (?prokaryotic?) 16S rRNA phylotypes in marker-gene microbiome surveys, based on published experimental evidence (e.g., from cultures) across thousands of taxa, covering >80 metabolic functions of environmental, industrial and medical interest. The specific improvements to be completed under this funding include incorporation of additional experimental evidence from more literature sources, redefinition of metabolic functions to be consistent with MetaCyc (a major metabolic pathway database), inclusion of phenotypic information from thousands of available prokaryotic genomes, added support for calculating prediction uncertainties, and increased flexibility when balancing sensitivity versus specificity, depending on the user's objectives. The proposed revision, FAPROTAX2, will be the only tool for conducting broad phenotypic predictions in marker-gene microbiome surveys based on both experimental and genomic evidence. These improvements will improve the ability to study the metabolic functions of microbial communities and their role in ecosystem processes.

This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award focuses on improving the quality of life of women with epilepsy by creating forecasting algorithms that can help manage dosing of antiseizure medication based on predicted seizure risk.

Epistemologies of science elucidate why and how science works. Understanding the nature of science enables philosophers and scientists to work together to improve scientific methods and further scientific progress, as well as to employ science to improve the welfare of the nation and the world. This EPSCoR Research Fellowship will produce the first analysis of the epistemology of agricultural science. Agricultural science is an interdisciplinary and applied set of scientific practices that will feature prominently in solutions to urgent, global 21st-century problems, including the energy crisis and food shortages anticipated by climate change. Understanding the epistemology of agricultural science will improve the abilities of scientists and policymakers to employ the results of agricultural science to solve large-scale social problems.  The PI and a postdoctoral scholar will collect field data, receive additional training members in science and values, and strengthen an existing research collaboration at Michigan State University, to advance the PI?s research on the epistemology of agricultural science.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>This EPSCoR Research Fellowship will fund a research residency for the PI and a postdoctoral scholar to collect field data, receive additional training, and strengthen an existing research collaboration at Michigan State University (MSU), in order to advance the PI?s research on the epistemology of agricultural science. The Fellowship is co-sponsored by the MSU Department of Philosophy, the MSU Socially Engaged Philosophy of Science (SEPOS) group, and the MSU Center for Interdisciplinarity. The overall objective of the Fellowship is to accelerate research in the epistemology of agricultural science by strengthening the research partnership between philosophers at the University of Kentucky and MSU. This will be accomplished via two types of research activity: 1) Collaborative philosophical research with members of the sponsoring institutes.  The PI and postdoc will additionally receive training from SEPOS members in science and values, a branch of philosophy of science for which MSU and SEPOS are widely renowned; and 2) Collection of data from philosophical fieldwork on the agricultural scientific activity being conducted at MSU. The PI employs fieldwork methods to conduct research, including interviewing and shadowing practicing agricultural scientists to examine how they generate concepts and theoretical frameworks. Due to the localized nature of agricultural science, comparative data across multiple locations, e.g. Kentucky and Michigan, is required. Analysis of applied science, especially agricultural science, innovates on the way epistemology of science understands the nature of the scientific practice. This advances inquiry in the epistemology of science, particularly impacting existing research in the philosophy of scientific classification and the study of science and values. This Fellowship will expand the scope of philosophy of science, and, via the collection of field data, it will also generate a dataset that will catalyze additional new scholarship in the epistemology of science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will identify safe, naturally produced molecules that provide enhanced fungicidal activity. The system will be developed to address Botrytis cinerea, which causes devastating diseases on 500+ plant species, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables, and results in economic losses ranging from $10 billion to $100 billion worldwide; the project will then address Phakopsora pachyrhizi, the cause of Asian soybean rust (SBR). <br/><br/>The proposed project addresses the fundamental difficulty that, while agricultural adjuvants can improve the efficiency of agrochemicals against plant pathogens increasing crop yields and productivities, achieving this goal is dependent on fungicide-adjuvant relative doses, crop type, and physical characteristics of spray formulations. The latter is critical to facilitate the sticking of active-adjuvant formulations onto leaves. This project develops capabilities in sophorolipid (SL) modification chemistries to generate a library of compounds. Then, a high-throughput screening assay will allow rapid assessment of adjuvant-fungicide beneficial synergies. In parallel, to assess the potential for topical and systemic toxicities, selected adjuvant-fungicide combinations will be evaluated on fibroblast and kidney cell lines. SL analogs will also be tested for growth inhibition of a representative panel of non-pathogenic rhizobacteria. Also, in planta phytotoxicity will be studied using the detached leaf assay method. Fundamental interfacial and physical characterizations of the spraying formulation will determine the extent that active-adjuvant formulations stick onto leaves.

Thus, educators need tools for developing empathy in engineers. Yet, measuring empathy is challenging because it manifests uniquely in different contexts. To begin addressing the need for an engineering-specific measure of empathy, we developed and pilot-tested an assessment instrument. Our prior work suggested a need to improve how empathy is measured across all aspects of the design phases and to account for variation in empathy for distinct user groups. Thus, in this study, our primary objective is to refine this instrument and to ensure its validity, reliability, and fairness for assessing empathic formation in undergraduate engineering design across multiple contexts, design phases, and participants. We will integrate and account for these perspectives in the expansion of the instrument, thus ensuring that the instrument captures a diverse group of instructor perspectives and needs. Thus, this study will support a critical need for a valid tool for assessing empathy in engineering design.<br/><br/>Empathy can provide the ?spark of human concern for others,? thus bolstering efforts at integrating empathy into engineering curriculum and help students? empathic growth with and for users. Thus, a measure of empathy can help students care, understand, and help users in need. In this study, we will iterate on an instrument for assessing empathy with a diverse group of engineering design instructors to identify potential refinements of the instrument needed to improve its alignment with their contexts, collect student data to ensure potential instrument refinements that accurately represent student experiences, and design a revised instrument that accounts for these novel insights. We will test the revised instrument for validity via the triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data with a large sample of students. Finally, we will use the instrument to identify differences in empathic formation associated with various instructional design contexts and practices, thus generating new knowledge on best practices for promoting empathic formation in engineering design. Our team brings prior research in empathic design, distinct engineering backgrounds, and expertise in multiple research methodologies which will ensure research rigor and quality. Our collaborators are design educators and thus will help ensure the instrument is useful for engineering design courses across disciplines and across university sites. The advisory board includes experts in empathy, design, and psychometrics who will provide external evaluation and guidance to ensure that the instrument represents the state of the art of research on empathy in engineering design. By providing the community with this measure, we can facilitate the integration of empathy and assessment of empathy in engineering classroom contexts, which can positively impact the experience and retention of pro-socially motivated students in engineering programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen, that are contained in aquatic insects are an important food subsidy to terrestrial ecosystems.  However, insects are sensitive to and declining globally because of altered water availability, pollution, and temperature warming. Despite these widespread declines, little is known about how emergence may affect neighboring terrestrial ecosystems because the critical adult aquatic insect life-stage that allows energy and nutrients to be transferred from the aquatic environment to terrestrial consumers is sorely understudied in monitoring programs. This project investigates the role of a severe drying disturbance in regulating emerging aquatic insect hatches, in particular that of the salmonfly, which is a species of large aquatic insect in the stonefly order that is sensitive to global change. The researchers are evaluating how drastically reduced water flow from a dam gate failure influences salmonfly density, biomass, and emergence timing. A postdoctoral scholar and several undergraduate research assistants are being trained, a public survey on the topic of drought will be completed, and the research will be presented at a local festival in southwestern Montana. Public outreach will highlight the tight connections between water and land and the importance of emerging aquatic insects as a source of nutrients and energy to fish, birds, and mammals.<br/><br/>This project will make transformative contributions to our understanding of the shifting role and resiliency of aquatic-terrestrial linkages under anthropogenic change by contributing novel information about the influence of a pulse drying disturbance on the adult life-stage of aquatic insects. The research project investigates how a dam malfunction on the Madison River in southwestern Montana that resulted in a short but extensive drying event could change aquatic insect emergence compared to prior years.  The focal organism for the research is the giant salmonfly, which is an ecologically and culturally important aquatic insect in rivers in the Rocky Mountain West. The project will quantify salmonfly density and timing during emergence using field observations, laboratory flume experiments that manipulate drought conditions to assess salmonfly survival and movement, and simulations of different drying extents to quantify the influence of drought on export of nutrients from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. This project is one of the first to evaluate how global change alters nutrient cycles by changing aquatic insect hatches and severing ties between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is based on a full-scale natural experiment conducted in Alexandria, Virginia, where the local transit agency DASH (Driving Alexandria Safely Home) has decided to implement a fare-free public transportation program over its service territory, motivated primarily by fairness and equity considerations. Such a natural experiment will be based on a data collection the study area and from one or more control locations?while the program is in place, and retrospectively for a suitable period before its implementation?for a proper assessment of its accomplishments and effects. The survey plan will involve both users of the DASH system as well as members of the general public at the treatment location to understand actual or potential travel, general travel patterns, and whether the fare free has displaced private car travel and emissions, or other transportation modes. The data collection plan will be complemented with parallel surveys of transit users and members of the general public at the control locations to elicit similar information and their intended use of transit if the bus became free. This research and its results may influence policy recommendations and infrastructure investment decisions that will impact the future of our transportation system and the quality of life of citizens in America. The impacts from this project are especially relevant at this time, when transit use is slowly recovering from the pandemic and has not yet reached pre-pandemic ridership and travel mode shares, and when large-scale funding to infrastructure is being considered by this Administration and the Congress.<br/><br/>From a methodological perspective, the study involves challenging statistical procedures in terms of sampling, analyzing, and modeling the data from both probabilistic and non-probabilistic samples. Challenges include the construction of sampling weights, the selection of control location, matching treated and control subjects to ensure valid statistical inference, and many others. A multi-disciplinary team composed by faculties and students in engineering, economics, survey methodology and mathematics will work collaboratively on survey design, data linkage, econometric model estimation, and travel behavior and policy analysis. The project is expected to be serving as a proof of concept for similar programs elsewhere and will be a reference for the many transit agencies implementing innovative policy schemes to increase ridership and accessibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To maximize involvement of students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields (students who represent nearly half of the student body of UC Riverside), the project includes a program that will give 20 undergraduates the opportunity to assist with building beta versions of the proposed instrument for testing by bioscience collaborators. This valuable career-readiness training will contribute to the development of a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce. Additionally, by developing an open-source bioinstrument design suitable for replication by other researchers and future commercial production, the project will enhance the nation?s research infrastructure and lay the foundations for future partnerships between academia and industry.<br/><br/>Measurements of the mass of an object are ubiquitous throughout the sciences. But in the biosciences, many of the objects studied?like cells, microorganisms, fish embryos, insect larvae, sprouting seeds, hydrogels, oral pharmaceuticals, and many more?reside in a liquid environment. This makes it difficult or impossible to accurately measure the mass of these biosamples using conventional tools like laboratory balances. In addition, the masses of many biosamples change in meaningful ways?an organism gains mass as it grows, a biodegradable material loses mass as it dissolves away, and so on?and accurately monitoring these mass changes over time is very labor-intensive. To address these gaps in biologists? ability to capture observations of biological phenomena, this project will develop and disseminate a free and open-source design for an instrument capable of automatically monitoring the mass, volume, and density of any microgram-sized biosample, in any desired liquid, with nanogram-scale resolution.  The instrument utilizes a vibrating tube sensor, a simple piece of glass tubing vibrated at its resonance frequency. By passing a millimeter-sized biosample in fluid through this sensor, the mass of the sample is recorded as a change in the sensor?s resonance frequency. The instrument development process will be guided by feedback from a diverse set of five beta-testing bioscience research labs at UC Riverside who will use the instrument in toxicology, biomaterials, drug delivery, entomology, and plant science research. The result will be a low-cost and easy-to-use instrument design that any bioscience researcher can replicate and use to monitor any suitably sized biosample, in any liquid, in a fully automated manner, over any desired timescale.  This will give a diverse community of bioscience researchers a tool that not only supports and accelerates their existing research but also opens up whole new techniques and areas of inquiry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fermented foods exemplify the importance of microbial communities because microbes drive the fermentation that results in the flavors, textures, extended shelf-life and even some health benefits of these foods. Many of these foods have multi-faceted significance, including nutritional and cultural importance as well as roles in food security due to extended shelf life. Working with locally important fermented foods, such as taro (poi), this project will determine how the success and abundance of microbial species is determined not only by the abiotic environment (e.g., temperature, moisture, acidity, nutrients) but also by biotic interactions (e.g., helpful or harmful influences of other organisms). This project will increase research capacity, advance scientific knowledge with basic and applied importance, and initiate a research program that will provide culturally relevant scientific training opportunities. The fellowship will take place at the University of California, in the laboratory of a world leader in fermented food microbiology. Through this fellowship and collaboration, the PI and student will develop expertise in cutting edge molecular methods to identify the traits that determine bacterial fitness. Integration of these tools with the PI?s complementary expertise in microbial community ecology will substantially increase the PI?s research capacity and the reach of her research program while strengthening the microbiome science program at the University of Hawai?i. <br/><br/>This project aims to determine the fitness consequences of microbial interactions under changing environmental conditions. The project will specifically focus on microbial interactions during ecological succession in locally important fermented foods, but the scope of the research question is broadly important across basic and applied microbial ecology. The project will employ recently developed high throughput molecular methods to identify genes or putative traits needed for bacterial survival. These mechanistic methods will be integrated with a community ecological framework to understand the fitness consequences of microbial interactions (i.e., how microbes affect each other?s fitness), what molecular mechanisms underly those effects, and how the interactions change due to shifting environmental conditions. The research will advance scientific understanding of why certain microbial species are successful or abundant in a given environment. The new knowledge generated can benefit society by informing future efforts to predict the beneficial value of microbial communities and eventually engineer microbial communities for desired functions. This project will develop a basic research model focused on local, culturally important fermented foods, which have historically been understudied. By creating culturally relevant research training opportunities, this project will foster broader participation in science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AR/VR technologies connect people with the digital world through immersive experiences, and present unbounded applications in many industries. However, these technologies face many obstacles, such as limitations in optical clarity and resolution. The display industry is in urgent need of new innovation that can achieve much higher resolutions than what existing technologies deliver. To this end, the industry is actively investing in micro-LED technology, where the pixel size nears an order of magnitude reduction from the current state of the art. Better resolution is desirable across the entire display industry, ranging from smartphones/watches to large panel displays, but micro-LEDs will benefit consumers most by transforming AR/VR. However, the manufacturing process of micro-LED displays is extremely time consuming and labor intensive, which leads to prohibitive costs, yields, and production times. The proposed technology is expected to profoundly reduce the cost of next generation displays for AR/VR and transition micro-LED displays from research to market.<br/><br/>The proposed project advances a technology that will propel micro-LEDs through the manufacturing obstacles into mainstream displays. The technology combines a micro-patterning method and innovative light-emitting material, compatible with existing semiconductor manufacturing, and promises to significantly reduce the number of key steps in micro-LED manufacturing. Conventional micro-LED array fabrication requires processing each color of LED, blue, green, and red, on individual semiconductor wafers. These LEDs must then be separated and assembled on a display substrate through the manual and error-prone pick-and-place process. The proposed micro-color converter requires the creation of only a single blue micro-LED array, with no need to manage individual pieces. Color converters absorb light of higher energy and emit lower-energy light, and through patterning, select blue pixels can become green or red. The color converter utilizes metal-halide perovskite semiconductors, a cost-effective, solution-processible light-emitting material with outstanding optical properties. Like other organic materials, one significant challenge with perovskites is their incompatibility with standard photolithographic micro-patterning processes. The proposed technology bridges this gap by enabling micro-patterning of perovskites with many of the same photolithography tools already in production, while protecting the layers during fabrication thus maintaining the material?s high optical quality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The former addresses the failure of the market to provide complete information on the costs and benefits of purchasing energy-efficient products, while the latter addresses the fact that consumers do not capture the full social value of environmental goods and services. Using insights from economics and psychology, this research seeks to understand why programs using information provision and financial incentives as tools have been unable to close the ?energy efficiency gap,? the gap between actual and desired adoption of energy-efficient technology, among households in the United States. This research develops interventions that provide information on the cost-savings and emissions benefits of purchasing an energy-efficient product, discounts on that same product, or both, and dissects the behavioral effects of those interventions. As a result, this work has the following broader impacts: improved societal welfare through energy use reduction, which saves consumers money and mitigates anthropogenic climate change; and promotion of the progress of science through an enhanced grasp on the drivers of, and obstacles to scientific literacy.<br/><br/>This research investigates two explanations for the energy efficiency gap: 1) the possibility of policy interactions when multiple policy instruments are simultaneously used; and 2) the possibility that policy choice not only impacts the final choices people make but also the process through which people make choices. These explanations lead to a theoretically motivated research design that consists of an online survey-experiment in which respondents are randomized into different treatments that vary the information and incentives representing different policy mixes. Respondents? demand for an energy-efficient product is elicited, and other data on their decision-making and predictors of their decision-making are collected, including data on their demographic, behavioral, cognitive, and attitudinal characteristics. Survey responses are linked to actual purchase decisions to incentivize the realism of respondents? choices. Results give insights into interventions leading to increase in demand for an energy-efficient product. Interventions include interactions between information and incentives, such as whether information on the emissions impact of purchasing energy-efficient products can effectively supplement cost information, and whether prompting respondents to deliberate over their preferences can increase demand for energy efficiency. By exploring different policy options and potential behavioral mechanisms behind policy responses, this project informs policy design. It also advances guidance on policy implementation and contributes to a deeper understanding of consumer decision-making as affected by policies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decadal surveys are notable in their ability to sample thoroughly the research interest, aspirations, and needs of a scientific community. Through a rigorous process, a primary survey committee and thematic panels of community members construct a prioritized program of science goals and objectives and define a strategy that can achieve these objectives given anticipated budgetary and technical resources. As with past decadal surveys, the next solar and space physics decadal survey is designed to draw widespread community participation, engage the community in consensus-building, and set specific discipline-specific science targets and priorities for the coming decade. The study will provide scientific direction for the field of solar and space physics; organize the scientific community and the relevant agencies, particularly NASA, NSF, and NOAA; inform other decision-makers in the legislative and executive branches (particularly OMB and OSTP); document the needs for a scientifically- and technically-trained workforce in solar and space physics; and communicate the societal benefits of solar and space physics (e.g., interdisciplinary connections, education, workforce training, public outreach). The survey report will also contribute to the general public?s greater understanding of recent accomplishments and future goals in solar and space physics. The new decadal survey will update and extend the 2013 decadal survey that resulted in the report, Solar and Space Physics, A Science for a Technological Society. <br/><br/>This project funds the Space Studies Board (SSB) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to establish a decadal survey committee to develop a comprehensive science and mission strategy for solar and space physics (heliophysics) research for a ten-year period beginning in approximately 2024.

Specifically targeted biological applications will be on cell sorting based on cell?s size or mechanical stiffness, microinjection of genes into living cells, and selective collection of cell-containing droplets in a microfluidic channel. As the transducers are based on bulk acoustic waves, the technology offers tweezing live cells without force limitation, heat, or requirement of transparent media. Moreover, since the transducer focuses acoustic energy only on a very small spot and is capable of delivering acoustic energy through an intermediate solid, it can be applied to various microfluidic platforms for management of cells, liquids, particles and proteins. The transducer?s electrical controllability on the location/direction of the trapping force, combined with amenability of the transducers being formed into an array, allows the creation of complex biochemical assays and/or biomedical treatments at high throughput. Thus, the transducer?s unprecedented capability of capture and on-demand manipulation of living cells and/or particles (tens - hundreds of microns in diameter) in three dimensional (3D) space will open up many new possibilities in cell study, gene transfection, juxtaposition and manipulation. Sets of the transducers and power amplifiers will be delivered to four selected biological labs during the years 2 and 3 of the research period so that the labs may use them for sorting, gene delivery or any other biological experiments in their labs. The results of the research will be incorporated into the second edition of the principal investigator?s textbook on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), entitled ?Fundamentals of MEMS,? as well as in the MEMS curriculum at USC. Outreach activities will include research experience for undergraduate and high school students who will be excited with the experiments involving cells and microparticles. Also, students from underrepresented groups will be actively recruited for the proposed research.<br/><br/>The transducers will be based on Multi-foci Fresnel Transducer (MFT) capable of capturing and moving microparticles in 3D space on demand. Specifically targeted biological applications of the capture and move will include gene microinjection (through sonoporation) and lipid-mediated gene delivery. Also developed will be MFT-based cell sorting in microfluidic channels as well as formation and collection of cell-containing droplets in a microfluidic channel. An advanced version of MFT having two overlapping circular electrodes has been shown to make the ultrasonic waves arrive at a narrow region along the vertical axis with constructive wave interference to create a narrow Bessel-beam-like focal zone with long depth-of-focus. This process also produces bottle beams and quasi-Airy beams where radiation force toward the inner region exists and thus, multiple particles can be trapped. This advanced version along with various other versions of MFT will be developed, optimized and tested for the specific biological instrumentations. Electrical controllability of the tweezing location in 3D space will be developed so that the captured cells may be: (1) moved from one location to another, (2) stretched or compressed, (3) brought into contact with other cells or gene-containing liposomes, all upon electrical command signal without having to move the transducers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zeolites frequently catalyze chemical reactions in water, as is the case when producing renewable fuels and chemicals from biomass. The interactions of water molecules with the zeolite catalysts are incredibly complex, but it is important to understand how these systems behave so that zeolites can be optimized for application-based performance.

Transportation and disposal of this excess sludge comprise half of the total wastewater treatment cost, exceeding $2 billion per year with a steady 1% annual increase. A common practice to stabilize waste sludge is anaerobic digestion (AD) prior to disposal. This technology can be described as the microbial transformation of sludge into biogas in the absence of free oxygen. The biogas produced from AD is a valuable green fuel, and it has comparable calorific value to natural gas.  Furthermore, the digested sludge becomes easier to transport and dispose of after AD. Despite these environmental and economic advantages, AD has long reaction times, and low process yields. Even under 20-30 days of retention, sludge decomposition is incomplete, leaving 35-45% of the sludge undigested. This project utilizes extremely reactive, recoverable magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (or superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles) to improve the efficiency of sludge digestion and improve the economic and environmental benefits of the process. This RII Track-4:NSF project aims to minimize the costs and environmental impacts associated with excess sewage sludge management.  This fellowship will take place at Yale University within the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering and involves support for a graduate trainee.<br/><br/>Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are ground-breaking nanomaterials with remarkable application potential in a multitude of industries. SPIONs can respond to magnetic domains rapidly and efficiently without significant remanence. In addition, they can heat rapidly under microwave (MW) irradiation. Their properties make them promising candidates for sludge pretreatment applications. First, they have the potential to bind to components of sludge floc assemblies and deliver immediate and intense MW heating strategically to cells or extracellular polymers. MW irradiation creates an oscillating electromagnetic field that causes SPIONs to have both their electrical dipole moments and their magnetic moments rotate, creating internal vibrations that dissipate energy in the form of heat locally. Second, due to their size (typically <50 nm) SPIONs have spin electrons packed within a minuscule physical domain that can respond to the magnetic field without remanence magnetism (i.e., showing properties of both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials). Therefore, SPIONs do not have the burden of magnetic hysteresis, which empowers their effective and rapid recovery from slurries even in complicated reactor installations. The key merit of this proposed study is that SPION properties can be strategically tuned for superior dielectric heating and magnetic reactivity while maintaining material integrity to accomplish repeated use for MW pretreatment.  Through this RII Track-4:NSF fellowship, the PI aims to develop a practical technology that will tailor and employ SPIONS as dielectric and recoverable susceptors for MW-induced pre-hydrolysis of wastewater sludges. First, the PI and a graduate trainee will learn protocols for advanced SPION synthesis. Next, the team will focus on at least three SPIONs that show promise in terms of paramagnetic abilities, MW heating, and material integrity for repeated use. Finally, the process for wastewater treatment will be optimized, and experiments to identify hydrolysis pathways such as the role of temperature, water chemistry, slurry viscosity and formation of hydroxyl radicals and other basic controls will be conducted to ensure data quality.  This fellowship will take place at Yale University within the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thermoelectric devices can be used to improve energy efficiency by recovering waste heat from thermal processes. Thermoelectric coolers can achieve solid-state cooling that eliminates the usage of refrigerants. Current manufacturing practices for thermoelectrics rely on conventional technologies such as machining and soldering, which are not only costly but also limit device designs. This work will investigate thermoelectric materials with transverse electrical and thermal properties, so heat transfer occurs in a direction perpendicular to the electric field in the material. This transverse property can enable design and manufacturing of new thermoelectric devices. Transverse thermoelectric technologies can provide new solutions to improve energy efficiency, utilization of unconventional thermal energy, and solid-state cooling and refrigeration. This work will also advance knowledge of additive manufacturing of novel thermoelectric materials. The outcome of this work will help promote additive manufacturing technologies in the United States.<br/><br/>Transverse thermoelectric materials are capable of decoupling electrical and thermal transport, which in turn enables design of unique thermoelectric devices such as those with large aspect ratios and complex shapes. Although theory has predicted that significant transverse thermoelectricity can be achieved in composite materials with engineered anisotropy, fabrication of such structures is difficult using conventional manufacturing methods. This work will use additive manufacturing to construct composite thermoelectric materials. The research team will examine the microstructures of additively manufactured samples, including textures and porosities, and correlate these microstructural features to the material properties. Mathematical modeling will be used to understand the effect of material anisotropy and defects on the transverse thermoelectricity. It is expected that this research effort will lead to establishment of a quantitative relationship between the manufacturing parameters, the microstructure, and the properties of composite transverse thermoelectric materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today?s computer networks have grown both in complexity and in scale, in part as a response to diverse connectivity requirements in the era of the Internet of Things, Cloud 3.0, and Big Data. Existing network management solutions cannot keep up with the demand for solutions to real-time network management problems resulting from these increasingly complex networks. Network management requires a fundamentally new approach in which networks can autonomously control, configure, and manage themselves. While these ?self-driving networks? offer numerous opportunities for efficient network management, they introduce new threats and attack vectors that must be addressed to secure them. Unfortunately, there is currently a shortfall of professionals trained in autonomous and intelligent network security and a shortfall of content with which to train these professionals. This project will address these shortfalls by developing lab-intensive modules that enable undergraduate students to gain fundamental and advanced knowledge in securing next-generation self-driving networks. <br/><br/>The project team will develop six self-contained modules with comprehensive coverage of the techniques, tools, and methods required to secure self-driving networks. The modules will cover (1) attack investigation and analysis of legacy, Software Defined Networking (SDN), and adversarial attacks; (2) hunting for vulnerabilities using static analysis, software component analysis, automated known attack patterns, and behavioral analysis; (3) network-wide data collection using classic and OpenFlow based approaches; (4) protection using runtime application self-protection, automated patching, and security information and event management; (5) evaluation using continuous adaptive risk and thrust assessment; and (6) action using security orchestration, automation and response. In addition, this project aims to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM by organizing workshops and participating in professional conferences. The project team will also organize a workshop to disseminate the modules to interested faculty members from other organizations.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

The future of work can bring opportunities for rural and urban marginalized communities through online work and the gig economy. However, work on current platforms is often low-level labeling work offering few opportunities for advancement. It is often intended to train Artificial Intelligence to automate this work away, instead of training workers. The proposed project aims to uplift workers and improve the marketplace for online work so that digital work may help with the economic recovery of regions whose traditional industries have left. This project aims to develop sustainable methods for transitioning workers to high-skilled and creative digital jobs that are unlikely to be automated in the near to medium term future. Crowd work can be transformed to not only improve the work product for the employer, but also to help the worker move along the career paths necessary for the future of work. The project team from four universities, Carnegie Mellon U., West Virginia U., Pennsylvania State University and University of Pennsylvania has partnered with local institutions to provide workers training to perform progressively more advanced digital work, while earning money. The vision of the project is to scaffold workers through basic computer fluency, working with AI tools, and finally innovation and creativity skills. This work is in collaboration with a rural partner (Rupert Public Library, in Rupert, WV) and urban partner (CommunityForge in Wilkinsburg, PA) and also benefits from a partnership with Bosch Inc. in Pittsburgh, ConservationX Labs in Washington DC, and the State of West Virginia.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses a fundamental challenge in that those who most need to develop skills to gain higher paying jobs cannot afford the unpaid time spent in training needed to develop them. Accomplishing this vision will require solving the following core research questions: (i) How can one best support the marginalized workers in their transition to online work?, (ii) How can Artificial Intelliegnce tools augment workers, rather than displace them?, (iii) How can tools be designed to help workers build skills and creativity for work that is unlikely to be automated in the future?.  This project has the potential to make advances across a variety of interrelated fields including crowdsourcing, Artificial Intelligence, Human Computer Interaction, Cognitive Science, Learning Science, Sociology and Economics. Simultaneously enabling both improved work outcomes as well as skill development in crowd work will require the development of models of workers, skills, and their trajectories at a more nuanced level. Enabling workers to collaborate with Artificial Intelligence will require new human-computer interaction paradigms. Supporting creativity and the development of new skills will require the exploration of new organization and coordination structures. By grounding the investigations in real world contexts, the research aims for generalizable knowledge that can lay a foundation for research on the future of crowd work at the human-AI frontier<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Continued expansion of the internet backbone and improvements in computing hardware have facilitated improvements in video streaming, enabling videos to be more easily downloaded and shared. This, in turn, raises a number of questions of pressing national concern. For example, what makes for an effective course or training program? Which aspects of teaching might be optimized or automated? How and why do learning needs and goals vary across people? How might we lower barriers to achieving a high quality education? The focus of this project is to understand how to provide learners with automatized instruction that is customized to the needs of each individual. It could have a significant impact on the online learning of STEM concepts and how it can be individualized for members of different communities.  Moreover, the investigator?s own teaching and mentoring will bring machine learning, cognitive neuroscience, and instructional design together in a way that will provide development opportunities for the next generation of scientists working on frameworks for characterizing and evaluating real-world teaching and learning.  He will create summer workshops, a regular tutorial series, and a series of open online courses. <br/><br/>The project aims to (1) to build a computational framework for tracking individual students? conceptual learning and understanding; and (2) to test whether and how brain recordings can be used to estimate ongoing conceptual learning and understanding. The project will collect data of what students learn from real online instructional videos to inform, fit, and test models of real-world conceptual learning in such STEM domains as Astronomy and Computer Science programming. Conceptual knowledge is tested by asking participants to solve applied problems that require them to generalize beyond the specific examples presented during training. Applying text embedding-based models run on these data, the investigators will derive semantic maps both of the concepts taught and of what the students learn. The project will also involve collecting a large dataset from participants who engage with a sequence of course videos while undergoing neuroimaging. The experimental data will be used to construct dynamic estimates of each participant?s moment-by-moment conceptual knowledge and their ability to acquire new knowledge. The project will use natural language processing models to quantify concepts and how they relate.

This project aims to rescue the orphaned Fish Collection of the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez (UPR-M), improve access to specimens and associated information, and expand the shelving capacity of the Ichthyology Collection at the Sam Noble Museum (SNOMNH). Integration and accessibility of the two fish collections have the potential to be used across multiple scientific disciplines, including ecology, conservation biology, taxonomy, phylogenetics, fisheries management, anatomy, and physiology. The proposed activities for this proposal are organized around three primary goals?rescue, integration, and long-term preservation?each associated with specific timelines to achieve the overarching proposal goals. The team combines expertise of graduate and undergraduate students, and volunteers with museum experience at different levels in Oklahoma and Puerto Rico to provide a rich context for workshops, and for the development of an integrative training program for the next generation of scientists.<br/>	Natural history collections play a fundamental role as repositories of biodiversity and provide verifiable and permanent records of wildlife and past environmental conditions. This project will rescue and safeguard the UPR-M Ichthyology Collection, one the largest biorepositories of marine fish biodiversity in the Caribbean, encompassing historical data from 13,000 specimens, comprising 805 species, 392 genera, and 123 families in imminent danger to become lost. Integration of the UPR-M Ichthyology collection into the SNOMNH will greatly increase its accessibility to scientists and other users through improved physical access, specimen loans, digitization of the collection, and sharing of data via the museum website, and other network portals. This project will enhance the infrastructure of the SNOMNH Ichthyology Collection and increase its scientific value and accessibility for scientists, educators, and the general public. The SNOMNH Ichthyology Collection is an important scientific resource and biological legacy for the lower Great Plains representing about 20% of the total fish diversity of the United States. It hosts diverse assemblages of mostly freshwater fishes (although its scope has recently expanded to include marine fish species as well), and endemic regional fish fauna from streams and reservoirs in Oklahoma.

The research will also have an impact on real-world applications in large-scale data centers, manufacturing, telecommunications, healthcare, inventory, and service systems, providing skills and tools to manage them effectively. Such systems can often be modeled as a stochastic network, with multiple jobs and many servers, and complex network topology. The operations and management of these sophisticated networked systems are subject to many risk factors under various random environments. This research will develop advanced methods and algorithms to provide solutions that mitigate the potential operational risks in a large-scale network model system. The model system roughly describes the system dynamics in large-scale parallel server networks. The research will provide approximate optimal scheduling and other operational policies. Risk-sensitive control has the advantage of achieving good performance in the presence of disturbances and uncertainty. It also limits large fluctuations since it penalizes higher moments of the running cost. The investigators will incorporate their findings into the existing graduate courses in stochastic networks and control, and disseminate them through seminars on relevant research topics. The research involves a team of interdisciplinary researchers, including those from underrepresented minority groups, and provides training opportunities for graduate students with new mathematical skills. <br/><br/>The objectives of the research are: (1) To develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of eigenvalues of elliptic systems and integro-differential operators to address the associated problems in infinite-horizon risk sensitive control (IHRS) of regime-switching and jump diffusions. (2) To develop the techniques required to establish asymptotic optimality and study the associated stochastic differential games and large deviation characterizations. (3) To study the large-time asymptotic behavior and relative value iteration algorithms, which form the basis of rolling horizon control and reinforcement learning methods. This research will greatly advance the theory of eigenvalues of integro-differential operators and elliptic systems and produce ground-breaking methodologies for risk-sensitive control of diffusions (with jumps) and regime-switching diffusions. On the analytical side, this research will greatly contribute to the current efforts in the literature concerning nonlinear eigenvalue problems in unbounded domains. A wealth of results on variational characterizations, maximum and large deviation principles, and the associated Feynman-Kac semigroup for nonsymmetric operators are expected to be obtained.  Another important contribution of the proposed research is analyzing large-time asymptotic behavior, which includes the study of relative value iteration algorithms and rolling horizon control. The research will also advance the understanding of the risk-sensitive asymptotically optimal scheduling policies for large-scale parallel server networks, including those in random environments that give rise to jump-diffusion and regime-switching diffusion limits. New methods involving the equivalent stochastic differential game and spatial truncation techniques will be developed to prove lower and upper bounds for asymptotic optimality. Last, but not least, this research aims to close the gap between probabilistic and analytical methods, aiming to improve the interaction between the two communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Residential buildings account for 14%-27% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the three jurisdictions and cause significant negative impact on the environment. Supported by NSF, the Science Foundation Ireland in the Republic of Ireland (RoI), and the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland (NI), this joint research aims to reduce residential building energy consumption and related GHG emissions and environmental impacts across the three jurisdictions. The research will create decision support tools to inform policy makers, planners, and other stakeholders about the most beneficial residential retrofitting solutions at multiple scales (local to national). The methodology employed will lie at the confluence of various expertise, including green engineering of the NI team, building energy modeling and machine learning of the U.S. team, and information theory of the RoI team. The aim is to transform diverse public datasets in the three jurisdictions into actionable information. Empowered by this information, the anticipation is that better decisions can guide modern societies towards transformative green solutions for the built environment that leverage sustainable engineering systems and enable the creation of energy-efficient, healthy, and comfortable buildings for a nation's citizens. The approach is cognizant of society's need to provide ecological protection while maintaining favorable economic conditions.<br/><br/>This joint research seeks to provide the foundational science needed to design, optimize, and deploy green engineering approaches that reduce residential building energy consumption and related GHG emissions. The interdisciplinary research targets to yield three results: 1) A methodology for data ingestion and an ontology and associated server that provides both a means of accessing and subsequently homogenizing data for both the data enrichment and the modeling processes. The intent is to enable previously unused data sources to be utilized as a whole to significantly improve the accuracy of modeling processes; 2) An advanced automated building energy model generation method powered by physics-informed machine learning, which can improve the efficiency of model generation, significantly reduce computing demand for large scale building energy prediction and protect building users' privacy. Algorithms will also be created to enable robust prediction with incomplete datasets; 3) A new complementary solution for predicting the GHG emissions reduction potential for stakeholders will be created to analyze near/zero GHG buildings in terms of energy performance. It is anticipated that these results will be beneficial both in terms of making buildings greener by reducing GHG emissions and energy consumption as well as decreasing operational costs. The plan is to seek the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to adopt the research results in their national building energy policy analysis for 139 million homes. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive will utilize this work to help predict decarbonization pathways for their housing stock of nearly 86,000 homes (10% of the housing stock in NI). The research will also assist the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for its retrofit plan of 500,000 homes in the Republic of Ireland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Corrective measures have been adopted, such as side-payments for cost recovery, but at the expense of compromising transparency. The issue of transparency has been a persistent concern from the stakeholders: the rationale behind a market mechanism is unclear, the settlement process is obscure, the evidence of effectiveness is insufficient, and so forth. While the wholesale electricity markets throughout the U.S. have been redesigned after the California electricity crisis, there remain a lot of ambiguities arising from the sophisticated market rules, resulting in many long-lasting litigations. Moreover, emerging market mechanisms including virtual transactions may bring in additional gaming opportunities, which can be further exacerbated by the lack of transparency. This project aims to better understand and resolve the pricing challenges arising from non-convexities, thus enabling more transparency in electricity market design. The integrated research and education activities, including the Energy Immersion Week which provides hands-on opportunities for students, will promote participation in STEM, improve STEM education and educator development, and increase public energy literacy and engagement in energy efficiency programs.<br/><br/>The goal of this five-year project is to build analytical frameworks to understand, evaluate, and adapt the evolving market mechanisms, toward the long-term goal of creating market mechanisms and providing policy recommendations that enhance the transparency, reduce the manipulation, and ultimately improve the efficiency of electricity markets. Given that the underlying engineering details are typically highly abstracted in policymaking, this project will recognize and incorporate the intricate operational constraints in power systems into economic modeling, elevating the role of engineers in market design. Following a convergence approach of engineering, economics, operations research, and data science, this project will advance the state of knowledge in electricity market design regarding: (1) comprehensive comparison of different combinations of pricing and uplift schemes; (2) game-theoretic modeling and analysis of strategic bidding in the presence of uplift; (3) data-driven characterization of two-settlement, networked systems; (4) theoretical and empirical evaluation of the efficiency impact of virtual transactions; (5) analysis of uplift allocation rules for virtual transactions; and (6) design of financial instruments and operating paradigms for increased situational awareness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond that, they have provided crucial information to other sciences, such as archaeology, where language data is placed alongside other kinds of data in order to reconstruct human prehistory, and cultural anthropology.  The nature of the project is such that it will lead to the creation of proposals focused on questions largely shaped by Native Americans. The insights of such PIs about their languages and cultures are likely to lead them to focus on important research on topics that have been neglected by outside scholars and, thereby, expand the range of scientific advances that can be supported by research on Native American languages.

These technologies utilize machine learning algorithms to detect important health events and to predict impending medical complications. Currently, however, machine learning algorithms for these systems are designed based on sensor data that are collected and labeled/annotated in controlled environments such as laboratory settings and clinics. This process of data collection, data annotation, and algorithm training has created great impediments to scalability of wearable systems because (1) collecting and labeling sufficiently large amounts of sensor data is a time consuming, labor-intensive, expensive, and often infeasible task; and (2) wearables are deployed in highly dynamic environments of the end-users whose physical, behavioral, social, and environmental context undergo consistent changes. Such changes result in drastic decline in the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms trained in controlled environments. Therefore, it is important to develop autonomously reconfigurable machine learning algorithms as wearable sensors, settings in which they are utilized, and their configuration changes. This project introduces computational autonomy as an overarching solution for training accurate machine learning algorithms, without human supervision, in highly dynamic, unpredictable, and uncontrolled settings. The successful conclusion of this work will enable future wearables to learn in-situ autonomously, operate in-the-wild reliably, and adapt to the changing context of their users automatically. <br/><br/>This project will develop foundations of computational autonomy for wearable-based health monitoring and interventions through the following research objectives: (1) investigating methods of automatic and autonomous labeling of sensor data in a new setting based on labeled sensor data collected in a different setting by designing combinational optimization methodologies for cross-subject, cross-context, cross-platform, and cross-modality sensor data mapping; (2) developing non-parametric label refinement algorithms to reliably infer labels in a new setting based on uncertain and sporadic knowledge obtained from another, potentially unreliable and heterogeneous, sensor; (3) exploring methodologies for training machine learning algorithms that are robust to unknown parameters of a source sensor and adaptive to dynamically changing signal attributes of the new setting; and (4) validating the developed algorithms and tools through both in-lab experiments and in-the-wild user studies.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project will not only address the technical challenges in developing highly performant wearable systems but will also enable actual monitoring of a variety of populations. The work has major broader impacts on conducting high-precision chronic disease management and on the availability of wearable-based consumer applications. This has the potential to lead to the development of products around the concept of computational autonomy and its use in automation of health management, as well as, applications yet to be envisioned. The interdisciplinary nature of this work will provide unique opportunities for integrated research and education. To  this end, the educational objectives will focus on developing a new ambassador program to increase interest of underrepresented minority community college students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) careers in general and in computer science and engineering careers in particular, developing a novel patron program to improve retention of transferred underrepresented minority students through student and parental exposure to wearable-based health monitoring research, engaging undergraduate students in research, and establishment of an interdisciplinary research-based curriculum on computational autonomy. All the data produced over the course of this project, including design methodologies, software algorithms and tools, experimental data, publications, and curriculum will be made publicly available at http://epsl.eecs.wsu.edu/.

This project serves the national interest by advancing the science needed to understand the long-term fate of hydrocarbon contaminants in the Earth. Geophysical tools that have been traditionally implemented to locate oil reservoirs and mineral deposits will be used to explore how geophysical signals provide diagnostic information on the progress of contaminant transformations that are largely driven by microbes in the Earth. This exploration of the linkages between biogeochemical processes and geophysical signals over time at an oil contaminated site may provide the knowledge needed to reliably deploy relatively simple geophysical measurement systems to monitor the long-term fate of oil spills. In the same way that medical imaging uses non-invasive sensing of the human body, non-invasive geophysical sensing of contaminant plumes might ultimately be used to understand the subsurface Earth without the need to drill into it. A non-invasive approach to monitoring the health of the human-impacted subsurface Earth would limit exposure of humans and animals to contaminants and negate unwanted transport of contaminants along pathways caused by invasive drilling methods. The research will be performed by undergraduate students performing field-based research in collaboration with government scientists from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The project will engage minority undergraduate geoscience students from urban, economically disadvantaged neighborhoods in northern New Jersey. Results of the research will be shared with other scientists and students by running a workshop on geophysical signals associated with contaminant plumes. <br/><br/>Transitional environments such as hyporheic and water table fluctuation zones (WTFZ) are biogeochemical hotspots where hydrologic processes driven by recharge events cause electron donor/acceptor mixtures that enhance microbial metabolism. Hydro-biogeochemical processes in transitional environments are challenging to study using hydrological, microbial and geochemical proxies due to the spatio-temporal and dynamic nature of these systems. Geochemical and microbial processes/transformations occurring within the WTFZ at organic-rich contaminated sites give rise to magnetic susceptibility (MS) and self potential (SP) electrical signals that show evidence of being regulated by recharge events and changes in water level. Understanding of the biogeochemical factors resulting in the measured geophysical responses, as needed to apply these techniques to investigate hydro-biogeochemical processes at field sites, remains incomplete. This project will pursue interdisciplinary research at a highly characterized site where decades of hydrological, geochemical and microbiological data are available to interpret the driving mechanisms causing geophysical signatures. It will integrate undergraduate education with basic research to advance understanding of the origins of such biogeophysical signatures and how they are regulated by variable hydrologic conditions. Supporting laboratory studies will be performed to constrain the linkages between iron cycling and biogeophysical signatures within the WTFZ. Datasets will be acquired to address the following hypotheses: [1] Transient magnetic susceptibility profiles result from hydrologically-driven iron cycling in the source zone; [2] Magnetic susceptibility changes in hydrocarbon source zones result from the consumption of iron-oxyhydroxides initially present on the sediments; [3] Transient self potential signatures are associated with recharge-driven modifications of dissolved or gas phase electron acceptors; [4] A microbial-mediated Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couple drives a biogeobattery causing an anomalous self potential profile through the WTFZ in the source zone.  Hypotheses will be explored by a combination of field geophysical measurements, in situ geochemical measurements on sediment packets suspended in boreholes and laboratory simulations of the WTFZ zone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Himalayas began rising many millions of years ago when India collided with Asia, which changed Earth?s climate, altered ocean circulation and chemistry, and impacted the course of biological evolution. Erosion of the Himalayas resulted in deposition of the largest pile of sediment on the planet in the Bay of Bengal, the deep-sea Bengal Fan. Within this sediment record lies the history of the Himalayas ? the now eroded Mt. Everests of the past, buried under sediment of the continental shelf and the deepest parts of the Indian Ocean.  In 2015, a multi-national expedition on the JOIDES Resolution, a specially designed scientific drilling ship, recovered ~1.5 miles of sediment cores that contains this record. New research will use these sediments to trace the history of Himalayan erosion and how two of the world?s largest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra, delivered it to the Bay of Bengal over the last 3-5 million years.  Giant mountain ranges like the Himalayas are a rarity through geologic history, but without the Himalayas there are no drenching Asian monsoons, no fertile floodplains or aquifers, no ancient Indus Civilization, and no Mt. Everests in that part of the world.  The results of this research will therefore tell us about climate change, landscape evolution, and how one of the world?s most densely populated areas came to be as seen today.  Understanding the past in this way can help us better understand the future for the 10% of the world?s population that lives under the influence of this incredible geographic feature.  This project also supports international collaboration between scientists and students from several universities in the U.S., the U.K. and several Asian countries where field work will be conducted.<br/><br/>The Himalaya-sourced Ganges-Brahmaputra river system and the deep-sea Bengal Fan represent Earth?s largest source-to-sink sediment-dispersal system.  IODP Expedition 354 drilled a 7-site transect in the middle Bengal Fan, almost 1000 miles from the modern Ganges-Brahmaputra delta shoreline, to expand the record of erosion and sediment routing from the Himalaya to the deep sea.  Previous research examined detrital-zircon (DZ) U-Pb data from sandy turbidites in IODP 354 core to summarize Miocene to middle Pleistocene patterns of sediment routing: this research identified major changes in specific DZ U-Pb age populations that correspond to the Plio-Pleistocene transition, and indicate major changes in provenance due to environmental forcing.  New research will build on earlier results and examine climatic and tectonic processes that drove this provenance change.  This research will be grounded on analyses of 25 new samples of Plio-Pleistocene sand from IODP 354 core, which represent sand transport to the Bengal Fan during glacial periods when sea level was low, as well as 60 new river sand samples from the modern Ganges-Brahmaputra drainage that will be used to establish patterns characteristic of the Holocene interglacial monsoon-dominated climate.  Detrital zircons and rutiles recovered from the sand fraction in these samples will be used as the primary signal carrier and will be analyzed for U-Pb geochronology, with zircons examined for (U-Th)/He thermochronology and Hafnium isotopes as well.  These samples and methods will fingerprint contributions from the main tectonostratigraphic units of the Himalaya to the Bengal Fan in glacial vs. interglacial periods and show how Himalayan erosion and sediment routing to the deep sea changes over time.  The dataset generated will serve the community as a baseline for decades, and will be leveraged as a tool for public outreach at professional meetings and workshops that emphasize source-to-sink concepts and how the Himalaya to Bengal fan system responds to and records climate change and tectonic activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award is to gain a deeper understanding of the role that error management cognitive bias plays in design process, and to identify and test means to mitigate that bias. Error management biases decision-making toward errors that are less costly. In design practice, error management may relate to concerns like self-preservation of one's livelihood or conservation of resources. Cognitive-based engineering design studies are performed with the perspective that if we can understand the way that designers think and work, we will be able to determine the practices, methods, tools, environments, and stimulation that lead to the best design output. Error management bias is a permeating presence in all human decision-making, and a clearer picture of its effects on design could fundamentally improve the way design problems are solved. A deeper, more complete understanding of the role of error management bias in design will also enhance design education techniques and learning outcomes. The educational objective of this CAREER award is to contribute to increasing the diversity of STEM fields, with particular focus on strengthening the pipeline through programming for K-12 girls and young women and racial minorities. In partnership with the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, GA, a three-part project will be executed: 1) engage a diverse national audience of children in Title I schools through a puppet-based, STEM-focused Distance Learning curriculum; 2) provide a local interactive, puppet-based, STEM education experience geared toward girls and minority children in the Atlanta area; and 3) provide a service learning experience for Georgia Tech engineering undergraduate students to engage in mentorship of girls and minority children through a cooperative STEM puppet exhibit design course. Through the these educational activities, underrepresented K-12 students, locally and nationally, will gain more interest in, and self-efficacy for, pursuing STEM studies and careers. Ultimately, by increasing diversity in STEM fields, more successful teams and innovation outcomes will be possible.<br/><br/>This research is focused on furthering the development of new fundamental knowledge in the areas of design theory and methodology to gain a deeper understanding of the role that error management bias plays in the way design practice is performed and learned. Error management biases can include loss aversion bias, status quo bias, context-dependent preferences and many more. The specific goals are: 1) to gain a deeper understanding of the role that error management bias plays in design process; 2) to identify means to mitigate error management bias in the design process; and 3) to test and validate the means to mitigate error management bias in the design process. In design practice, error management bias could be beneficial, or dangerous, when it comes to decision-making. When approaching the study of error management biases in design, it will be important not only to recognize when, where and how these biases manifest, but also the potential impact of the biases on the design outcomes--which may not necessarily be negative. This research approach is centered on in-situ, ethnographic, and laboratory based studies of design practice in novices and expert designers to uncover and study the most prevalent forms of error management biases in design, as well as techniques for their mitigation, in detail. By studying error management biases in design more broadly and deeply, researchers and practitioners will be able to understand and improve design practice for more objective, rational actions and decision-making and, ultimately, better design innovation outcomes. This research will help to open up a broad, relatively unexplored area of inquiry in design theory and methods research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By using group testing instead of individual testing, for most problem settings of practical interest, one is guaranteed significant savings in the number of tests performed and consequently, significant reductions in reporting delays and experimental costs. Group testing is especially desirable when monitoring the spread of infectious diseases such as Covid-19, which requires frequent examinations of massive populations. Although many ad-hoc approaches to group testing for infectious diseases have been put forward, little work has addressed the problem of end-to-end group-testing protocol design, which includes the selection of genetic regions for viral/bacterial identification, mathematical modeling and analysis of the test results and the development of guiding protocols for communal testing strategies. The overarching goals of the project are to determine which group-testing methods can actually mitigate the spread of Covid-19 and other diseases and to what extent, to estimate the reduction in the number of infected individuals achievable through the use of pooled real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, and to aid in the employment of Mobile Testing Units that can reach geographically remote regions. Other broader societal impacts include increased readiness for fighting future pandemics and training a new cohort of young researchers on interdisciplinary topics involving machine learning, coding theory and bioinformatics. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop specialized machine-learning, combinatorial and information-theoretic methods for (a) identifying genomic regions with predictably low-mutation rates that may be used as amplification primers for gold-standard real-time polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) and determining best mixing strategies based on the likelihood of infection; (b) developing adequate models for amplification curves generated by RT-PCR and corresponding test-errors; (c) formulating experimental-protocol-specific non-adaptive and adaptive semiquantitative group testing schemes that account for nonbinary test outcomes; (d) addressing the testing issues associated with high-viral load subjects and heavy-hitter communities; and (e) integrating the mathematical techniques developed into an agent-based model for disease spreading and control in order to assess the potential impact of group testing and recommend effective test-quarantine-retest strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Distances are also central to the definition of divergence measures, relative entropy and information gain, some of which are fundamental to the concept of C.R. Rao's quadratic entropy and the analysis of diversity in ecology and other areas of science. Yet, at present there are significant gaps in our knowledge and in the emerging statistical literature on the use of distance-based tests and analyses for complex high dimensional data.  One example is analysis of similarity which is among the most cited and most widely used distance-based statistical methods but is limited by an absence of relevant mathematical knowledge. This research will derive new mathematical knowledge on various distance-based statistical methods, and apply this for providing answers to important scientific questions arising in a number of disciplines in forestry, ecology and marine science, such as: (1) how biodiversity changes in tropical forests? (2) how taxonomic and functional profiles of bacterial communities change with environmental conditions in different oceanic regions? The project establishes collaborations among several disciplines and between two US academic institutions and provides research and training to graduate and undergraduate students.<br/> <br/>The project develops a new body of knowledge on distance-based statistical methods and computation for analyzing complex, high dimensional data that arise in the form of compositions, trees, graphs, or networks. The distances considered here are all non-Euclidean -- either non-metric dissimilarities that do not satisfy any triangular inequalities or just discrete numbers -- but they all arise from conditionally positive definite kernels. Examples of distances include the squared Euclidean distance, the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, the Jensen-Shannon distance, Unifrac or the Kantorovich-Rubinstein metric, the Aitchison distance, the edit distance, various graph kernel and spectral distances, and other distances based on optimal transport problems. Specifically, the project advances the mathematical theory and computation of exact distribution-free two and multi-sample runs tests, change points, and other related problems by counting runs along the shortest Hamiltonian path (or loop) of the pooled sample of data points. The project also considers analysis of similarity and related distance-based rank tests and derives new mathematical results that allow us to pursue more advanced statistical analyses. The project contributes to: (i) a deeper analysis of biodiversity in tropical forest; (ii)  an investigation of  how taxonomic and functional profiles of prokaryotic communities  change  with environmental conditions in different oceanic regions; (iii) a study of the variability of composition of rare earth elements in deep-sea muds of the Pacific Ocean;  and (iv) an understanding of the relationship of intertidal communities in the Oregon coast with respect to upwelling and nutrient delivery.

However, no major efforts have been made to understand tropical sea anemone diversity since the advent of modern DNA sequencing. Compounding a lack of research, sea anemones have few physical characteristics that are useful for discerning between species and classic DNA sequencing approaches have been ineffective for discovering new taxa. Thus, it is likely that tropical sea anemone diversity is vastly underdescribed, and new genomic approaches are needed to simultaneously discover species, place them into broader evolutionary context, and determine what physical sea anemone characteristics are informative at every taxonomic level. This study will explore the evolutionary processes that have given rise to tropical sea anemone diversity by focusing on the clownfish-hosting sea anemones. The clownfish-sea anemone symbiosis has been a model for exploring fundamental biological processes, but prior research has focused almost exclusively on clownfish. The presence of undescribed sea anemone hosts will re-write our understanding of the clownfish-sea anemone symbiosis, shed light on the origin of tropical anemone diversity, and transform the interpretation of dozens of studies across scientific disciplines. This research will result in modern natural history collection resources for tropical sea anemone diversity. Outreach and educational opportunities for undergraduate students and the general public will take place at the American Museum of Natural History. Citizen science initiatives will result in the formation of the first long-term data platform to track the distribution and abundance of the clownfish sea anemones. Updated sea anemone species descriptions will be valuable for establishing scientifically-based conservation initiatives in the ornamental aquarium trade.<br/><br/>Researchers will conduct major field research collecting expeditions to Madagascar, Western Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the Marshall Islands. All individual sea anemones sampled in this study will be photographed underwater. Resulting images and ecological metadata will be uploaded to public digital biodiversity databases. New sea anemone species will be discovered using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and newly developed bait-capture probes for Class Anthozoa targeting Ultra Conserved Element loci. Resulting genomic data will be used for testing three key questions regarding tropical sea anemone diversity and the clownfish-sea anemone symbiosis: 1) What is the true species-level diversity of the clownfish-hosting sea anemones? 2) Do host sea anemones share a common biogeographic origin with clownfishes? 3) Are the tropics a center or origin, or accumulation, of sea anemone biodiversity? These data, which will be shared in public repositories, will provide the first comparative genomic systematic study on tropical sea anemone diversity, the clownfish-hosting sea anemones, and the anemone superfamily Actinioidea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interestingly, seeds of flowering plants often bear additional biological diversity in the form of partnering fungi and bacteria. Diverse impacts of seed-borne fungi include enhanced protection of host plants from parasites, pathogens and drought, as well as effects on diversity of their ecosystems. Recently, one fungus was even shown to donate a disease resistance gene to a wild relative of wheat. This study employs cutting-edge methods in ecology, genomics and other biological sciences to research the diversity of plants and their seed-borne fungal partners in the U.S. and in China, a global hotspot for plant diversity. Results will guide efforts to preserve biological diversity and promote healthy, resilient and productive natural ecosystems, rangelands and pastures. Outputs to the public and the scientific community will enhance knowledge of plant-microbe symbiosis as a key dimension of diversity. The research and educational exchange activities will strengthen and diversify scientific collaboration between scientists and students in China and the U.S., provide training to graduate students and postdocs in a broad range of biological and bioinformatic sciences, and integrate field, classroom, and lab activities for K-12 and undergraduate students to discover microscopic and macroscopic layers of biological complexity.<br/><br/>This project will first entail a survey for seed-borne fungal endophytes across the taxonomic range of flowering plants, with emphasis on the plant diversity in China. The GBOWS (Germplasm Bank of Wild Species) seed collection in Kunming, China encompasses 37% of Chinese flowering plant species, and this and other collections will be surveyed to examine occurrence and possible roles of fungal seed-endophytes in the diversity of flowering plants. Then, endophyte-symbiotic plant species will be surveyed over wide geographic ranges to elucidate interactions of different ?dimensions? of diversity of the target plants and their symbionts. Such dimensions will include genetics, gene expression, morphological characteristics, and ecological effects. These studies will also extend to neighboring plants that grow in association with the target species and the seed-endophytes that they, too, might possess. To complement these broad-scale surveys, the third objective will involve field experiments, conducted jointly with K-12 schools, to test how seed-borne fungal endophytes of grasses and legumes may drive diversity of their hosts and the broader plant community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
